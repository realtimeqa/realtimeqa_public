Conde had changed the constitution to allow himself to stand for a third term in office in 2020, sparking widespread anger.\n\nMany of Conde’s opponents, including FNDC leaders, cautiously welcomed the coup, but relations with Doumbouya’s junta have since soured.\n\nLast month, the main opposition parties rejected a 36-month transition to democratic elections that was approved by the interim parliament. The protests on Wednesday took place in neighbourhoods known as bastions of opposition support.\n\nIn its statement, the FNDC said the security forces’ response “contrasts with Colonel Doumbouya’s rhetoric when he took power, which excoriated killings during protests”.\n\nFollowing criticism of the 36-month timeline, the junta last month banned all public demonstrations, drawing a rebuke from the United Nations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/americas/cuba-protest-sentencing-intl", "title": "Cuba's anti-government protesters sentenced up to 30 years behind ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCuba’s Supreme Court sentenced more than 100 protesters in Havana to prison terms that ranged between four and 30 years for violence committed during demonstrations last year, it announced Wednesday in a statement.\n\n“The citizens are accused of committing and provoking serious disturbances and acts of vandalism, with the purpose of destabilizing public order, collective security and citizen tranquility,” the Supreme Court said.\n\nLast July, hundreds of Cubans across the country defied the government and took to the streets against chronic shortages and lack of basic freedoms.\n\nDespite widespread calls following the protests for amnesty, the Cuban government has come down hard on demonstrators – meting out lengthy prison sentences.\n\nShortly after the protests started, police and special forces went door to door looking for those who participated.\n\nProtesters demonstrate in rare protests in Havana, Cuba, on July 11, 2021.

He was then told that if he engaged in any more “activism” he and his family would be hunted down and arrested, he said.\n\nWhat Arman claims happened to him and those allegedly detained alongside him isn’t an isolated incident. Instead, it’s part of a tried and tested playbook used by the Iranian government to stalk, torture and imprison protesters, in an ongoing campaign to squash political dissent.\n\nArman, whose name has been changed for his safety, says he was tasered before being detained. Arman\n\nIn the months following Iran’s nationwide demonstrations in 2019, which were sparked by the government’s abrupt decision to increase the price of gas by 50% but snowballed into calls for the fall of the Islamic Republic and its leaders, widespread accounts of torture and thousands of arrests were documented.\n\nAs Iranians from all walks of life unite to fight for their civil rights – in protests first sparked by the death of a young woman in religious police custody last month – it appears to be happening again.\n\n“We are now in the worst time of our life. Full of stress. Full of fear,” a 24-year-old female protester told CNN. She says several of her friends were tortured – and that one of them was also sexually violated – after being detained by the IRGC in Rasht last month.\n\n“Nothing has happened to me yet and I was able to escape. But it is possible at any moment,” she explained during a video call about the incident, her face covered to protect her identity.\n\nCNN has spoken to almost a dozen Iranians who have shared first-hand accounts of torture in either the 2019 and 2022 protests, or who have had loved ones die or disappear while in the custody of authorities.\n\nSome of those impacted shared photographs documenting their injuries as well as court records detailing the criminal charges they’re facing; others shared only their stories, which CNN cannot independently verify.\n\nCNN contacted the Iranian government as well as its permanent mission to the United Nations regarding the accounts of torture and arbitrary detention detailed by protesters but has yet to receive a response.\n\nA group of people look out from what appears to be a security van in Tehran, as an officer stands nearby. Twitter\n\n‘There were rapes, torture’\n\nFarhad, a 37-year-old father-of-two, intimately understands the personal cost of speaking out against the Iranian government, but it hasn’t stopped him from joining the demonstrations which have continued for more than a month now and seem to transcend Iran’s social and ethnic divisions.\n\nIn the November 2019 protests, he says he watched several of his friends die on the streets of Tehran after being gunned down by security forces, in what would be a four-day nationwide rampage to silence dissent that ultimately left more than 300 civilians dead, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIt wasn’t until December 2, in the aftermath of the bloodshed, that Farhad says plain-clothes officers kicked down his door in the middle of the night to arrest him for his involvement in the demonstrations.\n\nFarhad, whose name has also been changed for his security, says the IRGC used footage of the protests from the BBC – which he has since shared with CNN – to identify him, effectively weaponizing the media coverage of the rallies to hunt down participants.\n\nIranian police patrol in the capital Tehran on October 8, 2022. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe claims he was tortured for 16 days in total and like Arman, that he knew the Tehran detention center in which he was being held was run by the IRGC because of a sign on one of its walls displaying its distinctive insignia.\n\nIn Farhad’s telling, several hundred people were detained and tortured alongside him. He still hears their screams.\n\n“Hundreds of people were imprisoned with me. There was a bed, people were being tied to it and abused. There were rapes, torture with electric shocks and boiling water … they were hanging people from the ceiling to beat them,” he told CNN.\n\nFarhad’s last memory from his time in that dark room is when he was hung up and beaten senseless by plain-clothes officers before being thrown in the back of a car, driven to an undisclosed location and dumped on the side of the road.\n\nDays later he woke up in a medical clinic near his house in Tehran, he said. He doesn’t know how he got there but cites an extended family member with links to Iran’s government as a possible reason his life was spared.\n\n“My teeth were broken; my lip was completely torn off. Because my bleeding was so severe, I [think] they did not expect me to survive.”\n\nCNN has reviewed photographs of Farhad’s injuries and the scarring he lives with today.\n\nFarjad has since left Tehran with his immediate family for their safety, but says he still receives late-night phone calls from Iranian authorities threatening to rape his wife and kill his children, and that his bank account is periodically frozen.\n\nHe also claims that in the months following his torture, his national identity card – the primary document used to access essential services in Iran – was wiped from the system.\n\nDespite the ongoing risks to his life and livelihood, Farhad’s commitment to the current demonstrations is unwavering.\n\n“My country and my people are suffering. The government of the Islamic Republic oppresses in the name of religion, I can’t see people [being] killed for their beliefs anymore,” he said.\n\nCNN spoke with four more protesters who were tortured while in detention and later imprisoned for taking part in anti-government demonstrations in 2019 – including a young single mother who says she has had to place her son in the care of her parents in order to serve prison time, and a 43-year-old father of two from Shiraz who says he suffers from acute post-traumatic stress disorder, after spending 48 days in solitary confinement.\n\nTheir accounts all share striking similarities, most notably the ongoing harassment they say their families face from Iranian authorities via fake social media accounts, late-night phone calls, and local informants whom they believe monitor them for the IRGC intelligence service.\n\nAmin Sabeti is an Iranian cyber security expert who has spent years studying hacking groups with ties to the Islamic Republic, including the IRGC-affiliated ‘Charming Kitten’ group, which was recently sanctioned by the US government for “malicious cyber-enabled activities, including ransomware and cyber-espionage.”\n\nAccording to Sabeti, who is based in the UK, state-sponsored hackers have a tried and tested method in place to “dox protesters” once they’ve infiltrated their online groups using fake accounts, which involves “sharing photos of them on Twitter, Instagram or Telegram and asking others to share information about them,” while pretending to be concerned for their safety.\n\n“They used the same tactics in the November 2019 uprising,” Sabeti explained, which has led to more tech-savvy demonstrators identifying suspicious accounts and distributing warnings among their networks.\n\nA history of torture\n\nAt Tehran’s Ebrat Museum – a repurposed former prison – dramatic displays on the atrocities carried out against Muslim clerics by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s police during the revolution have long been used as a propaganda tool to celebrate the “freedoms” won in the Islamic Republic.\n\nAnd yet, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who was himself imprisoned in the 1970s during Pahlavi’s reign – and his security apparatus, have a decades-long legacy of also using mass arrests and torture to control and silence political dissidents – the hypocrisy of which is not lost on protesters today.\n\nThe current movement – led and inspired by women – has united Iranians across generations, in what is shaping up to be the biggest threat the regime has faced to date. Notably, it has also survived weeks of rolling internet outages and violent crackdowns.\n\nBut as chants of “woman, life, freedom” continue – a rallying cry that’s come to encompass the daily violence and control Iranian women are rising up against – more than 1,000 people have been arrested, according to state news IRNA.\n\nPeople gather next to a burning motorcycle in Tehran amid the protests on October 8. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nLooking ahead, analysts and exiled activists CNN spoke to are fearful that the authorities will ultimately employ whatever violent tactics they deem necessary to once again, regain some semblance of control.\n\nAlready, almost two dozen children – some as young as 11 – were killed by Iran’s security forces during demonstrations in September, according to Amnesty International, in a chilling reminder that no life will be spared. Meanwhile, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed last week that student protesters are now being detained in what he termed “psychological institutions,” run by the state.\n\nNone of the Iranians CNN spoke with were naive to the fact that their lives – and the lives of their families – are on the line as the uprising rages on, with most going to extreme lengths to protect their personal information online and avoid unnecessary risks while taking to the streets.\n\nArman still receives threatening phone calls and messages for his activism, but he says he won’t be deterred.\n\n“They torture us, and they are lying to the world, to the international community … Iranians want freedom,” he said. “We don’t want dictatorship. We want to connect with the world.”", "authors": ["Hannah Ritchie Teele Rebane", "Hannah Ritchie", "Teele Rebane"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/white-house-musk-starlink-iran-protests-ukraine", "title": "CNN Exclusive: After Ukraine, Biden administration turns to Musk's ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe White House has engaged in talks with Elon Musk about the possibility of setting up SpaceX’s satellite internet service Starlink inside Iran, multiple officials familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nThe conversations, which have not been previously reported, come as the Biden administration searches for ways to support the Iranian protest movement that exploded just over a month ago after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died under suspicious circumstances after being detained by the country’s morality police.\n\nThe White House sees Starlink’s compact, easy-to-use technology as a potential solution to the Iranian regime’s aggressive efforts to restrict activists’ internet access and communications.\n\n“We have our foot on the gas to do everything we possibly can to support the aspirations of the Iranian people,” a senior administration official told CNN. “That is our policy, period. At the same time, it is truly an Iranian movement led by young girls and spreading to other aspects of society. And we do not want to in any way eclipse their movement.”\n\nIf a plan is enacted, it would be the second major theater this year — along with Ukraine — where the US government has turned to Starlink to help provide crucial telecommunication services, even as questions swirl around Musk’s reliability in his dealings with the US government.\n\n“He’s a loose cannon we can never predict,” said a senior US defense official familiar with the government’s discussions with Musk and SpaceX about Ukraine.\n\nSpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, June 13, 2019. Mike Blake/Reuters/FILE\n\nConcerns over Musk’s unpredictable tendencies intensified after CNN first reported last week that Musk’s company, SpaceX, had been quietly asking the Pentagon to pay tens of millions of dollars per month to fund Starlink in Ukraine and take the burden off SpaceX. In response to that reporting, Musk then abruptly announced on Twitter that he had withdrawn the funding request.\n\nThe Pentagon has said this week that talks with SpaceX about Ukraine are ongoing, after documents obtained by CNN showed SpaceX warning the Pentagon last month it could no longer fund or service Starlink in Ukraine “for an indefinite period of time.”\n\nSpaceX claims that providing Starlink services in Ukraine have cost it $80 million so far and that by the end of the year costs will exceed $100 million. SpaceX did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nA solution or a risk for Iranian activists?\n\nThe needs of Iranian protesters and Ukrainian soldiers, and how they would use Starlink, are wildly different. And experts warn that while Starlink in Ukraine has been critical to battlefield successes, getting Starlink into Iran would be a much bigger and potentially more dangerous challenge.\n\nA picture obtained by AFP outside Iran on September 21, 2022, shows Iranian demonstrators in the streets of Tehran during a protest for Mahsa Amini, days after she died in police custody. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe situation with Starlink and Ukraine does not seem to have deterred the White House from pursuing Starlink, which uses satellites to beam internet service to compact terminals on the ground. SpaceX has around 3,000 such satellites currently in orbit and roughly 20,000 terminals on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has wanted to be more bullish and openly supportive of the Iranian protesters than his former boss, President Barack Obama, who opted to largely stay out of an Iranian protest movement that erupted in 2009. Biden said in a statement on October 3 that his administration “stands with Iranian women and all the citizens of Iran who are inspiring the world with their bravery” and is trying to make it easier for Iranians to access the internet.\n\n“We are interested in finding ways to ensure that the Iranian people can have access to the internet on their phones and everywhere else,” said the senior administration official. “And so Starlink is one option, but it is not the only option.”\n\nIt is not clear whether the administration has offered to pay for the Starlink terminals to be set up in Iran. In its letter to the Pentagon in September, SpaceX said it could no longer donate Starlink terminals to Ukraine or pay for its ongoing service and requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\nSome US officials hope that Starlink’s on-the-ground terminals will one day become as prevalent in Iran as satellite TV dishes. That technology is also technically outlawed by the regime, but is nevertheless abundant across the country, the sources noted. Currently, there are “very few” Starlink terminals already operating in Iran, Musk said in a tweet last week.\n\nBut there are several glaring issues with that plan. Chief among them is that Starlink’s satellites require physical terminals on the ground to connect to, and their signals could be easy to detect. Smuggling the units across the border into Iran is just the first challenge, before they would then hypothetically be used by undisciplined protesters under the harsh gaze of Iran’s security services.\n\n“I’m really concerned that there is a lack of knowledge about the security or even training how people can hide those signals,” said Amir Rashidi, the director of internet security and digital rights at Miaan Group, who was forced to flee Iran after the 2009 protests. “It’s going to be really risky for people in Iran to use it in a massive scale.”\n\nRashidi said more instruction materials are needed, in Farsi, to help protesters understand how to better cover their tracks and use equipment safely. He argues more investment is needed on circumvention tools and work by the UN’s International Telecommunication Union.\n\nUS-backed efforts, he said, carry significant risk.\n\n“As soon as we get arrested, the first charge is you’re a spy, you’re working for CIA, you’re working for a British intelligence service,” he said. “If the US government is involved in distribution then that would be another crime in the eyes of the Iranian Government and people might be charged with it, really difficult and hard charges.”\n\n‘Why haven’t we figured this out sooner?’\n\nWhile support for protesters’ means of communication is an area where the administration feels it can take concrete action, a criticism of the administration is that it’s only being seriously addressed now.\n\n“Why haven’t we figured this out sooner?” one person involved in the discussions told CNN. “We’re putting so much effort into the JCPOA [nuclear deal]. It’s an ongoing national security interest to get rid of this regime. Here’s how: empower those democrats on the ground in Iran and the number one way to do it is to find ways to support tech like that in the country, and we haven’t, we’ve failed.”\n\nThe senior administration official told CNN that right now, the JCPOA is “not on the agenda.” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby echoed that on Thursday, telling reporters that “we are way far apart with the Iranians in terms of a return to the deal.”\n\n“What we are focused on is making sure we are holding the regime accountable for the way they are treating protesters in the country,” he said.\n\nThe White House, government technologists and Musk and his team are still working, though, to address the biggest challenges with Starlink and other communications technologies, officials said.\n\n“When it comes to more active USG involvement, without getting into specific technologies, we’re always considering whether a technology would put those who use it at risk of being identified and harmed by their government in some way,” the senior administration official said. “All elements of the Biden administration are in lockstep on that.”\n\nThe official also touted the benefits of a policy change the Biden administration made last month in an effort to expand internet services to Iranians. The license issued by the Treasury Department would give US technology companies greater freedom to operate in highly-sanctioned Iran.\n\n“The beauty of General License D-2 is that it allows private companies to decide for themselves what products and services to offer inside Iran,” the official said.\n\nMusk’s unpredictability over Ukraine raises concern\n\nMusk has said that if the terminals can get into Iran, SpaceX has already activated the signal. But the way he has acted in the discussions around Ukraine have only added to concerns about the considerable influence the world’s richest man may now have over some of the world’s biggest conflicts.\n\nSpaceX Starlink internet terminal installed in Odesa, southern Ukraine, March 15, 2022. Nina Lyashonok/Ukrinform/Abaca/Sipa USA/FILE\n\nLast weekend, Musk tweeted: “To hell with it…even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding the Ukraine govt for free,” he wrote on Saturday. Then on Monday he unequivocally stated: “SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding.”\n\nEarlier this week, Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters that the department “does continue to discuss various matters with SpaceX, to include Starlink,” adding that the Pentagon had not yet paid anything for Starlink.\n\nAt the same time, there have been numerous reports of Starlink outages along the frontline as Ukraine has pushed into Russian-occupied areas. A person familiar with the discussions with SpaceX told CNN that Ukraine had to proactively make a request for service to be turned on when an area is taken back.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukraine’s defense minister Oleksiy Reznikov expressed confidence that funding for Starlink would continue, telling Politico: “I know we that we will not have a problem.” If the funding doesn’t come from SpaceX, he said, he expects the Pentagon, Europe and private donors to step up.\n\nMusk has pointed to Ukrainian officials’ public praise of SpaceX and Starlink—one senior Ukrainian official, Mykhailo Fedorov, called Musk “among the world’s top private donors supporting Ukraine”—as evidence that he is not trying to undermine the Ukrainians’ fight.\n\nWhen someone tweeted on Tuesday that Musk is “trying to bring both sides of the conflict to the same level as possible, so as to avoid a one-sided situation,” calling it “Peace at the least cost,” Musk responded: “Exactly.”\n\nStill, there remain concerns about how dependent Ukraine is on Starlink.\n\n“Ukraine needs Musk’s technology, but they don’t know if he will continue to support them,” a person familiar with the discussions between Ukraine and SpaceX said.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a researcher and expert on connectivity in conflicts, called the success of Starlink in Ukraine “great marketing,” but the question of how to ultimately support Iran’s protesters’ means of communication “is a huge challenge, and it’s a lot harder to see how it could be addressed by Starlink devices.”\n\n“Efforts to help should be grounded in understanding how Iranians communicate, the risks they face, and the censorship-circumvention technologies they have experience using. We should be engaged, but wary of silver bullet ideas.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/02/vp-candidates-jd-vance-and-tim-walz-debate-read-the-full-transcript-2024-election/75455777007/", "title": "VP candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz debate.

Tim Walz faced off in New York City Tuesday night for the 2024 vice presidential debate, sparring over heated issues including abortion, border security and the economy.\n\nThe debate, which went slightly above 90 minutes, was moderated by CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the exchange between the two vice-presidential nominees:\n\nDEBATE TRANSCRIPT\n\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Tonight, with just over a month to go until Election day, the first and only meeting between the two men who hope to become vice president of the United States, democratic Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Senator JD Vance of Ohio now, this is likely the final debate of this election cycle. And voting is already underway in 20 states. CBS news polling shows this remains a race either presidential candidate could win. The CBS news vice presidential debate starts now.\n\nJD VANCE: Fight for every single vote, and we're going to take this country back.\n\nTIM WALZ: And we are ready to continue to build the future together.\n\nJD VANCE: We're going to turn this whole country red with President Donald J. Trump's leadership.\n\nTIM WALZ: You know, it's at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.\n\nThis is a CBS news special. Live from CBS news headquarters in New York. America decides the Vice Presidential debate.\n\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Good evening. I'm Norah O'Donnell and thank you for joining us for tonight's CBS news vice presidential debate. We want to welcome our viewers on CBS, on other networks here in the US and around the world. We have a consequential night ahead, and our focus is the issues that matter to you, the voter. Let's introduce the candidates: Minnesota's democratic governor Tim Walz and Ohio's republican senator JD Vance. Tonight, meeting for the first time.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan. In order to have a thoughtful and civil debate, these are the rules that both campaigns have agreed to. Questions will be directed at one candidate who will have two minutes to respond. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes for rebuttal. Then each candidate will get another minute to make further points, with an additional 1 minute each at the discretion of the moderator. The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact check claims made by each other.\n\nNORAH O' DONNELL: CBS news reserves the right to mute the candidates microphones to maintain decorum. We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns. The stage is set. Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. Let's get started. Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises. The Middle East is on the brink of war. Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene and now a labor strike as 25,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing. We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel. But that attack failed thanks to joint US and Israeli defensive action. President Biden has deployed more than 40,000 US military personnel and assets to that region over the past year to try to prevent a regional war. Iran is weakened, but the US still considers it the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it has drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon. It is down now to one or two weeks time. Governor Walz, if you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining at home tonight. Let's keep in mind where this started. October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners. Iran, or, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute, fundamental necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today, where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack. But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment. But it's not just that. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. His Chief of Staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed humanity being he’d ever met. And both of his Secretaries of Defense and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he’s unfit for the highest office. That was Senator Vance. What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed. And as the Vice President said today, is we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, the same question, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: So, Margaret, I want to answer the question. First of all, thanks, Governor. Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate. And thanks most importantly to the American people who are watching this evening and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this Vice Presidential debate. I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are. I was raised in a working class family. My mother required food assistance for periods of her life. My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me. And she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life. I went to college on the GI bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in Iraq. And so I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams. And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable. I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again. Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States’ global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world. Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who… we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in in the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. And when Iranian missiles did fall near US troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April. Both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong, and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, the US did have a diplomatic deal with Iran to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program, and President Trump did exit that deal. He recently said just five days ago, the US must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran because the consequences are impossible. Did he make a mistake? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word, but I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary. You, yourself, just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. And, Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump, who has been the Vice President for the last three and a half years, and the answer is your running mate, not mine. Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure. Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now, and you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world. Donald Trump has already done it once before. Ask yourself at home, when, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American President didn't have a major conflict, breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was President.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, we have a lot to get to. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Margaret, thank you. Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene. The storm could become one of the deadliest on record. More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing. Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall. Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, seven in ten Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the US taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Sure. So first of all, let's start with the hurricane because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy. I just saw today, actually, a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six year old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives. And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them. And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild. I mean, these are communities that I love, some of them I know very personally. In Appalachia, all across the Southeast, they need their government to do their job. And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster. And Norah, you asked about climate change. I think this is a very important issue. Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true. Well, if you believe that, what would you, what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world. What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to? More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world. When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening. Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane, and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the Governors. I serve as co-chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements. Governors know no partisanship. They work together to… all of the Governors and the emergency responders are on the ground. Those happen on the front end. The federal government comes in, makes sure they're there, that we recover. But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused. Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen. Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past, Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in. What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration is, we've seen this investment, we've seen massive investments, the biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, has created jobs all across the country. Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio. Taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here. Two hundred thousand jobs across the country. The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sits in Minnesota. But my farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods, back to back. But what they're doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, “Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind.” We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We're also producing more clean energy. So the solution for us is to continue to move forward, that climate change is real. Reducing our impact is absolutely critical. But this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country. That's exactly what this administration has done. We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current. And that's what absolutely makes sense. And then we start thinking about, “How do we mitigate these disasters?”\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Senator. I want to give you an opportunity to respond there. The Governor mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, look, what the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing. So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this. If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies. Now, something Governor Walz said, I think is important to touch upon, because when we talk about “clean energy,” I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here. I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership. And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make the economy dirtier. We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America.\n\nTIM WALZ: We are. In Minnesota.\n\nJD VANCE: Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the components that go into those solar panels. So if you really want to make the environment cleaner, you've got to invest in more energy production. We haven't built a nuclear facility, I think one, in the past 40 years. Natural gas. We got to invest more in it. Kamala Harris has done the opposite. That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing worse by the climate.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor, would you like to respond?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have. There's no moratorium on that. We're producing more oil. But the folks know, and my… like I said, again, these are not liberal folks. These are not folks that are green, new deal folks. These are farmers that have been, drought one year, massive flooding the next year. They understand that it makes sense. Look, our number one export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms. We saw it in Minnesota this summer. And thinking about, “How do we respond to that?” we're thinking ahead on this and what Kamala Harris has been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things. The infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future. How do we make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines? How do we make sure that we're protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of. But to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign and I'll let you do whatever you want. We can be smarter about that. And an all above energy policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate. Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. We're going to turn now to immigration. The crisis at the US-Mexico border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters. Senator Vance, your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the US military to do so. Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work? For example, would you deport parents who have entered the US illegally and separate them from any of their children who were born on US soil? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: So first of all, Margaret, before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, decriminalizing illegal aliens, massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates. And what it's meant is that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country. I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction and has gotten clean. I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels. So you've got to stop the bleeding. You've got to re-implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations. And that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do? So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks, and then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work. And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation. Right now in this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost. Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris’s wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, “You know what? I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.” I wish that she would do that, it would be good for all of us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, do you care to respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the Vice President is, quote, “letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things…”\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … regarding children?\n\nTIM WALZ: The drug mule is not true. But I will say about this, about the fentanyl, because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis. And the good news on this is the last twelve months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history, 30% decrease in Ohio. But there's still more work to do. But let's go back to this on immigration. Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of the largest state and a border state in California. She's the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions. But look, we all want to solve this. Most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the Border Patrol Agents, that's the Chamber of Commerce. That's most Americans out here. That's why we had the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation’s seen. It was crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford. I know him. He's super conservative, but he's a man of principle, wants to get it done. Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation. The Border Patrol said, this is what we need in here. These are the experts. And the Chamber of Commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, pass this thing. Kamala Harris helped get there. Fifteen hundred new border agents, detection for drugs, DOJ money to speed up these adjudications on this. Just what America wants. But as soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said “No,” told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue. It gives him, what would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things? And they need to be done by the legislature. You can't just do this through the executive branch. So, look, we have the options to do this. Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big, beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime. But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator, dehumanizing people and telling them what he was going to do. As far as a deportation plan, at one point, Senator Vance said it was so unworkable as to be laughable. So that's where we're at. Pass the bill. She'll sign it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, the question was, will you separate parents from their children, even if their kids are US citizens? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Margaret, my point is that we already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris’ open border. And I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules, I said that she enabled the Mexican drug cartels to operate freely in this country, and we know that they use children as drug mules, and it is a disgrace and it has to stop. Look, I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test. For three years, Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country. And now, now that she's running for President, or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the Vice President, when she became the appointed border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop, and it will when Donald Trump is President again.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, what about our CBS news polling, which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50%, support mass deportations?\n\nTIM WALZ: Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary. But the issue on this is this is what happens when you don't want to solve it. You demonize it. And we saw this, and Senator Vance, and it surprises me on this, talking about and saying, “I will create stories to bring attention to this.” That vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican Governor said, “It's not true. Don't do it.” There's consequences for this. There's consequences. We could come together. Senator Lankford did it. We could come together and solve this if we didn't let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue. And the consequences in Springfield were the Governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergarteners to school. I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this. But by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\n\nJD VANCE: Tim…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor. Governor, your time is up. Senator, I'll give you 1 minute, but let me just ask you the question first. The governor has made the point, and I think as a sitting lawmaker, you know that Congress controls the purse strings and any funding. So you have said repeatedly that Donald Trump would, through executive action, solve this. Do you disagree that Congress controls the purse strings and would need to support many of the changes that you would actually want to implement? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job. I've been to the southern border more than our Borders are, Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol Agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job. Of course, additional resources would help. But most of this is about the President and the Vice President empowering our law enforcement to say, “If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels.” Now, Governor Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield. Look, in Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border. It is a disgrace, Tim. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, you have 1 minute to respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, it is law enforcement that asked for the bill. They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was… that's because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything. On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree. It should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done. This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then you start to make a difference in this and you start to adhere to what we know. American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, “To the least amongst us, you do unto me.” I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded, it's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Governor. And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status. Norah.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Margaret, Margaret, I think it's important because…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, senator. We have so much to get to.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: We're going to turn out of the economy. Thank you.\n\nJD VANCE: Margaret. The rules were that you guys were going to fact check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on. So there's an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\n\nJD VANCE: That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. And Kamala Harris opened up that pathway.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to.\n\nTIM WALZ: Those laws have been in the book since 1990.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen. We want to have -\n\nTIM WALZ: The CBP app has not been on the books since 1990. It's something that Kamala Harris created, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret. The economy is a top concern for voters. Each of your campaigns has released an economic plan, so let's talk about the specifics. Governor Walz, Vice President Harris unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing and a renewed child tax credit. The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by $1.2 trillion. How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit? Governor, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Thank you. And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's where we come from. We both grew up in that. We understand. So those of you out there listening tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth. And it's good. It's healthy. That's what this is supposed to happen. You should be listening. “How's this going to impact me?” The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is, one, is talking about this housing issue. The one thing is there's 3 million new houses proposed under this plan with down payment assistance on the front end. To get you in a house. A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It's foundational to where you're at. And then making sure that the things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's fairness in that. Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin. They were charging $800 before this law went into effect. As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, 12% more houses in Minneapolis, prices went down on rent, 4%. It's working. And then making sure tax cuts go to the middle class, $6,000 child tax credit. We have one in Minnesota, reduces childhood poverty by a third. We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families and then getting businesses off the ground. The law, as it stands right now, is $5,000 tax credit for small business, increasing that to $50,000. Now, this is a philosophical difference between us. Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this. He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago. He said, “You're rich as hell. I'm going to give you a tax cut.” He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top caste. What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever. Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in. Everyone agrees, including businesses. It would be destabilizing it. It would increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession. Look, this is simple for you. Where are we going? Kamala Harris has said to do the things she wants to do. We'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. When you do that, our system works best. More people are participating in it, and folks have the things that they need.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, I want to give you a moment to respond on that. But similarly, the Wharton School has done an analysis of the Trump plan and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion. My question is the same for you. How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, you're going to hear a lot from Tim Walz this evening, and you just heard it in the answer, a lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it. Because she's been the Vice President for three and a half years, she had the opportunity to enact all of these great policies. And what she's actually done instead is drive the cost of food higher by 25%, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60%, open the American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. And the fact that she isn't, tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans. Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record. A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans, and they have PhDs, but they don't have common sense and they don't have wisdom, because Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take home pay in a generation in this country, 1.5% inflation, and to boot, peace and security all over the world. So when people say that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say “Look at the record he delivered: rising take home pay for American workers.” Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the Trump tax cuts. But if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017, and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country. That is a record that I'm proud to run on and we're going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again. I know a lot of you are struggling. I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills. It's going to stop when Donald Trump brings back common sense to this country.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, do you want to respond to that? What has Kamala Harris done for the middle class?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Yeah, well, Kamala Harris’ day one was Donald Trump's failure on COVID that led to the collapse of our economy. We were already before COVID, in a manufacturing recession. But 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great Depression, 9 million jobs closed on that. That was day one. Whether it was the Infrastructure Act or other things, we moved. Now, you made a question about experts, said this, I made a note of this. “Economists don’t, can’t be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted.” Look, if you're going to be President, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does. My pro tip of the day is this, if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump. And the same thing goes with this and I ask you out there, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, whatever, how is it fair that you're paying your taxes every year and Donald Trump hasn't paid any Federal Tax 10 to last 15 years, in the last year as President? That's what's wrong with the system. There's a way around it. And he's bragged about that. We're just asking for fairness in it, and that's all you want.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: You have a minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Governor, you say trust the experts, but those same experts for 40 years said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that. They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere, it would make the middle class stronger. They were wrong about that. They were wrong about the idea that if we made America less self-reliant, less productive in our own Nation, that it would somehow make us better off. And they were wrong about it. And for the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, we're not doing it anymore. We're bringing American manufacturing back. We're unleashing American energy. We're going to make more of our own stuff. And this isn't just an economic issue. I mean, I've got three beautiful little kids at home: seven, four and two. And I love them very much. And I hope they're in bed right now. But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our children are manufactured by nations that hate us. This has to stop. And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts. We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump governed on.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor Walz, can you address that? I mean, voters say they trust Donald Trump on the economy more. Why?\n\nTIM WALZ: If you're listening tonight, and you want billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what the numbers were. Look, I'm a union guy on this. I'm not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand that, look, we produce soybeans and corn. We need to have fair trading partners. That's something that we believe in. I think the thing that most concerns me on this is, is Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China. So the rhetoric is good. Much of what the senator said right there, I'm in agreement with him on this. I watched it happen, too. I watched it in my communities and we talked about that. But we had people undercutting the right to collectively bargain. We had right to work states made it more difficult. We had companies that were willing to ship it over, and we saw people profit. Folks that, folks that are venture capital, in some cases, putting money into companies that were overseas, we're in agreement that we bring those home. The issue is Donald Trump is talking about it. Kamala Harris has a record. Two hundred fifty thousand more manufacturing jobs just out of the IRA.\n\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Yes.\n\nJD VANCE: So, appreciate that. So if you notice, what Governor Walz just did is he said, “First of all, Donald Trump has to listen to the experts.” And then when he acknowledged that the experts screwed up, he said, well, “Donald Trump didn't do nearly as good of a job as the statistics show that he did.”\n\nTIM WALZ: No, that's a gross generalization.\n\nJD VANCE: So what Tim Walz is doing. And I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay. Which, of course, he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which, of course, he did. And then you've simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense, economic principles.\n\nTIM WALZ: I hope we have a conversation on health care then.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator. Governor.\n\nJD VANCE: Please.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to ahead, gentlemen, on many topics. But right now I want to talk about personal qualifications. The Vice President is often the last voice the President hears before making consequential decisions. We want to ask you about your leadership qualities, Governor Walz. You said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew up in small, rural Nebraska, town of 400. Town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China, 35 years ago, be able to do that. I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. The issue for that was, was to try and learn. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They, look, I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for twelve years. And in Congress I was one of the most bipartisan people. Working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits. And then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice. So look, my commitment has been from the beginning, to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this right. I will say more than anything, many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life. I learned a lot about China. I hear the critiques of this. I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us. I guarantee you he wouldn't be praising Xi Jinping about COVID. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing. So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is. My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?\n\nTIM WALZ: No. All I said on this was, is, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest, went in, and from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, governor. Senator Vance, in 2016, you called your running mate, Donald Trump, unfit for the nation's highest office, and you said he could be America's Hitler. I know you've said, you've been asked many times, and you've said you regret those comments and explained, you then voted for Donald Trump in 2020. But the Washington Post reported new messages last week in which you also disparaged Trump's economic record while he was President. Writing to someone in 2020, quote, “Trump thoroughly failed to deliver his economic populism.” You're now his running mate, and you've shifted many of your policy stances to align with his. If you become Vice President, why should Americans trust that you will give Donald Trump the advice he needs to hear, and not just the advice he wants to hear? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, because I've always been open and sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the President, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans. A secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it. It's one of the reasons, Margaret, why I've done so many interviews is because I think it's important to actually explain to the American people where I come down on the issues and what changed. Now you pointed out to messages from 2020. Margaret, I've been extremely consistent that I think there were a lot of things that we could have done better in the Trump administration the first round, if Congress was doing its job. I strongly believe, and I've been a United States Senator, that Congress is not just a high-class debating society. It's not just a forum for senators and congressmen to whine about problems. It's a forum to govern. So there were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they governed the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern. And I want to talk about this tariff issue in particular, Margaret, because, you know, Tim just accused this of being a national sales tax. Look, the one thing, and you're not probably surprised to hear me praising Joe Biden, but the one thing that Joe Biden did is he continued some of the Trump tariffs that protected American manufacturing jobs. And it's the one issue, the most pro worker part of the Biden administration. It's the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden's record. Think about this. If you're trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you're going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you're not accessing our markets unless you're paying middle class Americans a fair wage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Norah.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. Now to the issue of reproductive rights. Governor Walz, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, you signed a bill into law that made Minnesota one of the least restrictive states in the nation when it comes to abortion. Former President Trump said in the last debate that. You believe abortion, quote, in the 9th month is absolutely fine. Yes or no? Is that what you support? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: That's not what the bill says. But look, this issue is what's on everyone's mind. Donald Trump put this all into motion. He brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe versus Wade, 52 years of personal autonomy. And then he tells us, oh, we send it to the states. It's a beautiful thing. Amanda Zaworski would disagree with you on it's a beautiful thing. A young bride in Texas waiting for their child at 18 weeks. She has a complication, a tear in the membrane. She needs to go in. The medical care at that point needs to be decided by the doctor. And that would have been an abortion. But in Texas, that would have put them in legal jeopardy. She went home, got sepsis, nearly dies, and now she may have difficulty having children. Or in Kentucky, Hadley Duvall, a twelve year old child raped and impregnated by her stepfather. Those are horrific. Now, when got asked about that, Senator Vance said, two wrongs don't make a right. There is no right in this. So in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe v. Wade. We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care. But look, this is not what, if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley, you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies. It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access to infertility treatments. For so many of you out there listening, me included, infertility treatments are why I have a child. That's nobody else's business. But those things are being proposed, and the catchall on this is, is, well, the states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works. This is basic human right. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, do you want to respond to the governor's claim? Will you create a federal pregnancy monitoring agency?\n\nJD VANCE: No, Norah, certainly we won't. And I want to talk about this issue because I know a lot of Americans care about it, and I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us. And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, would you like to respond and also answer the question about restrictions?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, the question got asked, and Donald Trump made the accusation that wasn't true about Minnesota. Well, let me tell you about this idea that there's diverse states. There's a young woman named Amber Thurmond. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography? There's a very real chance, had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade. When you listen to Vice President Harris talk about this subject, and you hear me talk about it, you hear us talking exactly the same. Donald Trump is trying to figure out how to get the political right of this. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vance said about what's happening. His running mate, though, does not. And that's the problem.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. Senator, let me ask you about that. He mentioned it was, I think, referring to a national ban. In the past, you have supported a Federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks. In fact, you said if someone can't support legislation like that, quote, you are making the United States the most barbaric pro-abortion regime anywhere in the entire world. My question is, why have you changed your position?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I never supported a national ban. I did during, when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial birth abortion ban in this, in place in this country at the federal level. I don't think anybody's trying to get rid of that, or at least I hope not, though I know that Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance. But, Norah, you know, one of the things that changed is in the state of Ohio, we had a referendum in 2023, and the people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position. And I think that what I learned from that, Norah, is that we've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women would love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships. And we have got to earn people's trust back. And that's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing pro-family policies. Making childcare more accessible, making fertility treatments more accessible, because we've got to do a better job at that. And that's what real leadership is.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your response?\n\nTIM WALZ: I'm going to respond on the pro abortion piece of that. No, we're not. We're pro women. We're pro freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to not be that women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may be prosecuted for providing that care. And as far as making sure that we're educating our children and giving them options. Minnesota's a state with one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. We understand that, too. We know that the options need to be available, and we make that true. We also make it, we're a top three state for the best place to raise children. But these two things to try and say that we're pro-children but we don't like this or, or you guys are pro abortion, that's not the case at all. We are pro freedoms for women to make their choices. And we're going, and Kamala Harris is making the case to make options for children more affordable. A $6,000 child tax credit. But we're not going to base out on the backs of making someone like Amber Thurmond drive 600 miles to try and get health care.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator.\n\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that? First of all, Governor, I agree with you. Amber Thurmond should still be alive. And there are a lot of people who should still be alive, and I certainly wish that she was. And maybe, you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me, but as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion, where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion. That is, I think, whether it's not pro choice or pro abortion, that is fundamentally barbaric. And that's why I use that word, Norah, is because some of what we've seen, do you want to force catholic hospitals to perform abortions against their will? Because Kamala Harris has supported suing catholic nuns to violate their freedom of conscience? We can be a big and diverse country where we respect people's freedom of conscience. And make the country more pro baby and pro family. But please.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Yes, Governor, please respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Look, this is one where there's always something there. This is a very simple proposition. These are women's decisions to make about their healthcare decisions and the physicians who know best when they need to do this, trying to distort the way a law is written, to try and make a point. That's not it at all.\n\nJD VANCE: What was I wrong about? Governor, please tell me. What was I wrong about?\n\nTIM WALZ: That is not the way the law is written. Look, I've given.\n\nJD VANCE: But how.\n\nTIM WALZ: I've given this advice on a lot of things that getting involved, getting, that's been misread. And it was fact checked at the last debate. But the point on this is, is there's a continuation of these guys to try and tell women or to get involved. I use this line on this. Just mind your own business on this. Things worked best when Roe v. Wade was in place. When we do a restoration of Roe, that works best. That doesn't preclude us from increasing funding for children. It doesn't increase us from making sure that once that child's born, like in Minnesota, they get meals, they get early childhood education, they get healthcare. So the hiding behind we're going to do all these other things when you're not proposing them in your budget? Kamala Harris is proposing them. She's proposing all those things to make life easier for families.\n\nJD VANCE: I asked a specific question, Governor. And you gave me a slogan as a response.\n\nTIM WALZ: It's not the case. It's not true. That's not what the law says. So they fact checked it with President Trump.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss. We have to move on. And we're going to be right back with much more of the CBS news Vice Presidential debate in just a moment.\n\nSecond Segment\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS news Vice Presidential debate. We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic, the leading cause of death for children and teens in America is by firearms. Senator Vance, you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi automatic rifles, including AR-15s. So let me ask you. Earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison. Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, Norah, on that particular case, I don't know the full details, but I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions. I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes, and in some cases the answer is going to be no. And the details really matter here. Of course. For example, if a kid steals a gun, that's going to be different than if a parent hands over a gun knowing that their kid is potentially dangerous. Look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids, and our oldest is now in second grade. And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school. And we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence. And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we do have to do better. And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Now, here's something that really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence. The gross majority, close to 90%, and some of the statistics I've seen of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms. And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris’s open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel. So that number, the amount of illegal guns in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years ago. But what do we do about the schools? What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and a school that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security. But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So we've got to make our schools safer, and I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, you have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare. Look, I got a, I got a 17 year old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you.\n\nJD VANCE: Awful.\n\nTIM WALZ: As a member of Congress. I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Oak parents, and they were looking at my seven year old picture on the wall. Their seven year old were dead. And they were asking us to do something. And look, I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The Vice President is. We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out. In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence. And this idea that we should just live with it. And I, here's what I do think and this is a good start to the conversation. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know there are things that worked. I've spent time in Finland and seen some Finnish schools. They don't have this happen even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country. There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there. It just doesn't make any sense. Kamala Harris, as an Attorney General, worked on this issue. She knows that it's there. No one's trying to scaremonger and say, we're taking your guns. But I ask all of you out there, do you want your school's hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go… when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills? They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix. These are things that shouldn't be that difficult. You can still keep your firearms, and we can make a difference. We have to. If you're listening tonight, this breaks your heart.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator?\n\nJD VANCE: Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17 year old witnessed the shooting. And I'm sorry about that. And I hope,\n\nTIM WALZ: I appreciate that.\n\nJD VANCE: Christ, have mercy. It is awful. And I appreciate what Tim said, actually, about Finland. ‘Cause I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly weird differences between our own country's gun violence problem and Finland is. Okay, first of all, we have way higher rates of mental health abuse or mental health substance abuse. We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem. But I do think it's a big piece of it. Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids. It doesn't earn as many headlines, but is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets. I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, but I do think at our schools, we've got to talk about more security.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, thank you. Governor, you previously opposed an assault weapons ban, but only later in your political career did you change your position. Why?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA. I was the NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety. I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at. The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides. And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves. And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that. But I want to be very careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it. But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Gentlemen, thank you. Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent. There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States and this contributes to the high housing crisis. Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit. They also promise to build 3 million new homes. Where are you building these new homes and won’t handing out that kind of money just drive up prices higher?\n\nTIM WALZ: No, it's not handing out. First, let me say this, this issue of housing. And I think those of you listening on this. The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity. It can be bought up. It can be shifted. It can be moved around. Those are not folks living in those houses. Those of you listening tonight, that house is a big deal. I bought and owned one house in my life. My mom still lives in the house where I was. And when I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight Mass, where you go with your family. We need to make it more affordable. And one of the things, as I said, this program that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching. This is something we're doing in Minnesota from that lead. We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing. It starts to make it easier. We cut some of the red tape. Local folks, look, we can't do at the Federal level, but local folks make it easier to build those homes. And then that down payment assistance. I can tell all of you out there, one of the, certainly for me, using the GI bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment. Those are things that make it there. Now, look, you're going to pay it back and you're going to pay your mortgage. Those are things that we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it. And I will give Minneapolis an example. Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates. We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in. And we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance. We get it back from people, because here's what we know. People with stable housing end up with stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to get to school. All of those things in the long run, end up saving our money. And that's the thing that I think we should be able to find some common ground in. But we can't blame immigrants for the only reason that's not the case that's happening in many cities. The fact of the matter is, is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kickstart it, create that, create that base.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, as far as your campaign's position, the promise is to seize federal lands to build homes, remove regulation, provide tax breaks, and cut back on immigration, which you say pushes up prices. Where are you going to build all the new homes you're promising? And what part of any of this plan will provide immediate relief? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices. But we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country…\n\nTIM WALZ: Pass the bill.\n\nJD VANCE: …which does drive up costs, Tim. Twenty-five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It's why we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien, alien populations under Kamala Harris's leadership. Now, Tim just mentioned a bunch of ideas. Now, some of those ideas I actually think are halfway decent, and some of them I disagree with. But the most important thing here is Kamala Harris is not running as a newcomer to politics. She is the sitting Vice President. If she wants to enact all of these policies to make housing more affordable, I invite her to use the office that the American people already gave her, not sit around and campaign and do nothing while Americans find the American Dream of home ownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked Margaret what would immediately change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices. As Donald Trump says, “Drill, baby, drill.” One of the biggest drivers of housing costs, aside from illegal immigration, is think about it: if a truck driver is paying 40% more for diesel, then the lumber he's delivering to the job site to build the house is also going to become a lot more expensive. If we open up American energy, you will get immediate pricing release, relief, for American citizens, not, by the way, just in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods too.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, you still have 23 seconds there. Do you want to answer?\n\nTIM WALZ: Can I have it?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where, Governor, we will get to you in a moment. But, Senator, where are you going to seize the federal lands. Can you clarify?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, what Donald Trump has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything. They're not being used for national parks. They're not being used. And they could be places where we build a lot of housing. And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country. We have a lot of land that could be used. We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the Vice President is letting in migrants\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, of course, that's not true. And again, you have the facts. I guess we agreed not to fact check. I'll check it. That, look, crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. But it's, again, blaming and not trying to find the solution. I was going to ask, though, on this question, are we going to drill and build houses in the same federal land. And I think when people hear federal lands, these are really important pieces of land. Now, Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands. I know in the western part of the countries we do. There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example. So the issue is, I don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this. And I worry about this as someone who cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands. Look, Minnesota, we protect these things. We've got about 20% of the world's fresh water. These lands protect. They're there for a reason. They belong to all of us. But again, this is when you view housing and you view these things as commodities, like there's a chance to make money here. Let's take this federal land and let's sell it to people for that. I think there's better ways to do this. We've seen it in Minnesota. We're able to refurbish some of these houses. We're able to make some investments, that gets people in. And I'm still on the fact, on this, economist, Senator Vance, you said you don't like the economist, which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the cost.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, governor, your time is, your time is up.\n\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, there's a Federal Reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate. We'll put it up on social media. Actually, that really drills down on the connection between increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration, and higher housing prices. Now, of course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices. It's also the regulatory regime of Kamala Harris. Look, we are a country of builders. We're a country of doers. We're a country of explorers. But we increasingly have a Federal administration that makes it harder to develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says that they have to do. And what that means is that you have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes. I actually agree with Tim Walz. We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity. But the thing that has most turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be here.\n\nTIM WALZ: What are the federal regulations? I deal with this as a Governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can very quickly reply.\n\nTIM WALZ: I'm sorry. I get this as a Governor, and I don't necessarily disagree with that, that in some cases, many of those are local, many of them are state. I don't know which ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them. I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire. I think you want to make sure that it's fireproof and those types of things. So which are the regulations? Because the vice president's not responsible for those. Congress writes those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you, gentlemen. We have a lot to get through. You're passionate about the housing crisis. I can tell. But Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care. Senator Vance, at the last Presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing the Affordable Care act. In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan. Since then, Senator, you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance. Can you explain how that would work? And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions won't pay more? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care, I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least, for the first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time, under Donald Trump's leadership. And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this “concepts of a plan” remark. I think it's very simple common sense. I think, as Tim Walz knows from twelve years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900 page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of bipartisan negotiation. Now, when Donald Trump was actually President, and again, he has a record to be proud of, prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time. Under Kamala Harris's leadership, prescription drugs are up about 7%. Under Donald Trump's entire four years, they were up about one and a half percent. He introduced pricing transparency. Think about healthcare. You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs. That price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also drive down costs. And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking about. Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non chronically ill. It's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along. I think this is an important point about President Trump. Of course, you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done, but when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and healthcare costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care. It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more that we can do. But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies. He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor.\n\nTIM WALZ: All right, here's where being an old guy gives you some history. I was there at the creation of the ACA, and the reason it was so important is I come from a major healthcare state, home of the Mayo Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those. We understand healthcare. It's why we're ranked first on affordability and accessibility and quality of health care. And so what I know is under Kamala Harris, more people are covered than they have before. Those of you listening, this is critical to you. Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants you… go back and remember this. He ran on, the first thing he was going to do on day one, was to repeal Obamacare. On day one, he tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA. He signed onto a lawsuit to repeal the ACA, but lost at the Supreme Court. And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill. Now fast forward. What that means to you is you lose your pre-existing conditions if you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad. If you're a woman, probably not. Broke your foot during football, might kick you out. Your kids get kicked out when they're 26. Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare. We have ten drugs that will come online, the most common ones that'll be there. But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, “I've got a concept of a plan,” it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have never given me that. But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept, because what he explained is pre-Obamacare. And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have done this for a long time. What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more? So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure. Because guess what happens? You pay your premium. It's not much. They figure they're not going to have to pay out to you. But those of you a little older, gray, you know, got cancer? You're going to get kicked out of it. That's why the system didn't work. Kamala Harris will protect and enhance the ACA.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, thank you. Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions, or laid out that plan.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations in place, in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better. Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true. A lot of what happened and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy people were leaving the exchanges. Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had preexisting conditions. But again, something that these guys do, is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes President, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue. But in reality, Donald Trump was President. Inflation was low, take home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. He did his job, which is govern in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about problems, but actually solve them.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up under the Trump Administration?\n\nTIM WALZ: It's higher now that we've seen it go up. Look, people are using it. The system works. And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual mandate piece of this. And Republicans fought tooth and nail, saying, well, Americans should be free to do this. Well, then what happens?\n\nJD VANCE: You think the individual mandate's a good idea?\n\nTIM WALZ: I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone, that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn’t, it collapses. You are asking pre-ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on healthcare. People expect it to be there. And when we are able to make it, and we are making it this way, when we incentivize people to be in the market, when we help people who might not be able to afford it get there, and we make sure then when you get sick and old, it's there for you. Because I heard people say, well, I don't want to buy into Medicare or whatever. Good luck buying healthcare once you get past 70. So look, the ACA works. We can continue to do better. Kamala Harris did that. The way she made everything better was negotiating those ten drugs on Medicare for the first time in American history.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. Margaret?\n\nJD VANCE: Can I address that?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: We’re, I apologize. We're out of time. We have a number of subjects to discuss. Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about families in America. There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents. Governor Walz, you said that if Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you. How long should employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, that's negotiable. And that's what Congress worked. But here's what the deal is. Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company. Look, we're home in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Kamala Harris knows that in California. Those companies provide paid family medical leave. One is, I think they're moral and they think it's a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy. We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave. You have a child. You, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born. This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time. What we know is that gets the child off to a better start. The family works better. We stay in their employers. We get more consistency in that. So Kamala Harris has made it a priority. We implemented it in Minnesota, and we see growth. That's how you become a pro-business state. But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, those big companies are able to offer it. Those of you out there who don't have it, just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick. We know what happens. You end up staying home. In some places, that means no paycheck, because you've got no protection on that. This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us. He's willing to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest, he's willing to say, “Bust those unions up. Do whatever.” What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us. And so a paid family medical leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them. As far as childcare on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side. You can't expect the most important people in our lives to take care of our children or our parents, to get paid the least amount of money. And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that. We were able to do it in Minnesota, and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state. We're still in crisis on this. A Federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, do you support a national paid leave program? And if so, for how long should employers be mandated to pay their employees while they are home taking care of their newborn? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, too, have worked on this issue, and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us care about this issue. I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her. But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult. And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective. She actually had access to paid family leave because she worked for a bigger company. But the cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want. A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately. Some would like to spend a little time home with the kids. Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids. We should have a family care model that makes choice possible. And I think this is a very important substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’s approach. I mean, look, if you look at the Federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the community development block grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money from the federal government. These programs only go to one kind of childcare model. Let's say you'd like your church, maybe, to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide childcare in the way that makes the most sense. You don't get access to any of these federal monies. We want to promote choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote childcare because, look, it is unacceptable. And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight weeks. And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids. That is an incredible burden to put on American families. We're the only country that does it. I think we could do a heck of a lot better.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you. You have also said, Senator Vance, many things about the American family. The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on childcare as they do on housing each month. So I want to get your thoughts on this. President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in. Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. Cut taxes for American workers and American families. Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of America. But penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. That's the heart of the economic proposal. And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, childcare options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify how that will solve the childcare shortage?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don't have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options. And we're going to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money. We're going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing this very essential service.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, your ticket also has some childcare tax credit proposals. Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and $3,000 credit for children over the age of six, as your campaign has promised? Is that realistic?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and this is the biggest issue everybody listening tonight knows. I mean, I'm sure they were shocked to hear it's not that expensive. And let's be clear whether it's $5000 or $6000, that pays you about three or four months. Let's be clear of where we're at on this. It's because we got out of an imbalance on this. We thought we were going to get by by not paying people. I don't think Senator Vance and I are that far apart. I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options. We've done scholarships, types of things. I think we need to be open to making the case. But the issue here is, the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs. That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less. So not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole. That's Wharton School. That's his alma mater. And so I think the issue here is those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not here. When I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometimes. But they will lead with childcare and they will lead with housing, because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you. We need to move on. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Let's talk about the State of Democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy and inflation. After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results. Judges, including those appointed by President Trump and other Republican Presidents looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread fraud. The Governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th. Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last Presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors. That has been called unconstitutional and illegal. Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every Governor certifies the results? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I think that we're focused on the future. We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris's policies. Make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're focused on. But I want to answer your question because you did ask it. Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020. And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square. And that's all I've said. And that's all that Donald Trump has said. Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the President. Donald Trump left the White House. And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration. I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens. And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation. I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years. Now I’m really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong leaders in the democratic coalition. And of course, they don't agree with me and Donald Trump on every issue. We don't have to agree on every issue, but we're united behind a basic American First Amendment principle that we ought to debate our differences. We ought to argue about them. We ought to try to persuade our fellow Americans. Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale. She did it during COVID, she's done it over a number of other issues. And that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January 6th.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here. And I'm sympathetic to misspeaking on things. And I think I might have with the Senator, but…\n\nJD VANCE: Me too, man.\n\nTIM WALZ: There's one, there's one, thou", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/us/rapper-deaths-gun-violence-reaj", "title": "Gun violence has killed at least 1 rapper every year since 2018 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s happened again: America wakes up to news that a hip-hop star was fatally and senselessly shot. This time, the rapper is Takeoff of Atlanta’s platinum hit machine, Migos, who was slain early Tuesday in Houston, according to a source close to the group.\n\nHouston police responded to the scene of a downtown shooting at a bowling alley and pool hall, finding one person dead, the department said. Two other victims were taken in private vehicles to hospitals.\n\nTakeoff’s death is the latest in a trend that stretches back to 2018. Each year since then, gun violence – whether through robbery or disagreement – has killed at least one rapper who was either already famous or on the cusp of crossover fame.\n\nThe 28-year-old rhymesmith, who was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, had just released a project with his uncle and Migos bandmate, Quavo, titled, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” the album’s name a shoutout to the 1995 debut solo effort from Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon. Quavo and Takeoff had recently announced they’d be performing under the moniker, “Unc & Phew.”\n\nHours before he was killed, Takeoff tweeted the video to the single, “Messy,” off the project. On the track, Takeoff rhymes, “Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever/Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain’t gonna tell ‘em.” On Friday, he tweeted about performing in Miami.\n\nLast month, he and Quavo appeared on the podcast, “Drink Champs,” and in response to praise for his lyricism on “Infinity Links,” Takeoff told listeners, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”\n\nIn addition to his work with Quavo and Migos, Takeoff released a solo album in 2018, “The Last Rocket,” which hit No. 4 on the US charts.\n\nFrom left, Takeoff, DJ Mustard and Quavo perform at the BET Awards in Los Angeles in 2019. Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nNews of Takeoff’s killing rocked hip-hop, but his loss is being felt well beyond the bounds of music as many chimed in to offer condolences and praise, while others questioned what needs to be done to stop the scourge of rappers being killed.\n\n“Too many young men of color are killing each other,” tweeted Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. “Resolving their disputes by pulling their guns and shooting one another regardless of fame or fortune. Crazy. And in a few second a life is gone, families and friends are left grieving. STOP!”\n\nJournalist Jewel Wicker offered some additional career insight from an interview with Takeoff’s uncle, writing, “Takeoff, the then-kid who convinced his uncle (Quavo) to start rapping then helped change the flow of rap. The undisputed best rapper in Migos (his uncle told me so himself just a few months ago). What a loss.” She further reported Takeoff earned his stage name from his ability to “just launch into his verses and record everything in a single, pristine take.”\n\nFellow writer Jemele Hill added, “I was in college when Biggie and ‘Pac were killed and thought there was no way we’d ever experience anything remotely close to that again. Now it’s happening so frequently that you barely have time to recover before someone else killed. RIP Takeoff.”\n\nRapper Ja Rule felt similarly, writing, “this s**t has to STOP,” while fellow rap star, Lecrae, wrote, “No hot takes. No profound thoughts. Just sad that another rapper, son, brother, and friend has been killed. God be with all those who feel the loss.”\n\nRolling Stone Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman tweeted out a 2015 article in which Takeoff spoke of his dedication to his craft.\n\n“You couldn’t tell me I wasn’t going to be who I was,” he said. “I knew I was going to be here.”\n\nTakeoff now joins the list of rappers who were victims of gun violence. Here are some other notable artists killed since 2018:\n\n2018: XXXTentacion\n\nXXXTentacion, seen here in 2017, found fame after going viral on social media. Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock\n\nXXXTentacion was gunned down June 18, 2018, in an apparent robbery as he left a motorsports store in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\nFour men were arrested that year in connection with the rapper’s killing. They were indicted on murder and other charges, and one suspect pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is expected to testify against the other three, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.\n\nThe 20-year-old was wildly popular at the time of his death. He rocketed to fame after his song, “Look at Me,” went viral on social media and SoundCloud in 2016.\n\nHe went on to be featured in XXL magazine’s 2017 Freshman Class alongside other up-and-coming artists. His album “?” premiered at No. 1 when it was released in March 2018, according to Billboard.\n\nThe album’s single “Sad!” peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks on the charts, according to Billboard.\n\nRight after his death, “Sad!” moved from No. 52 to No. 1 on Billboard ‘s Hot 100 chart. The song was the first posthumous No. 1 for a lead soloist since The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” in 1997, according to Billboard.\n\nThe rapper was not without controversy: He was accused of homophobia after telling a story on a podcast of choking and severely beating a cellmate he suspected was gay while they both were housed in a juvenile detention center. He had also been awaiting trial for a domestic violence incident involving his pregnant girlfriend.\n\n2019: Nipsey Hussle\n\nNipsey Hussle was fatally shot in March 2019 near a clothing store he owned.

Holder, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the rapper’s death. According to numerous hip-hop publications, his September sentencing date was postponed to this month.\n\nNipsey had been well-known on the underground circuit, and he was gaining a mainstream following just before his death.\n\nA year earlier, he launched the first Marathon Clothing smart store in Los Angeles.

Mo Brooks of Alabama against a civil lawsuit that claims he helped to incite the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol. In a court filing Tuesday, the Justice Department urged a judge to deny the congressman’s request for immunity as a federal employee over his remarks at a pro-Donald Trump rally that occurred before the rioting at the .Capitol. Brooks had argued that he was acting within the scope of his office when he spoke at a rally Jan. 6 and thus was due the legal protections afforded federal employees and members of Congress who are facing civil lawsuits over their jobs. The Justice Department said the event was campaign-related and it would not certify that Brooks was acting in his official capacity. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, who served as a House manager in Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, filed a lawsuit in March against the former president and others, including Brooks, whose actions he charges led to the events.\n\nAlaska\n\nPerryville: A powerful earthquake that struck just off Alaska’s southern coast caused prolonged shaking and prompted tsunami warnings that sent people scrambling for shelters. Residents reported only minor damage, but officials said that could change after sunrise and people get a better look. The National Tsunami Warning Center canceled the warnings early Thursday when the biggest wave, of just over a half-foot, was recorded in Old Harbor. A tsunami warning that had also been issued for Hawaii was also canceled, and officials said there was no threat to Guam, American Samoa or the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. The warning for Alaska covered nearly a 1,000-mile stretch from Prince William Sound to Samalga Island, near the end of the Aleutian Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was magnitude 8.2 and hit 56 miles east southeast of Perryville at about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday. The quake was about 29 below the surface of the ocean according to USGS. Several other earthquakes, some with with preliminary magnitudes of 6.2 and 5.6, occurred in the same area within hours of the first one, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Drought conditions still exist across Arizona but recent monsoon rain has had a significant impact for the better. The latest drought monitor “shows substantial improvement” in the two most severe drought categories, now reporting 52% of Arizona in either extreme or exceptional drought, down from 84% last week, the National Weather Service office in Phoenix said Thursday. The month isn’t even over yet and Tucson has recorded its wettest July in the city’s history. The southern Arizona city received 7.08 inches of rain as of Wednesday, according to the National weather service. That breaks the previous July record of 6.8 inches set in 2017. Because of an active monsoon season, Tucson has been hit with more than 5 inches of rain since last July 23. Meteorologists said the normal rainfall amount for Tucson in July is about 2 inches. Meanwhile, Phoenix has received 1.67 inches of rain this month, its wettest July since 2013.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas Board of Trustees approved a plan to keep a statue of the late Democratic Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus, despite calls to remove it because of his support of segregation. The board approved a resolution that called for keeping the statue at its location on the Fayetteville campus, but with “contextualization” about Fulbright’s legacy. The resolution cited a new Arkansas law that prohibits removing or relocating monuments without state approval. The resolution approved also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’s college of arts and sciences. Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Jose Sanchez Villalobos, the architect of a subterranean tunnel that shuttled tons of marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. for drug cartel Sinaola under Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, was sentenced in San Diego federal court to 10 years and one month in custody for a drug-distribution conspiracy – just over the 10-year minimum mandatory sentence. Villalobos’ tunnel linked a Tijuana warehouse to another in Otay Mesa and was equipped with a hydraulic elevator, electric rail cars, lighting, wooden floors and a storeroom. It was a feat of engineering that U.S. authorities would later marvel at as the “most elaborate smuggling tunnel” to be uncovered along the U.S.-Mexico border at the time. In a plea agreement in December, Sanchez admitted to planning, financing and supervising the construction of “multiple” cross-border tunnels from 2010 to 2012, as well as overseeing their operation as smuggling conduits. Sanchez, 58, has already served most of his prison term. Since his arrest in Mexico in 2012, he has spent about eight years in custody there and another year and a half in San Diego after being extradited to face charges in the U.S. With good behavior credits, he is likely due to be released within a few months.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Boulder County has suspended consideration of a permit needed for a long-sought reservoir expansion by Denver Water until a federal court hears a lawsuit filed by the utility that alleged the county is stalling on the permit and jeopardizing the project. The county on Tuesday said it had agreed to a Denver Water request to put the process on hold pending the outcome of the suit, which Denver Water filed in U.S. District Court on July 14. It canceled public hearings on the project set for August and September. Denver Water contended it has made good-faith efforts over several years on a local-use land review needed to begin work on Gross Reservoir. It alleged the county has used the process to delay the review, jeopardizing federal and other deadlines for the project. In June, county planning and permitting staff determined that Denver Water hadn’t provided satisfactory answers to requests for information on the project. The Gross Reservoir Expansion Project would be the largest construction project in the history of Boulder County. It would raise the 340-foot Gross Dam by an additional 131 feet, increasing reservoir capacity by 77,000 acre-feet. Environmentalists and many local residents argued it will cause serious impacts to the environment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal appeals court overturned a lower court order issued last year that required Connecticut to resume fingerprinting for gun permit applicants despite the state’s suspension of those services because of the coronavirus pandemic. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York vacated the preliminary injunction on technical grounds. The judges also noted local police resumed fingerprinting shortly before the June 2020 preliminary injunction was issued, and state police resumed the services shortly after it was issued. The Connecticut Citizens Defense League and six people seeking gun permits sued Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, the state’s public safety commissioner and local police chiefs in federal court in New Haven, saying the suspension of fingerprinting services violated their Second Amendment gun rights. Judge Jeffrey Meyer agreed and issued the injunction requiring fingerprinting to resume. The appeals court judges said the six plaintiffs’ claims were moot because fingerprinting resumed, and the defense league did not have legal standing to be a part of the case.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The city is granting some parking violators amnesty as it returns to normal operations. The city issued about 1,800 tickets on Monday and Tuesday to residents for failing to update their parking permits or move their cars for street cleaning, Mayor Mike Purzycki said in a news release. The city announced last week that enforcement suspended because of the pandemic would resume, but because so many people were ticketed, the mayor said the city will offer limited ticket amnesty this week only. Tickets issued for these violations between Monday and Friday will be converted to warnings and anyone who has paid will get a refund, Purzycki said, but “ticketing will resume as normal” starting Monday. The amnesty does not apply to metered parking tickets or any other parking enforcement violation. City officials are reminding residents that other city services that have resumed include ticketing, booting and towing of vehicles for traffic and parking violations and for delinquent fines and fees, water utility service disconnections for delinquencies and sheriff sales.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The White House Historical Association unveiled three new historical markers at the northern end of Lafayette Park – less than a block from the White House. The three large horizontal tablets have illustrations and text that address different issues. One focuses on the construction of the White House, with an emphasis on the fact that enslaved people and paid laborers took part. The second focuses on former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who founded the association in 1961. The third addresses Lafayette Park’s history as a center for public protests, dating to 1917 and continuing through last summer’s protests over police brutality and racial injustice. The intersection of 16th and H streets in front of the markers was officially named Black Lives Matter Plaza by the city government last year. Stewart McLaurin, the president of the association, credited former first lady Michelle. Obama with unintentionally jump-starting the project. As first lady, she publicly spoke multiple times of her intense awareness that she woke up every morning in a house built by enslaved people. The White House Historical Association is a nonprofit donor-supported group that helps maintain many of the White House’s interior furnishings. It also funds the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Florida man was discovered inside a giant floating contraption shaped like a hamster wheel on a beach, according to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office. The agency said the “driver” Reza Baluchi was not injured. The 49-year-old told authorities he was attempting to raise money for charity by “running” on water from St. Augustine to New York City by way of Bermuda, but ran into some problems. Baluchi and his hydropod, as he calls it, washed ashore near Hammock, in Flagler County, about 30 miles from where he first started the endeavor in St. Johns County. Flagler County deputies said they arrived at the beach after several alarmed callers reported seeing the UFO, unidentified floating object. The hydropod is basically a metal cylinder with paddle wheels. The long-distance runner told authorities he “came across some complications that brought him back to shore.” The money Baluchi was trying to raise was to go to first responders, the kind that just got him out of his latest situation. The vessel is reportedly outfitted with GPS and enough food and water for days. This is hardly the adventurer’s first brush with disaster: Baluchi made his first failed attempt in 2014, trying to get to travel north, before having to be rescued in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at a cost of $144,000 to taxpayers. His second attempt two years later also failed when he was stopped by the Coast Guard for safety reasons.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia is asking a judge to toss out a Department of Justice lawsuit challenging the state’s sweeping new election law. In a motion to dismiss filed Wednesday in federal court in Atlanta, attorneys for the state called the lawsuit “a politicized intrusion” into the state’s constitutional authority to regulate its elections. The state’s election laws “are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and well within the mainstream of election laws across the country,” they wrote. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the lawsuit last month, saying that Republican state lawmakers in Georgia had rushed the election overhaul through with an intent to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot. The move by the Biden administration came two weeks after Garland said his department would look closely at Republican-led efforts to tighten state voting rules. He said the federal government would act if prosecutors found unlawful activity. The U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta declined to comment on the motion to dismiss.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on the nomination of Daniel Gluck, the executive director of the Hawaii Ethics Commission, to serve on the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Critics have questioned Gov. David Ige’s choice of Gluck, a white man, for the job, noting it has been 30 years since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the appeals court and 20 since a Native Hawaiian was appointed to the Supreme Court. Others have questioned his legal experience given he hasn’t brought as many cases to trial as other potential nominees put forward by the state Judicial Selection Commission. The committee didn’t vote on the nomination. Judiciary Committee Chairman Karl Rhoads said the committee would vote on Wednesday. Gluck’s supporters noted his keen legal mind, his dedication to social justice and his fairness.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise said a Boeing 737 from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service in Australia arrived at the center last weekend to help fight wildfires. The jet is being made available through an agreement between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Australia. The airtanker has two internal tanks with a capacity of 4,000 gallons. The aircraft is named Marie Bashir after Dame Marie Bashir, a former governor of New South Wales. “We greatly appreciate having this airtanker from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service assisting us,” said Kim Christensen, deputy assistant director for operations for the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re proud of the long history of cooperation we have with Australia and other countries.” The center moved to national preparedness level 5 earlier this month. That’s the highest level and means firefighting resources are stretched thin because of multiple large wildfires burning in the West. The center said that on Thursday there are 82 large, active fires in 13 states that have burned 2,600 square miles. More than 21,500 firefighters and support personnel are mobilized to fight the wildfires. So far this year, wildfires have burned more than 5,300 square miles.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Severe thunderstorms swept through the Chicago area and northern Illinois early Thursday with high winds that left thousands of homes and businesses without power. The National Weather Service said several areas recorded wind gusts in excess of 60 mph that knocked down tree limbs or toppled whole trees, damaging some power lines. Weather observers recorded a 64 mph wind gust at the DuPage Airport in DuPage County about 3 a.m., and the Chicago Executive Airport in Cook County had a 55 mph wind gust. ComEd reported that more than 24,000 of its customers remained without power at about 7:20 a.m. The Illinois Department of Transportation said some trees were toppled in Waukegan just before 4 a.m., as the storms pushed across the area. The National Weather Service said “life-threatening” swim conditions were expected Thursday on Lake Michigan as a cold front moved its way through the area, bringing cooler, less humid air. According to a beach hazard statement, waves of 4 to 7 feet and rip currents are expected along the lake in Cook County and in northwestern Indiana’s Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties until Friday night.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington:Indiana University and the city of Bloomington plan to rename Jordan Avenue after local residents who rose to prominence after escaping slavery. A task force is recommending the city-owned section from East Davis Street to 17th Street be named Eagleson Avenue, and the university-owned section, from East 17th Street to Fee Lane, be named Fuller Lane or Mattie Fuller Lane. The city said in a news release its portion of the street would be named after the Eagleson family, whose members for four generations made significant contributions to the city, university, state and nation, starting with Halson Vashon Eagleson, who was born into slavery in 1851 and came to Bloomington in the 1880s. The university’s portion would be named after Mattie Jacobs Fuller, who was born into slavery in 1856 but lived in Bloomington from age 4 until her death in 1940. The news release said she was a successful businesswoman and suffragist and made the donation that founded Bethel AME Church.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An influential hog dealer sanctioned twice for defrauding pork producers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars said it has fired employees responsible for its latest violations and paid restitution to affected sellers. Lynch Livestock, based in Waucoma, also announced that pork industry veteran Dan Sutherland would lead the company going forward “as a further safeguard against future violations,” citing Sutherland’s experience in compliance matters. Lynch announced those moves in a press release posted online Wednesday, after the Associated Press reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had taken enforcement action against the company for illegal buying practices for the second time since 2017. The company’s longtime owner, Gary Lynch, a top booster of Iowa State athletics and political donor to Iowa Republican elected officials, hasn’t returned messages seeking comment. In the press release, his company said the USDA received a complaint in January that employees at its Waucoma buying station were manipulating the scale and issuing false tickets to artificially lower payments to producers. Lynch said it investigated the allegations and terminated an unspecified number of employees who engaged in those practices. The USDA has not revoked Lynch’s dealer license and praised the company in a press release last week for its cooperation and voluntary corrective actions. The company operates 39 buying stations across eight Midwestern states, and markets hogs to major packing plants across the country.\n\nKansas\n\nLeawood: A Leawood physician has surrendered his medical license after admitting that he told a drug company he would not sell one of their products unless he was hired for more speaking engagements. Dr. Steven M. Simon gave up his medical license this month after being sentenced in April to three years of probation for soliciting health care kickbacks, KCUR reported. Simon was also ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Simon, a pain doctor, admitted in January that he told a representative for AstraZeneca that he would not continue to prescribe Movantik, which is used to treat constipation caused by opioid medications, unless he was paid for more speaking engagements. The company then determined it would no longer hire Simon as a speaker, according to his plea. Doctors can legally accept meals, speaking fees and other compensation from drug and medical device companies but cannot receive kickbacks for prescribing drugs or medical devices. Simon has also been sued by patients who claimed he prescribed them fentanyl spray because its manufacturer, Insys Therapeutics, was paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: A ferry that carries vehicles across the Mississippi River between Kentucky and Missouri is reopening after a one-day closure for engine maintenance, officials said. The work was completed earlier than expected, allowing the Dorena-Hickman Ferry to reopen Thursday morning, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. Capt. Jeremy Newsom had anticipated the closure to last for a few days. The ferry connects Kentucky 1354 at Hickman, Kentucky, with Missouri Route A and Route 77 near Dorena, Missouri. It is the only direct route between the states.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A judge is allowing some of those being sentenced to probation in his court to get a COVID-19 vaccination to reduce their community service requirement. Judge Fred Crifasi in Baton Rouge said vaccination is not mandated but offered as an option. “Getting vaccinated is a service to the community,” Crifasi said Thursday in an emailed statement to the Associated Press. “We are currently in a serious predicament in Louisiana. So, if a probation candidate is inclined to get vaccinated, I will grant credit for that effort towards any requirement of community service. The amount of hours varies and depends on the person’s circumstances. It is not a mandate. If a person is not inclined, they do not have to do it.” Crifasi’s probation option is being offered as coronavirus infections across the state are skyrocketing. The state health department reported 4,413 new COVID-19 cases Thursday and the daily hospitalization number was 1,620, nearly 100 more than a day earlier. It had been below 300 for much of May and all of June. Louisiana has been among the states with the lowest overall vaccination rate.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine church that sued over coronavirus restrictions last year is taking a preemptive legal strike against future restrictions associated with a variant of the virus that’s spreading across the country. Calvary Chapel in Orrington is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Democratic Gov. Janet Mills from enforcing or reinstating any pandemic-related restrictions because of the delta variant. The state responded by noting that the governor’s civil emergency already expired, making the lawsuit unnecessary. “For more than two months, there have been no restrictions whatsoever on the size of gatherings, and the state of emergency expired at the end of June. Given that, we are disappointed that Calvary Chapel continues to waste public and judicial resources by attempting to litigate an issue that is now moot,” said Marc Malon, spokesperson for the state attorney general’s office. But church officials are worried that restrictions could be reinstated. Describing Mills’ previous restrictions as a 14-month “reign of terror,” church officials claimed in their request for a preemptive injunction that any restrictions would violate their religious liberties protected by the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has heard similar requests on behalf of religious organizations and lifted limits in California.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:Peter Schultz, aboard the boat the Reel One, caught a 301-pound swordfish at the Big Fish Classic Tournament on July 23, setting a state record. Schultz became the first officially recognized record-holder for swordfish, according to the Maryland Department of National Resources. The DNR maintains state records for four divisions of fish: Atlantic, Chesapeake, Nontidal and Invasive. Until Schultz, the swordfish category within the Atlantic division was vacant in the record books, with no one claiming that spot in state history. Schultz called the catch \"the fish of a lifetime,\" according to a news release from the Department of National Resources. Schultz, an Annapolis resident, was about 50 miles offshore at Washington Canyon when he made the catch. It took Schultz and his team 8 hours to bring in the fish.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreenfield: Magician Penn Jillette is urging people to support a fundraising effort by the agricultural fair in his Massachusetts hometown he credits with inspiring his show business career. Jillette said he saw his first fire eater and his first freak show at the Franklin County Fair in Greenfield and spent some of the “happiest times of my life” there. He made the comments in a nearly 4-minute video posted on the fair’s Facebook page Wednesday. He even participated in the demolition derby one year. “I can trace my whole career back to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and the Franklin County Fair,” the talking half of the Penn & Teller comedy/magic team, said in the video. The fair, run by the Franklin County Agricultural Society, is still trying raise about $90,000 toward its $260,000 goal so it can fix erosion damage at the fairgrounds and make other improvements. Fair President Michael Nelson told Masslive.com that he emailed Jillette’s representatives asking for help, and got a response from Jillette about an hour later. The fair was canceled in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, but is scheduled for Sept. 9-12 this year. The fair is “America at its best,” Jillette, who lives in Las Vegas, said in the video.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:City Council member Andre Spivey has been charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and accused of accepting $1,000 from an undercover law enforcement agent. Spivey was named late Tuesday in an indictment filed in federal court in Detroit. The bribe allegedly was accepted on Oct. 26, 2018, according to the indictment which also said that between 2016 and 2020, Spivey and “public official A” accepted more than $35,000 in payments to influence votes “concerning an industry under review by the council.” Public official A is identified in the indictment as a member of Spivey’s staff. Elliott Hall, an attorney for Spivey, said the indictment was expected. Hall said Spivey did nothing in return for the money and had been cooperating with the U.S. Attorney’s office for more than a year. The Associated Press left voicemails Wednesday seeking comment from Hall and Spivey on the indictment. Spivey represents the city’s District 4 and first was elected in 2009. He did not file for reelection and is not on the ballot for the city’s Aug. 3 primary.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRed Lake: A man was charged Wednesday in the killing of a Red Lake Nation police officer who was fatally shot while responding to a call to a residence on the tribe’s reservation in northwestern Minnesota. David Donnell Jr., 28, of Redby was charged in federal court with one count of second-degree murder and four counts of assault with a dangerous weapon in the death of Officer Ryan Bialke. Bialke, 37, was killed Tuesday after he went to Donnell’s home on a report of a suicidal male with children possibly in the residence, according to the Red Lake Department of Public Safety. Federal authorities said Donnell was standing on the porch when officers arrived, then went inside the house. Because Donnell refused to comply with orders from the officers and had an active warrant, police broke down the front door, Department of Justice officials said. That’s when Donnell began firing. Bialke was struck by gunfire and died at the scene, officials said. Donnell fled and was taken into custody at a nearby residence a short time later, authorities said. Court documents do not list an attorney for Donnell. The tribe said Bialke was a six-year veteran of the Red Lake Police Department. He is survived by his wife and four children.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: Cases of COVID-19 are surging in Mississippi, but Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said a federal recommendation for people to wear masks indoors is “foolish.” “It has nothing to do with science,” Reeves said during a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, according to WAPT-TV Mississippi has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the nation, and Reeves on Thursday encouraged people to get vaccinated. He went on camera to get his own vaccination early this year. But during his outdoor speech at the fair, Reeves repeated what his office had said earlier this week – he will not set a mask mandate for schools. Some Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others will begin by mid-August. “I don’t think you’re going to see any school district mandate masks in schools,” Reeves said at the fair, according to WJTV-TV. “I think if you start seeing them do that, the parents will erupt, and they should, and I feel certain they will.” Some Mississippi school districts have mask mandates for the new academic year, but others said wearing a mask is optional. Last week, the state Health Department recommended masks be worn indoors in school settings by all unvaccinated people 2 and older.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis County Health Director Dr. Faisal Khan said he was called racial slurs and physically assaulted after defending a new mask mandate to fight COVID-19. Khan said in response, he raised his middle finger at a crowd gathered at a St. Louis County Council meeting, according to a Wednesday letter obtained by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “After being physically assaulted, called racial slurs and surrounded by an angry mob, I expressed my displeasure by using my middle finger toward an individual who had physically threatened me and called me racist slurs,” Khan wrote to the councilwoman who led the meeting. The St. Louis County Council voted 5-2 on Tuesday to end the county’s mask mandate, saying the county executive did not consult with them before issuing it. County Executive Sam Page has insisted the mask mandate is still in effect, despite the vote. Orders took effect Monday there and in the city of St. Louis, requiring everyone age 5 or older to wear masks inside public spaces and on public transportation even if they are vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A prosecutor for the Crow Tribe accused a federal law enforcement officer of assault, criminal endangerment and negligent endangerment after the officer’s police dog allegedly caused extensive injuries to a suspect during a traffic stop. A civil complaint from prosecutor David Sibley seeks to ban Bureau of Indian Affairs officer Steve Stallings from the Crow reservation in southeastern Montana over the July 20 incident. Sibley said Thursday he filed the complaint a day earlier in Crow Nation Tribal Court, but did not know when Stallings would be officially served with the suit. Stallings was the handler for a dog that latched onto the leg of tribal member Harris Redstar following a traffic stop in Lodge Grass, according to the complaint. The dog continued to hold Redstar’s leg in its jaws even after he was on the ground and in handcuffs, causing extensive injuries that required Redstar to be hospitalized, the prosecutor said. Redstar had been in a confrontation with a second officer before Stallings’ arrival. He faces charges of resisting, obstructing and assaulting an officer and is due to make an initial court appearance next month, Sibley said. Stallings could not be reached for comment. A bureau spokesperson did not have an immediate response to the allegations.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Police arrested a 31-year-old man who jumped the fence surrounding the Governor’s Mansion in Lincoln and sat down in the backyard, according to the Nebraska State Patrol. The incident happened Wednesday afternoon, when Gov. Pete Ricketts was not in the mansion, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. The patrol said State Capitol security spotted the man as he scaled the fence and entered the back yard. He was quickly arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance, trespassing and criminal impersonation because police said he gave officers a fake name.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada casinos rode a robust economic rebound from coronavirus restrictions in June, taking in more than $1 billion in winnings for the fourth straight month and nearly reaching a record set a month earlier, state regulators reported Thursday. But a spike in COVID-19 cases since mid-May – and the restoration of indoor mask mandates for vaccinated and unvaccinated people beginning Friday – could cloud the July outlook for an economy heavily reliant on tourism and gambling. The Nevada Gaming Control Board said casinos reported house winnings of $1.19 billion statewide during the month. That was more than double the $567 million reported in June 2020, the first partial month of reopening after coronavirus pandemic casino closures, and topped the monthly casino win figure of $1.04 billion in June 2019. Board analyst Michael Lawton noted the last time casinos totaled billion-dollar winnings for four straight months was January to April 2008.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSalem: Gov. Chris Sununu signed three bills aimed at protecting not just canines but cats and wild critters, as well. Animal equity was the theme for two of the new laws: One will require drivers who injure or kill cats to notify police or the pets’ owners or else face a $1,000 fine, a mandate that has long existed for dogs. Another would expand the state’s animal cruelty laws and make it illegal to beat, whip, torture or mutilate any wild animal, fish or bird. The third bill, however, focuses squarely on dogs, making it a misdemeanor to maliciously remove a tracking collar or microchip from someone else’s dog. The bill, which also makes stealing a dog a felony for a second offense, was prompted by what supporters described as a growing problem of “dog flipping” in which people steal dogs to sell for profit. All three laws take effect Jan. 1.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCamden: A former teacher and child protective services worker who admitted to producing child pornography images of a young boy who was in his care has been sentenced to nearly 21 years in federal prison. Kayan Frazier, 29, of Somers Point will also have to pay his victim restitution under the 250-month sentence imposed Tuesday, although the amount has not yet been determined. He will also be on permanent supervised release once he’s freed from prison. Frazier had pleaded guilty in February to sexual exploitation of a child. Frazier was a substitute teacher for the Atlantic City School District between 2015 and 2017 before taking a job with the state Department of Child Protection and Permanency. The exploitation of the child occurred between March 2017 and April 2019, according to federal prosecutors. Authorities executed a search warrant at Frazier’s home in April 2019 after law enforcement officials learned that child porn images were being shared online by Frazier, prosecutors have said. He was at the home that day with the boy, and authorities have not said how long Frazier had been caring for the child. Authorities recovered thousands of images of child sexual abuse on Frazier’s cellphone and other electronic media, including images of the boy, which had been taken in Frazier’s apartment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The New Mexico Freedoms Alliance will be holding statewide protests against mask-wearing requirements in schools on Saturday. The group has been rallying to push the state to remove all requirements for mask-wearing and allow parents and students to decide whether they want to wear a mask. Last year, the New Mexico Public Education Department required all to mask up on school grounds to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. This year, the requirements are a bit complicated and largely in flux. On Monday, the Public Education Department issued a more relaxed mask-wearing policy, stating individuals in secondary schools do not need to wear masks if fully vaccinated. All students and staff in primary schools are still required to wear masks. Masks will not be required outside for anyone. The New Mexico Freedoms Alliance said masks have negatively impacted students by impeding their learning and causing headaches and other physical ailments. The protests will take place in about 15 cities across New Mexico. In Las Cruces, a protest will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Albert Johnson Park on the corner of Main Street and Picacho Avenue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Eight years after a judge ruled police violated the constitution by stopping, questioning and frisking mostly Black and Hispanic people on the street en masse, people in communities most affected by such tactics say they have been shut out of the legal process to end them. Attorneys for plaintiffs in two landmark stop-and-frisk lawsuits said in court papers Thursday that community stakeholders have had “very little contact” in the last three years with the court-appointed monitor overseeing reforms and that reports he has issued don’t reflect their experiences. They’re demanding greater input, including an advisory board comprised mostly of reform advocates and public housing residents, annual community surveys and biannual audits of NYPD stop-and-frisk and trespass enforcement activity – the results of which would then be summarized in public reports every six months.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville:State officials are for the second time in slightly more than a year trying to determine the source of potentially harmful compounds found in foam floating on a creek. In both instances, the man-made chemicals found in the Gray’s Creek area don’t appear to be connected to the Chemours plant, which is in the same area and makes a similar compound, The Fayetteville Observer reported. The state Department of Environmental Quality said in a memo dated June 22 that tests were conducted in March on foam from an unnamed tributary of Rockfish Creek. The tests showed that the foam contained perfluorooctane sulfonate, also known as PFOS, and three other compounds. In July 2020, department officials said tests on foam found floating in a creek revealed high levels of PFOS. This year’s memo noted that there are no federal or state health advisory levels for polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS compounds, in surface water or in foam. This year’s results showed PFOS levels at 614 parts per trillion, well above the 70 parts per trillion set for drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency The agency has found that PFOS can have harmful impacts on people’s health at certain levels. including cancer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Minnesota electric company that wants to sell its financially troubled coal-fueled power plant in North Dakota expects to know Friday if its member utility cooperatives will endorse the deal that includes purchasing electricity over the next decade from the factory’s prospective buyer. North Dakota officials have hailed the potential sale announced last month of Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station to Rainbow Energy Center as a savior for hundreds of jobs at the plant and an associated lignite coal mine that are about 50 miles north of Bismarck. North Dakota Republican Gov. Doug Burgum called the announcement a “huge sigh of relief” for the plant and mine, nearby communities and workers. But opponents believe the sale is delaying an inevitable closure, as coal continues to be eliminated from energy portfolios and regulations mount to curb the climate change effects of burning the fuel. The companies have not publicly disclosed terms of the deal, which includes an associated transmission line that runs more than 400 miles from central North Dakota to Minnesota.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: Amusement park operator Cedar Fair Entertainment said it plans to add esports to its lineup of roller coasters and water parks. It wants to build a 1,500-seat esports arena in Ohio for gaming tournaments near Cedar Point, its flagship amusement park in Sandusky, the company announced Thursday. The Ohio-based amusement park chain hopes to begin construction on the $28 million arena by the end of the year. The company said it believes it will be a draw for gamers across the Midwest. Plans call for the arena to have 200 gaming stations and host tournaments year-round beginning in the first half of 2023. It also could be used for concerts and other events, the company said. The building will have locker rooms, a food court and dormitory rooms for esports participants.The booming esports industry is especially popular among teens and youngers adults, which also is a target audience for the company’s 11 amusement parks and four separate water parks across the U.S.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of initial unemployment claims and the less volatile moving four-week average of initial claims are down in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission reported Thursday. The number of initial weekly claims fell by about 50%, from 7,787 to 4,394, and the moving average dropped from 8,237 to 7,046, the agency reported. “The decline is a promising indicator of the direction we’re heading,” said OESC director Shelly Zumwalt. “We are continuing to review applications for the Back-to-Work Initiative,” a $1,200 stipend offered to anyone returning to work for 32 or more hours per week for six consecutive weeks.The state’s latest unemployment rate of 3.7% in June was down from a high of 14.7% in April 2020 during a shutdown amid the coronavirus outbreak. The state health department reported 1,806 new virus cases and a seven-day average of 1,268 daily cases, compared to a seven-day average of 196 on June 25, as infections have increased with the highly contagious delta variant sweeping across the state.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city has banned homeless people from camping in forested parks both to protect them from potential wildfires and prevent them from accidentally starting blazes during a summer of drought and record-breaking heat. The City Council adopted the rule Wednesday for “high-risk hazard zones,” including in and around Portland’s famous Forest Park and in heavily forested wetlands and natural areas across the city. The ban will apply during wildfire season or whenever a county burn ban is in effect. The 8-square-mile Forest Park in the heart of Portland is one of the largest urban forests in the U.S. There have been frequent reports of fires at unsanctioned campsites and at clusters of RVs across the city from illegal burning, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The city stressed that the rule was to prevent fires from starting in the city but also to protect homeless people from blazes started near encampments by others. Nonprofit groups working with the city will visit the camps, provide information about fire risk and help residents relocate voluntarily before any aggressive sweeps take place, the newspaper said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGettysburg: Authorities have announced the arrest of a new suspect in a rape and murder more than three decades ago for which another man served 16 years in prison before he was exonerated by DNA evidence. State police and Adams County prosecutors said Chris Speelman, 58, of New Oxford is charged with criminal homicide, rape, robbery and burglary in the August 1987 slaying of 85-year-old Edna Laughman. Lt. Mark Magyar said the arrest was made possible by advances in genetic genealogy and the hard work of investigators. District Attorney Brian Sinnett said a company analyzing the DNA profile provided by investigators came up with a list of surnames, including Speelman’s, and other information including hair and eye color. Sinnett said Speelman had lived next-door to the victim “within the same structure” about a decade before her murder. A DNA sample provided by him a few months ago was “an absolute match” to the suspect’s DNA, he said. Another man, Barry Laughman, a distant relative of the victim, was convicted in 1988 and served 16 years before he was cleared.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Mayor Jorge Elorza had to be held back from Gov. Dan McKee during a disagreement over a proposed contract for the city’s public school teachers. During a ceremonial lighting of the WaterFire basins along the Providence River to mark the return of the city arts festival on Wednesday, Elorza was seen on video pointing his finger at McKee and yelling, “You’ve got to face the community on this.” Elorza was held back by a member of McKee’s state police security detail. Both men are Democrats. Elorza confirmed after the event he was trying to discuss the teachers contract. He wants the contract made public before the teachers’ union votes on it Friday so the community can have input. The state has taken control of the city’s underperforming schools. “If you believe it’s a transformational contract, stand before the community and tell them why you believe it’s transformational,” Elorza said. “But simply hiding and doing it in secret and wanting to wrap this up before facing the community, that’s not the way that this is supposed to be done.” McKee declined to comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLaurens: Malouf Companies, which warehouses and distributes home furnishings and other consumer products, is investing $47.2 million in a project in Laurens County and will create 240 new jobs, Gov. Henry McMaster’s office said in a news release. “We couldn’t be more excited to congratulate Malouf for its decision to establish its first South Carolina facility in Laurens County. This $47.2 million investment, along with the 240 new jobs it will create, are huge wins for the community, and we look forward to seeing this great company continue to grow,” McMaster said. Malouf’s new facility will increase the company’s warehousing capabilities and improve distribution capacity to meet demand, officials said. The new facility is expected to be operational by Nov. 30. The Coordinating Council for Economic Development has approved a $200,000 Rural Infrastructure Fund grant to Laurens County to assist with site preparation and building improvements.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem barred the state’s Department of Education from applying for federal grants in history or civics over concerns about how certain teachings on systemic racism would be tied to the grants. The U.S. Department of Education this month backed away from proposed grant guidelines that suggested using curricula that teach racism is embedded into the country’s institutions. After releasing proposed rules for the $3 million American History and Civics Education grant program in April that included references to the New York Times’ “1619 Project” and “anti-racism” teaching, the U.S. Department of Education had faced backlash from conservatives, who argued it was an example of critical race theory making its way into elementary and high school classrooms. “Our students should learn America’s true history by studying both our triumphs and our mistakes,” Noem said in a statement. “Only then will students learn that America remains the shining example of exceptionalism throughout the history of the world.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Seven unemployed Tennessee residents have filed a lawsuit over Gov. Bill Lee’s decision to opt out of the federal unemployment benefits programs earlier this year. They said in a federal complaint filed this week against Lee and Department of Labor Commissioner Jeff McCord that they struggle to survive on state unemployment funds as they look for work, news outlets reported. They are asking a federal judge to instruct Lee to reenter the federally funded pandemic unemployment compensation programs run by U.S. Department of Labor. “This program has served as a lifeline for thousands of Tennesseans who remain affected by the pandemic,” Nashville attorneys W. Gary Blackburn and Bryant Kroll wrote. State officials declined to comment on pending litigation. Lee announced in May that Tennessee would withdraw from federal unemployment programs that would pay an additional $300 a week in benefit payments. The state reverted Sunday to benefits through Tennessee’s Unemployment Compensation program, which pays up to $275 a week.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The city announced that Lou Neff Road and all associated parking along the loop around the Zilker Park Great Lawn will remain closed through Aug. 7 and will reopen Aug. 8. The work to realign the road, accommodate ADA improvements, perform asphalt maintenance and make electrical service modifications was scheduled to be finished by Friday, but the asphalt work has been delayed to minimize the impact on park programming. During this road closure, the Austin Parks Foundation is asking Zilker Park visitors to take alternate forms of transportation, including bicycles, ride sharing and public transportation. As parking will be limited during this time, using CapMetro is highly encouraged. The CapMetro 30 Local route goes to Zilker Park via Barton Springs Road.\n\nUtah\n\nHurricane:A missing 4-year-old boy who was found dead in his toy chest died accidently of positional asphyxiation, police said. The search for Kache Wallis of Hurricane began Sunday after his family woke up in the morning and discovered he wasn’t in his bed. Police, family and friends conducted searches inside and outside the house before someone opened the small toy chest and found the boy inside. The Utah Medical Examiner’s Office investigated the cause of death. Police said it was caused by positional asphyxiation, or a lack of air because of the position of a person’s body. The Hurricane Police offered their condolences to the boy’s family.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington:A bridge will be closed for repairs for the next three months between South Burlington and Williston, and the closure is expected to cause traffic delays on other roads, the Vermont Agency of Transportation said. The Muddy Brook Bridge between Kimball Avenue in South Burlington and Marshall Avenue in Williston will be closed starting on Monday, the agency said. Drivers should expect increased traffic on U.S. Route 2 and Vermont Route 2A and additional traffic delays in the area, the agency said. They are encouraged to add extra time to their travel plans or take other routes. The bridge is expected to be closed until November.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Health officials are warning people and pets to avoid swimming or wading in the James River after hundreds of thousands of gallons of sewage spilled from a Goochland County sewer line into a tributary of the river. The Department of Health issued an advisory Thursday after the sewage release from the sewer line into Tuckahoe Creek on Tuesday night, news outlets reported. The Goochland County Department of Public Utilities shut off the pipe less than four hours later, but not before 300,000 gallons of “raw, undiluted sewage” spilled into nearby Tuckahoe Creek. The water advisory applies to Tuckahoe Creek beginning at River Road and the James River from Robious Landing Park in Chesterfield, Goochland, and Henrico counties to Belle Isle in Richmond. Officials warned that swallowing contaminated water from the river could cause gastrointestinal illnesses and that external contact could cause “infections of the ears, nose, throat and skin.” There is no impact on drinking water at this time, officials said. An end date for the advisory will be based on bacteria levels in the water.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three schoolteachers in the state who sued chemical company Monsanto over exposure to materials in fluorescent lights have been awarded $185 million. The law firm that represented the teachers, Friedman Rubin, said a jury returned the verdict Tuesday in King County Superior Court. The teachers, who worked at the Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe, said they suffered brain damage from exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the fluorescent lighting at the school. “This is a big step in holding Monsanto accountable,” the teachers’ attorney, Rick Friedman, said in a statement. Bayer, which bought Monsanto in 2018, said the company disagreed with the verdict and might appeal. The company said the light ballasts that were the focus of the lawsuit were obsolete. This was the first of 22 trials involving teachers, parents and students who spent time at the Sky Valley Education Center. A 2019 Associated Press investigation found that millions of fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs probably remain in schools and day care centers across the U.S. four decades after the chemicals were banned over concerns that they could cause cancer and other illnesses. Many older buildings also have caulk, ceiling tiles, floor adhesives and paint made with PCBs, which sometimes have been found at levels far higher than allowed by law. PCBs are mixtures of compounds manufactured by Monsanto Co. and widely used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned in 1979.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: Workers began repairs this week on West Virginia 2 in Mason County on a slip believed to have been caused by heavy rains earlier this month. Both lanes will be closed from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. beginning Wednesday and running for about four days. Emergency and mail delivery vehicles will be allowed to pass through while both lanes are closed, the Department of Transportation said in a news release. “The area presented a challenge due to the length of the slip,” said Kathy Rushworth, Division of Highways District 1 maintenance engineer. “We gathered information and considered several methods of repair and chose soil nails as the most efficient and effective for the location.” One lane of West Virginia 2 will reopen after the initial closure until repairs are finished in about four weeks. The location is near the Jackson County line.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Strong thunderstorms caused widespread damage across Wisconsin, left tens of thousands without power and triggered tornado warnings. The severe weather stretched from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan and began Wednesday night in northwestern Wisconsin. By 2 a.m. Thursday, the numerous tornado warnings across the state expired. The National Weather Service surveyed hard-hit areas in southeastern Wisconsin and confirmed it was a tornado, probably rated EF1, that caused damage around the Jefferson County community of Concord, where the storm toppled farm buildings and left a path of destruction. Cows could be seen grazing among debris that landed in farm fields. Gov. Tony Evers signed a declaration imposing a state of emergency in Wisconsin. Evers’ order directs state agencies to help those impacted by the storms. It also allows the Wisconsin National Guard to be activated to support local authorities with recovery efforts. Meteorologist Denny VanCleve in Sullivan said there’s a good chance that it was a tornado, or possibly two, that caused widespread damage. Utility crews worked to restore service to thousands of power customers. Electricity was knocked out to about 90,000 customers across Wisconsin, according to the tracking website PowerOutage, US. The tornado warnings started in Wausau and were issued for Waukesha, Jefferson and Milwaukee counties around 1 a.m. Thursday. The National Weather Service placed nearly the entire state under a severe thunderstorm watch until 2 a.m. Thursday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man was run over and killed by a pickup truck during Cheyenne Frontier Days. The accident happened Tuesday morning near a carnival area next to the rodeo grounds. The victim, whose identity wasn’t released, was riding in the bed of a full-size pickup that slowed to a stop in traffic, the Cheyenne Police Department said in a statement. The man lost his footing and fell as he was getting out of the truck bed. The driver of the other pickup truck pulled ahead with the flow of traffic and ran over the man, police said. An ambulance took the man to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Frontier Days was back this year after being canceled for the first time in 2020 because of the coronavirus.

At least one of them, Howard University, also received a bomb threat Monday.\n\n“We’ve had these challenges before,” Howard University President Wayne Frederick said Tuesday. But “since I’ve been here (as a student) in 1988, it has not been this widespread and also, I think, this overt.”\n\nUS Education Secretary Miguel Cardona called the threats “disturbing” and said they would not be tolerated.\n\n“My team will continue to work with students, faculty, and alumni to make sure HBCUs continue to be a safe place for students to learn,” Cardona tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThese are some of the universities that reported bomb threats Tuesday:\n\nCoppin State University\n\nSomeone called the Baltimore university and said there was a bomb on campus, Coppin State spokesperson Angela Galeano told CNN. She said the threat was immediately reported to campus police.\n\nA message on the university’s website said all classes would be online Tuesday.\n\n“If you are on campus, please, shelter in place, and wait for further instructions,” the message said. “Emergency officials are evaluating the campus and we will provide updates, as soon as possible.”\n\nSabrina Taylor, the undergraduate program director at Coppin State, said she got a call at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday telling her not to come to work because there was an emergency on campus.\n\n\"I want my students know that no one can stop them,\" Coppin State professor Sabrina Taylor said. courtesy Sabrina Taylor\n\nWhen she learned the emergency was a bomb threat, Taylor said she was saddened for the students.\n\n“Many of our students in the HBCUs, they are first-generation college students. And they are there to advance their education and to create opportunity – not only for themselves, but for their families,” said Taylor, an assistant professor at the school.\n\n“Now they have to deal with bomb threats.”\n\nTaylor said she immediately reached out to her students to check in and make sure they felt supported and safe.\n\n“I wanted to encourage them to be empowered and I wanted to encourage them to realize that even though they are being threatened and they are experiencing adversity, they are walking in their purpose,” she said.\n\n“They are on their path to greatness, and they cannot let individuals who their intention is to cause destruction, chaos and fear and doubt, stop them from walking and their purpose.”\n\nJackson State University\n\nJackson State University in Missisippi is one of the largest HBCUs in the country.

I think that the threats aren’t individual or coincidental – that it’s a clear attack on Black students who choose to go to Black schools.”\n\nWhile it’s not clear who made the threat, “I think the uncertainty, especially in the age of Covid and heightened race relations, is part of the goal of whomever has been making the threats,” White said.\n\nLike so many, White said he doesn’t understand why such threats keep happening.\n\n“But I understand that HBCUs are starting to see large influxes of students, supporters, donors, etc., and our presence is more important now than ever,” he said.\n\n“I think the idea of HBCUs in a current-day sense is taking over. They aren’t just looked at as a beacon of the past, but a marker of the future.”\n\nMississippi Valley State University\n\nThe university said a bomb threat was received through its guardhouse early Tuesday morning.\n\n“MVSU is currently on lockdown, and campus police are conducting a complete investigation,” a university Facebook post read.\n\n“School officials are working with local emergency personnel to investigate and determine the extent of the threat.”\n\nClasses were remote Tuesday, and the university asked all on-campus students to stay in their residence halls.

Plus, midterm elections are looming as Trump faces low approval ratings.\n\nTrump will deliver the address before a joint session of Congress but, bucking tradition, many lawmakers will not be in attendance. Several prominent Democrats, including Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., are planning a boycott of the State of the Union and instead attending what they're calling the \"People's State of the Union.\" Rep.

But it was his first time appearing before a joint session of Congress in a new era of divided government in which Democrats now control the House.\n\nStanding in front of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump made reference to the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller as well as congressional probes, saying that a thriving economy could be put at risk by \"ridiculous partisan investigations.\"\n\nOne of the more dramatic moments during Trump's speech came when he mentioned women getting the right to vote a century ago and the fact that currently the United States has \"more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\"\n\nDemocratic women lawmakers stood up and gave high fives to one another. Both sides chanted: \"USA, USA!\" while one Democrat yelled, \"Thank you, Nancy!\"\n\nPolitically wounded by the 35-day government shutdown, Trump laid out a vision for the second half of his term even as his domestic agenda risks being swallowed by the looming 2020 election, a growing number of investigations and a chaotic turnover of top officials in his administration.\n\nAfter two years of working with a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump must contend with a Democratic House majority vehemently opposed to much of his agenda, including his proposal for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn a statement after Trump's speech, Pelosi accused Trump of \"fear-mongering and manufacturing a crisis at the border.\"\n\n“It will take days to fact-check all the misrepresentations that the President made tonight,\" Pelosi said.\n\nStacey Abrams, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor in Georgia last year, used the Democratic response to blame Trump for the government shutdown, calling it a “stunt engineered by the president.” She breezed through a litany of differences Democrats have with Trump, including gun control, the GOP tax cuts, immigration, climate change and the wall.\n\n\"In Georgia and around the country, people are striving for a middle class where a salary truly equals economic security,\" she said. \"But instead, families’ hopes are being crushed by Republican leadership that ignores real life or just doesn’t understand it.\"\n\nDuring the president's remarks about border security, most Democrats remained seated and stoned-faced. Many of them sighed when Trump discussed caravans from Central America moving north to the U.S. – a symbol Trump frequently uses to warn of what he says are threats from illegal immigration.\n\nTrump repeated his claims that a wall would sharply reduce the flow of migrants and drugs over the border, although outside experts have questioned many of Trump's assertions about the effectiveness of a wall.\n\n\"It will get built,\" Trump said. He described the wall as \"a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier – not just a simple concrete wall.\"\n\nTrump insisted that “the lawless state” of the southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. The U.S. has “a moral duty” to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of American citizens, he said.\n\nIllegal border crossings are, in fact, far lower than they were even a decade ago, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Border patrol agents apprehended just under 304,000 people attempting to cross the southwest border in 2017, down from about 859,000 in 2007 and more than a million in 2006.\n\nWhile Trump called at several points in the speech for bipartisan cooperation, its very timing has laid bare the conflicts that have already arisen with newly empowered House Democrats. Pelosi pressed Trump to reschedule the address, originally set for Jan. 29, because of the federal shutdown.\n\nThe president initially refused, and then ultimately relented.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as a bipartisan group of lawmakers works against a Feb. 15 deadline to hammer out a compromise on agency funding or risk another government shutdown.\n\nThe president has described that effort as a \"waste of time\" and has held out the possibility of declaring a national emergency to free up funding for the wall if the congressional panel does not deliver on his demand for the barrier.\n\nIf Trump were to declare a border emergency, the move could allow him redirect billions of dollars in military construction projects. But it would also likely trigger a legal battle that could drag on in court for years.\n\nContributed: Eliza Collins, Deborah Barfield Berryand Maureen Groppe", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/04/donald-trump-speech-address-to-congress-live-updates/81142181007/", "title": "Trump speech replay: President touts progress as Dems walk out", "text": "March 4, 2025 Updated March 5, 2025, 11:16 a.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump drilled down on inflation, immigration, anti-DEI efforts and DOGE's sweeping cuts to the federal government in his Tuesday primetime address to a joint session of Congress, vowing that his administration is \"just getting started.\"\n\n\"Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty,\" Trump said during his speech.\n\nSince beginning his second term, the president has teed up tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, fired thousands of federal workers as part of a campaign to cut government spending and berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump on Tuesday applauded the honored guests in the audience, including family members of Corey Comperatore, the man who was killed in a shocking shooting at a Trump campaign rally last July.

Trump said in his speech that the Ukrainian leader also made a personal gesture in the form of a letter.\n\n“I appreciate that he sent this letter,” Trump said. “Simultaneously, we’ve had serious discussions with Russia, and I’ve received strong signals that they are ready for peace.”\n\n“Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” he added.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump gives longest presidential speech to Congress in modern time\n\nTrump blew past former President Bill Clinton’s record for the longest speech to Congress in modern time Tuesday night.\n\nTrump spoke for one hour, thirty nine minutes and 32 seconds, according to data compiled by the University of California- Santa Barbara’s The American Presidency Project.\n\nClinton’s final State of the Union in 2000, lasted one hour, 28 minutes and 49 seconds.\n\nTrump also far exceeded the average speaking time from his first administration.

Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong,” the president said, only half-joking.\n\nOf his desire to acquire Greenland, the president said, he supports the right of the Danish territory’s people to determine their own future.\n\nHowever, he added, in an aside: “I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it.”\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says plotter of bombing during US evacuation from Afghanistan detained, on way to US\n\nWithout naming him, Trump said Tuesday night that the person who the U.S. claims plotted the deadly Abbey Gate bombing during the U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan in 2021, has been detained and is on his way to the United States to be tried. Trump said the government of Pakistan helped with the arrest.\n\nThirteen American service members were killed in the bomb attack at the Kabul Airport.\n\n“Tonight I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” he said.

Two other police officers, Howard Liebengood and Jeffrey Smith, died by suicide a few days after the riots.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\n‘We cannot normalize this'\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley was one of several Democrats to walk out of the chamber as Trump addressed a joint session of Congress. She said initially she wasn’t going to attend at all.\n\n‘’We cannot normalize this. This man has no respect for Congress,’’ said Pressley, who was dressed in black in solidarity with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. “He does not respect us as a co-equal branch of government. He has contempt for the American people. He pardoned January Sixers, who desecrated the very well that we’re in today.”\n\nPressley spoke at an online town hall during a program called “State of the People,’’ a 24-hour livestream to counter Trump’s address.\n\n− Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nTrump remembers Laken Riley as he addresses southern border\n\nTrump in his speech brought up Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant previously arrested for shoplifting.\n\nHer death became a rallying cry for Republicans during the 2024 race as they called for better border security.\n\nTrump signed a bill last month dubbed the “Laken Riley Act,” that would require Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission who are accused of certain crimes including burglary, theft, larceny and shoplifting or assaulting a law enforcement officer.\n\n“Last year, I told Laken’s grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain,” Trump said.\n\nThe reference to her parents is one of the few times Democrats have clapped during Trump's sister. Riley’s mom and sister were invited as honored guests to Trump’s joint address Tuesday evening.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi and Sarah Wire\n\nTrump acknowledges his new tariffs will cause ‘a little disturbance’\n\nAs he defended his newly imposed tariffs, Trump acknowledged the new duties on imports from Canada and Mexico will cause a “little disturbance” but said it will be worth it.\n\n“Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,” Trump said. “And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that.”\n\nEconomists expect Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico to lead to higher prices of many goods at a time when inflation already remains stubborn. The stock market has nosedived for two straight days following Trump’s latest tariff announcement.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nTrump defends tariff policy in speech\n\nTrump dedicated a lengthy portion of his speech to explaining the tariffs that have been a pillar of his economic policy in the first six weeks of his presidency.\n\nCompanies that choose not to make their products in America “will pay a tariff, and in some cases, a rather large one,” Trump said.\n\nReciprocal actions against countries that put tariffs and nontariff barriers on imports from the U.S. will go into effect on April 2.\n\n“I wanted to make it April 1, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day,” Trump said. “But we're going to do it in April. I’m a very superstitious person.”\n\nSumming up his policy he said: “Whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho is sitting behind Trump?\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance are sitting next to each at the dais behind Trump.\n\nThis is the traditional spot for the leader of the House chamber and the White House's No. 2, who also serves as president of the Senate.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nDemocrats walk out of Trump’s speech in protest\n\nSeveral Democrats, including Reps. Lateefah Simon, D-Calif., Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas., and Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., have walked out of the House chamber during Trump’s speech.\n\nSome wore black t-shirts with the word “RESIST” in white letters on the back.\n\n“Through walking out, my message to Donald Trump is simple: stop the lies, stop the cheating, and stop the stealing - enough is enough. The American people deserve better,” she shared on X.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nBlaming Biden\n\nIt’s been nearly six weeks since Joe Biden left office, but Trump is still eager to use his predecessor as a punching bag as the economy wobbles.\n\nTrump blamed Biden Tuesday for the price of eggs and more.\n\nThe stock market dipped after Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect this week and the tariff on Chinese goods jumped from 10% to 20%. Inflation has creeped back up and consumer confidence is down.\n\nFor Trump, though, it’s Biden’s policies that are the problem.\n\n“We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” Trump said.\n\nTrump also criticized illegal immigration levels under Biden, and slammed his administration’s energy policies.\n\n−Zac Anderson\n\nTouting Elon Musk and DOGE\n\nElon Musk had a prime seat for Trump’s speech in the House gallery and his work with the Department of Government Efficiency was front and center in Trump’s remarks.\n\nMusk has been the dominant player in Trump’s administration other than president himself, tearing through federal agencies as the driving force behind DOGE. It has moved with lightning speed to cut government, implementing mass layoffs and wreaking havoc at various federal agencies. The cuts have sparked a growing backlash.\n\nTrump said Musk is “working very hard.”\n\n“He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it,” Trump said. The president then listed off federal spending he described as “scams” that DOGE has targeted.\n\nMusk stood up in the gallery, nodding his head in acknowledgement as Republicans applauded.\n\nTrump said DOGE is “headed” by Musk but his administration, which is contrary to what the administration said in a recent court filing. The White House has said Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of DOGE.\n\n−Zac Anderson\n\nWho are the women with Melania Trump?\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump was joined at the speech by two young women who exemplify causes she has championed.\n\nThe first lady’s guests are Elliston Berry of Aledo, Texas, a victim of an AI-generated, sexually explicit “deepfake” image, and Haley Ferguson of Spring Hill, Tennessee, a former foster child who is the recipient of a scholarship instituted during Trump’s first tenure as first lady.\n\nBerry was also at Melania Trump's side on Capitol Hill on Monday as the first lady used her first public comments since her husband's inauguration to speak out about the publication of non-consensual, sexually explicit images.\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump blames Biden for inflation under his watch\n\nTrump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for stubborn inflation, vowing he’s “fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.”\n\n“Joe Biden, especially, let the price of eggs get out of control,” Trumps said, even though egg prices have soared amid bird flu outbreaks during the Trump presidency.\n\nThe consumer price index rose during Trump’s first month in office from where it was when Biden left the White House.\n\nTrump touted his administration’s efforts to lower energy prices including expanding federal oil and gas leases.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump thanks Supreme Court for anti-affirmative action decision\n\nTrump thanked the Supreme Court for a “brave and very powerful” decision that he said declared people should get jobs based on merit and not race or gender.\n\nHe appeared to be referring to the 2023 decision that effectively ended affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nTrump has taken various steps to end DEI policies, which the White House calls discrimination.\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nWho is Al Green?\n\nYou may have seen Democratic Rep. Al Green demonstrate during Trump's speech on Tuesday. But who is the lawmaker?\n\nHe represents Texas’ ninth congressional district, which covers the southern Houston metro area. He currently serves on the Financial Services Committee as well as the Committee on Homeland Security.\n\nGreen announced in February that he would file articles of impeachment against Trump over “injustice in Gaza” - an effort that will likely be fruitless under a Republican majority in both chambers.\n\n“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. and injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America,\" Green said in a floor speech.\n\nThe effort came after Trump had proposed turning the Gaza Strip into the \"Riviera of the Middle East.”\n\nA vocal Trump critic, Green also filed multiple longshot impeachment bids against Trump during his first term.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump touts DEI cuts\n\nTrump boasted that he’d “ended the tyranny” of diversity, equity and inclusion – DEI – policies in the federal government, including the U.S. military.\n\n“And our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in January abolishing the DEI programs in the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump also touted his declaration that the U.S. recognizes only two genders and his policies restricting transgender Americans. Payton McNabb, a former high school athlete from Murphy, N.C., who suffered a brain injury after a transgender female athlete spiked a ball at her in a volleyball match in 2022, was an honored guest at the speech.\n\n\"It's out of our society. We don't want it,\" Trump said late in the speech. \"Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone, it's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better?\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers, Savannah Kuchar\n\n'How did that work out': Trump mocks Democrats for criminal prosecutions\n\nDonald Trump made a dig at attempts to prosecute him after leaving office in 2021.\n\nTrump was charged in relation to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol and for refusing to return classified documents he took upon leaving office. During the campaign he said without evidence the cases were proof that Joe Biden and Democrats were “weaponizing” the Justice Department against their political rival.\n\n\"We have ended weaponized government,\" Trump said. \"Where, as for an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good.\"\n\nBoth cases were dropped after he won in November.\n\n−Sarah D.

Lance Gooden of Texas ripped it out of her hands and threw it, nearly hitting the president's head as he walked down the aisle.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\n‘Nothing I can do’: Trump criticizes Democratic foes\n\nDonald Trump took an early swing at his opponents, calling predecessor Joe Biden “the worst president in American history.”\n\nHe then addressed the Democrats sitting before him in the chamber – several waving signs that read “FALSE” or “MUSK STEALS” in reference to Trump’s billionaire ally.\n\n“I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do,” Trump said.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump kicks off speech with southern border\n\nMuch like the 2024 campaign, Trump used Tuesday's speech to talk about securing the U.S.-Mexico border and the executive orders he issued, including deploying military members to the area.\n\nHe also touted his focus on mass deportations and other crackdowns, telling lawmakers that migrants \"heard my words. and they chose not to come much easier that way.\"\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nDemocratic lawmaker interrupts, is drowned out with chants of 'USA'\n\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, stood and interrupted Trump as he started speaking. \"You don't have a mandate,\" Green began, before the GOP stood and drowned him out with jeers and a chant of \"USA.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson warned him before calling for him to be removed.\n\nWhen guards began removing him, House Republicans sang \"hey, hey, hey, goodbye.\"\n\nSome Democrats yelled: \"Take your hat off\" to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who is wearing a Make America Great Again hat on the floor, which is against House rules.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nTrump begins address by declaring ‘America is back’\n\nTrump began his joint address to Congress by declaring “America is back,” prompting chants of “USA!” from Republican members of Congress in attendance.\n\n“Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America,” Trump said. “From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.”\n\nTrump said his administration has accomplished more in 43 days than most presidents have in eight years, adding: “And we are just getting started.”\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump enters chamber\n\nTrump entered the House chambers at 9:13 p.m. ET and shook hands with Republican lawmakers eager to greet the president.\n\nTrump is accompanied by Republican lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo. and House GOP Whip Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn.\n\nMost Democrats remain seated as President Donald Trump enters the chamber. The few standing are not applauding, while the Republican side is cheering and clapping. Republicans broke out in a chant of USA.\n\nTrump is expected to speak imminently.\n\n− Joey Garrison and Riley Beggin\n\nTrump's family turn up for the joint address\n\nTrump’s family showed up in full force for his address Tuesday before a joint session of Congress.\n\nAll of his children, except his youngest son, Barron Trump, were in attendance.\n\nHis oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was accompanied by Bettina Anderson; his daughter Ivanka Trump came with her husband, Jared Kushner; his son Eric Trump was joined by his wife Lara Trump; his younger daughter Tiffany Trump came with her husband Michael Boulos.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump brought two special guests to the event, Elliston Berry of Aledo, Texas, a victim of an AI-generated, sexually explicit “deepfake” image, and Haley Ferguson of Spring Hill, Tennessee, a former foster child who is the recipient of a scholarship instituted during Trump’s first tenure as first lady.\n\n− Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nMelania Trump, presidential Cabinet enters chamber\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump has entered the chamber ahead of Trump's Cabinet. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, followed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, led the group.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nFour Supreme Court justices attending speech\n\nFour of the nine Supreme Court Justices – including two of the three Trump appointed during his first term – are on hand to hear the president’s address.\n\nTheir appearance could draw more attention than usual because of the court’s role as the final arbiter of the dozens of legal challenges mounted against Trump’s blizzard of early actions. Trump, who has expressed confidence that the court will back him, is pushing the boundaries on past court decisions on executive authority and is explicitly trying to get some overturned.\n\nComments that some in the administration have made criticizing judges have raised fears that the president may refuse to comply with decisions he opposes – something his spokeswoman has dismissed as “fearmongering.”\n\nThe justices who will be listening closely to anything Trump says about the courts are: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nRetired Justice Anthony Kennedy is also attending.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump to defend newly imposed tariffs, according to speech excerpts\n\nTrump will defend his recently imposed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that have sent the stock market plummeting – and will blame his predecessor for soaring egg prices – according to excerpts released by the White House of Trump’s speech.\n\n“Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,” Trump will say, according to the excerpts. “If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. We will take in trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before.”\n\nTrump campaigned on lowering prices, but inflation ticked up in his first month in office. Consumer confidence metrics have dropped amid continued concerns about the cost of living include egg prices that have soared amid ongoing bird flu outbreaks.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nUsha Vance, Ivanka Trump, Kash Patel: Family members, top aides come together\n\nVice President JD Vance's wife Usha Vance has a front row seat in the gallery above the Republican side of the chamber.\n\nThe row behind her sits the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. Tiffany Trump is in the row behind her.\n\nThe president's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are also sitting nearby.\n\nThe newly-confirmed director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Kash Patel, is also sitting in the gallery. Typically, Cabinet members sit on the House floor.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\n‘State of DisUnion’: Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett evokes Kendrick Lamar ahead of Donald Trump speech\n\nPlenty of House Democrats are boycotting Trump’s joint address by joining other events, but not Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who has made many viral moments since being elected to Congress in 2022.\n\n“Well… the State of the DisUnion will begin shortly,” the 43-year-old Texas Democrat shared on X. “I’m gonna be in attendance.”\n\nThe post was accompanied by a video of Crockett and her staff dancing from her office through the building to Grammy award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us,” which he performed at during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n“The country’s divided, somebody’s gotta fight for it,” a caption above the video said.\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTonight’s designated survivor: Doug Collins\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is tonight’s designated survivor, or the government official picked to sit out from attending the speech as a way to maintain the presidential line of succession in case of emergency, CNN and ABC reported.\n\nThe concept began with former President Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nElon Musk enters gallery\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk, wearing a suit and a blue tie and no DOGE or MAGA merch, entered the House gallery above the Republican side of the chamber.\n\nOther people in the gallery, who are primarily guests of Republican members, applauded him as he entered.\n\nHe took his phone out and took a video of the room, smiling.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nJD Vance enters House chambers\n\nVice President JD Vance entered the House chamber, followed by members of the U.S. Senate.\n\nVance is shaking hands with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as he walks toward the dais, including lingering chats with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, among others.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nHouse members wait for Trump; Democratic women wear pink\n\nHouse members are chatting in the House chamber as they wait for senators, Supreme Court justices and Cabinet members to enter.\n\nMore than 30 Democratic women are wearing pink to protest what they're calling the impact of Trump's policies on women.\n\n\"Pink is a color of protest & power. We're sending a message: Trump’s policies are devastating women,\" Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., wrote on X. \"He's raising grocery prices, he’s stealing health care, & he’s threatening our safety.\"\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump makes way to the Capitol\n\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump exited the White House at 8:32 p.m. ET and boarded the presidential vehicle on the South Lawn.\n\nThe motorcade is now making the short drive from the White House to the Capitol, where Trump is scheduled to address Congress shortly after 9 p.m.\n\nTech entrepreneur Elon Musk, a top White House adviser, was spotted by reporters leaving the White House before the Trumps. Musk is expected to attend the joint address in a public display of his enormous influence in the Trump administration.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHow long will Trump’s speech be tonight?\n\nIf history holds true, Trump will speak for around an hour to an hour and twenty minutes tonight when he addresses Congress for the first time of his second term.\n\nAt least, that’s the range he stayed in while addressing Congress in his first term, according to data compiled by the University of California- Santa Barbara’s The American Presidency Project.\n\nHis 2017 speech, which remember like this one isn’t technically a State of the Union speech, came in shortest at almost exactly an hour. And his 2019 State of the Union was the longest at one hour, 22 minutes and 25 seconds.\n\nThat 2019 speech put him within spitting distance of the longest address to Congress by a president in modern times, which was President Bill Clinton’s final State of the Union in 2000, which lasted one hour, 28 minutes and 49 seconds.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire\n\nTrump forgoes post-speech barnstorm, sends VP Vance out instead\n\nTrump will give the customary speech tonight, but there’s one tradition he's bucking: a post-address publicity tour. The Republican president will spend Wednesday at the White House in meetings, including one with Hill leaders to discuss his agenda. He’ll also sign executive orders, an official said.\n\nMembers of his Cabinet are not planning to barnstorm the country, either. They’ll do interviews from the White House to underscore his message. The only Cabinet official with high-profile travel is Vice President JD Vance. He’ll visit Eagle Pass, Texas, tour the border and meet with government and law enforcement officials, a person familiar with his schedule said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho’s on the guest list for tonight’s address?\n\nDuring Trump’s address tonight, about 200 to 300 guests are expected to file into the packed House chamber. Fifteen of those received an invitation from the president or first lady Melania Trump, while several other Americans are there at the request of members of Congress.\n\nAmong the first family’s guest list are relatives of Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter shot and killed during an attempted assassination on Trump in July, as well as Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student killed by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant.\n\nSenators and representatives will also be bringing guests. Democrats in particular are using their invitations to spotlight people they say have been directly impacted by Trump's second term policies, including federal workers recently fired as a result of his and Elon Musk's government downsize efforts.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho's the designated survivor? It's not clear\n\nIf you're hearing about a designated survivor for tonight, it's not because of the three-season drama.\n\nDuring the president's annual speech to Congress, officials pick one Cabinet official in the presidential line of succession, and they become known as the \"designated survivor.\" That person doesn't attend the address, instead staying in another location in case the unthinkable happens at the Capitol building.\n\nThe 2025 designated survivor hasn't been confirmed yet.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen is Trump's speech? EST to CST and other time zones\n\nTrump is set to speak at 9 p.m. EST. But if you live in other time zones, here's what you need to know: He'll start his address at 8 p.m. CST, 7 p.m. MST and 6 p.m. PST.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump to give speech amid growing economic concerns, tumbling stock market\n\nAnxiety about the state of the economy and inflation under Biden helped catapult Trump back to the White House.\n\nBut as he prepares to give his first joint address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump will face a nation starting to grow skeptical of his ability to achieve one of his core campaign promises ‒ lowering their cost of living.\n\nA poll from Marist University/NPR released Monday found 57% of Americans believe grocery prices will increase over the next six months, while only 17% believe they will decrease. In the same poll, 54% of Americans said the country is moving in the wrong direction, and more Americans, by a 46%-42% margin, believe Trump's direction on the economy is for the worse than for the better.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s new 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which went into effect Tuesday, caused the stock market to tumble for the second straight day. Economists warn that tariffs on imports typically lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will touch on the economy in his speech and changes his administration has implemented \"to end inflation for all Americans.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump administration revises directive on firing federal workers\n\nAhead of Trump’s joint address to Congress, the Trump administration informed federal departments Tuesday that any firings of their probationary workers are up to the agencies themselves in an update to its policy after a federal judge last week paused recent mass terminations.\n\nThe revised guidance from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management states that \"OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees,\" adding that \"agencies have ultimate decisionmaking authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"\n\nJudge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern California District last Thursday ruled the OPM lacked authority to order firings as he temporarily blocked the Trump administration from its mass firing of probationary federal employees,\n\nBut he stopped short of ordering that terminations of probationary workers be rescinded. Likewise, the newly issued OPM guidance on Tuesday does not tell federal departments to rescind terminations already made.\n\nTrump is expected to use his speech to defend his efforts to dismantle the federal government including laying off tens of thousands of recently hired or promoted probationary workers. The moves have been steered by the Department of Government Efficiency led by billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nProtester at Capitol criticizes Republicans ahead of Trump's joint address\n\nJust hours before Trump was scheduled to deliver his joint address to lawmakers, Andrea Wilson, a 63-year-old retiree, was pacing back and forth in front of the Capitol with a sign that had billionaire Elon Musk’s face on it. It read in all caps, “I am stealing from you.”\n\nHer sign was referencing Musk’s campaign to slash government spending, with critics raising concerns that his cuts could target Medicare and Social Security. Wilson, who drove from Maryland to D.C. and stood with other protesters outside of the Capitol building, said that none of what was happening under the Trump administration was “normal.”\n\nAn independent, she criticized the Democrats for being “weak” and urged party members to disrupt Trump’s speech.\n\n“They need to stand up during his entire speech and turn their backs,” she said. “They need to stop playing by the rules.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump to focus on 'renewal of the American Dream'\n\nThe White House said Trump's address on Tuesday evening will cover what press secretary Karoline Leavitt called \"his extraordinarily successful first month in office\" and his bold, ambitious, and common sense vision for the future.\"\n\nHe'll touch on the economy and changes his administration has implemented \"to end inflation for all Americans,\" she said in a news release.\n\nHe'll ask Congress for more funding for deportations and building a border wall. Leavitt said he will also lay out his plan \"to restore peace around the world.\"\n\nWho are the Dems boycotting Trump’s speech?\n\nSeveral House and Senate lawmakers said they won’t attend Trump’s joint address tonight. Instead, they'll be holding alternative events.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., wrote in a post that she would be “live posting and chatting” with her followers on Bluesky and holding an Instagram live after the president's address.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told USA TODAY he would host a virtual town hall with his constituents during Trump's speech.\n\nThe list of others skipping also includes Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Sen. Martin Heinrich, N. Mex., Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., and Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md.\n\n“I think it's going to be a MAGA pep rally, not a serious talk to the nation,” Murphy told CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote in a letter to his colleagues Monday that the decision to attend the joint address is a “personal one.” However, he added that it was “important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber.”\n\n“The House as an institution belongs to the American people, and as their representatives, we will not be run off the block or bullied,” he wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nPelosi to promote Medicaid with guest at Trump’s speech\n\nThe former House speaker, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said her guest at President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress would be a woman whose daughter relies on Medicaid. Her aim, she said, is to illustrate the potential harm of cutting the federal health program.\n\nElena Hung is the founder and executive director of Little Lobbyists, a group promoting Medicaid’s assistance to children with complex medical needs and disabilities.\n\n“Elena Hung’s courageous daughter, Xiomara, was born with a number of serious medical conditions and is thriving today as a result of access to quality health care – including Medicaid,\" Pelosi said in a statement. “At a time when Medicaid is under assault by those who seek to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations, I am honored that Xiomara’s story will be told through Elena's attendance as my guest to this year’s address to a joint session of Congress.\"\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nLivestream viewers urged to 'absolutely' not watch Trump address\n\nHours before President Donald Trump’s address, grassroots organizers, Democrats, voting rights activists and others were more than halfway through a 24-hour livestream challenging many of the administration’s policies.\n\nOrganizers of the “State of the People’’ said they wanted to offer an alternative to watching Trump’s address and provide instead information about what they called the administration’s harmful policies and actions people can take to fight them.\n\n“We are absolutely asking people not to tune into the State of the Union to be lied to, but rather turn toward truth and sit with us during this marathon in the form of a protest,’’ said Angela Rye, a political strategist and one of the organizers.\n\nThroughout the marathon, there were panels and discussions focused on a range of issues, including voting rights and abortion rights. Speakers included faith leaders, Black mayors, voting rights activists, state lawmakers, union organizers and members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\n“We’ve got to continue to push back,’’ Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, a multiracial reproductive justice organization, said during an afternoon session. “There is too much at stake.”\n\nMore than 50,000 people registered for the livestream, organizers said.\n\nStephanie Brown James, executive director and co-founder of the Collective PAC, which focuses on boosting Black political power, told viewers it was important to share what is happening in Black communities and \"spread that word.\"\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nElon Musk to meet with House Republicans Wednesday\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson sent House Republicans an email Tuesday inviting them to a meeting with Elon Musk at the Capitol on Wednesday night to discuss \"the ongoing work of the Department of Government Efficiency.\"\n\nThe meeting at 7 p.m. the day after President Donald Trump delivers his joint address to Congress comes as House Republicans have faced pushback at town halls in their home districts.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Rich Hudson, R-N.C., advised members not to hold more in-person town halls, which have gone viral as attendees raise concerns about the cuts implemented under DOGE. Republicans have argued that the influx of concerned town hall attendees was organized by Democratic groups.\n\nTrump is expected to tout Musk and DOGE's work during his joint address on Tuesday evening.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nZelenskyy offers to work with Trump on peace deal\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday in a social media post he is ready to work with President Donald Trump on a peace deal with Russia after the two men reached an impasse in a heated, high-profile Oval Office meeting Friday.\n\nZelenskyy also put out a series of messages about calls he'd had with political leaders in the United Kingdom, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nTrump announced late Monday he would stop supplying Ukraine with U.S. weapons. Zelenskyy said in his post it was time to make things right by expressing gratitude for U.S. support and praising “Trump’s strong leadership.”\n\n\"None of us wants an endless war,” Zelenskyy said. “Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.”– Bart Jansen\n\nJeffries calls for a 'dignified Democratic presence.'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he and other members of the party’s leadership plan to attend President Donald Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress to “make clear to the nation that there is a strong opposition party ready, willing and able to serve as a check and balance on the excesses of the administration.’’\n\nIn a letter Monday night to fellow Democrats, Jeffries, of New York, urged his peers to consider showing up.\n\n“The decision to attend the Joint Session is a personal one and we understand that members will come to different conclusions,’’ he wrote. “However, it is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber.’’\n\nHouse Democrats, meanwhile, are planning other events, including press conferences and hearings, throughout the week to push back on some of Trump’s policies, including proposed cuts to Medicaid. They also plan to host an event on Wednesday, a day after Trump’s address, on the east front of the Capitol.\n\nOthers are planning press events to push for a federal voting rights bill and a “compassionate federal budget.”\n\n“Our focus remains on driving down the high cost of living for everyday Americans and pushing back against the far-right extremism that Republicans have unleashed on the country,’’ Jeffries wrote.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nTrudeau: Trump justification for tariffs ‘completely bogus’\n\nCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday his country would hit back hard against U.S. tariffs, but it isn’t clear what President Donald Trump wanted to accomplish.\n\nTrump imposed the 25% tariff on Canadian imports by saying the country wasn’t doing enough to halt fentanyl trafficking. But Trudeau called the accusation “completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false” because tougher security measures in January resulted in just a half-ounce of the drug seized in January.\n\nTrudeau said Americans will lose jobs and find groceries, gas, cars and houses pricier in a trade war. Likewise, workers at Canadian carmakers are expecting layoffs within days.\n\n“What he wants is to see is a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us,” Trudeau said. “That will never happen. We will never be the 51st state.”\n\n“But he’s rapidly going to find out – as American families are going to find out – that it’s going to hurt people on both sides of the border,” Trudeau said.\n\nTrump said Tuesday afternoon that he would respond to any increases in Canadian tariffs with tariffs of the same amount.\n\n“Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump immigration policy 'something to celebrate': aide\n\nPresident Donald Trump accomplished the biggest turnaround in immigration policy in history by strengthening enforcement along the border and tracking down migrants who are in the country without legal authorization, according to a White House official.\n\nTrump is expected to tout his tough immigration policy during his speech to Congress. He sent troops to the southern border and declared drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations as part of a strategy that reduced border crossings by 95%, according to Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\n“You will never find an example of any law enforcement threat or national security threat where you have achieved such a rapid 180 in approach, strategy and results, and it is truly something to celebrate,” Miller told reporters outside the White House on Monday.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho attends the president's speech?\n\nIn addition to members of Congress and their guests, Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices, a group of people who are symbolic of the president's policies are invited to sit in the first lady's box.\n\nAmong the White House's guests this year are the family of Corey Comperatore, who was killed during an assassination attempt on Trump assassination at a campaign rally last summer in Butler, Pa. She is also hosting Allyson and Lauren Phillips, family members of Laken Riley, who was slain while on a jog in Athens, Ga. by a Venezuelan national in the country without authorization. Her death inspired the Laken Riley Act, the first bill Trump signed into law after returning to office.\n\nMarc and Malphine Fogel will also be in the first lady's box on Tuesday evening. Russia released American school teacher Marc Fogel, also of Pennsylvania, from prison in February, in a case that the U.S. said was wrongful detention. He will attend the speech with his mother, Malphine, who is 95.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho will deliver the Democratic response?\n\nFollowing Trump’s remarks, Michigan’s new senator, Elissa Slotkin, will give the Democratic response.\n\nSlotkin, who Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer described as “nothing short of a rising star,” was elected last November and took office in January. She is a former CIA analyst who served in Iraq and later worked in national security at the Pentagon and White House during the Bush and Obama administrations. She was elected to the House in 2018, flipping a seat previously occupied by a Republican.\n\nIn a statement previewing her remarks, Slotkin said the public expects its leaders to level with them on what’s happening in the country.\n\n\"From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out,” she said.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDemocrats warn of potential shutdown over GOP spending disputes\n\nThe head of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., told reporters Tuesday that Democrats don’t have the power to shut down government, but said disputes over Republican spending plans with President Donald Trump could lead to a shutdown on March 14.The House GOP narrowly approved a spending blueprint to cut government spending with the goal of approving Trump’s proposed tax cuts. But Democrats contend $880 billion in cuts targeted for the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid and Medicare, could lead to reduced health for lower-income Americans and retirees, which Republicans deny.\n\n“The American public will absolutely feel it,” Aguilar said of a potential shutdown. “We do not have the votes to keep government open,” he added, referring to Democrats.– Bart Jansen\n\nPreview of what's to come?\n\n“I will tell it like it is,” Trump promised late Tuesday morning in a message on social media.\n\nTrump responded on his social media platform to criticism of his tariffs, which went into effect in the early morning against key countries including Canada and Mexico.\n\n“If companies move to the United States, there are no tariffs!!!” he wrote in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump has been a staunch supporter of American manufacturing and has made it a centerpiece of his America First foreign policy.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nHouse Democrats say Trump can’t escape bad record in first month\n\nHouse Democrats told reporters Tuesday they would focus on the economy and health care in contrasting their vision for America with President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress.\n\nThe vice chair of the Democratic Caucus, Rep. Ted Lieu of California, said inflation has increased and consumer confidence is down since Trump took office. Stock prices fell with the midnight imposition of Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.\n\n“The stock market is tanking,” Lieu said. “He is harming America.”\n\n“He can’t escape the really bad record he’s already set forth,” Lieu added.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat time is Trump's speech to Congress?\n\nTrump is set to address Congress on Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including USA TODAY, ABC, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR and PBS, have announced plans to offer live coverage of the event.\n\nThe event will mark Trump's fifth presidential address to Congress.\n\nAlthough it's not a State of the Union, these speeches usually last just over one hour, sometimes due to intermittent applause from the audience throughout the address.\n\nAt least 200 guests typically attend presidential addresses. The president and first lady usually invite about two dozen people. Members of Congress and other officials also invite guests.\n\nThough an official guest list has not yet been released, one of Trump’s guests will be Frank Líma, a Los Angeles City fire captain who led crews fighting the massive Los Angeles fires in January, said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.\n\n– Natalie Neysa Alund, Javier Zarracina and George Petras\n\nWhy isn't Trump's speech a State of the Union address?\n\nSince Trump was sworn in less than two months ago, his speech won’t technically be a State of the Union address.\n\nThe State of the Union is an annual speech given by the president to Congress at the start of most calendar years, providing information on the current status and conditions in the United States. Typically, it is delivered to a joint session of Congress inside the House chamber.\n\nSeveral recent presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan, have delivered speeches in the months after their inauguration that serve the same purpose even though they aren’t formally considered a State of the Union address.\n\n– Natalie Neysa Alund", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/economy/inflation-history", "title": "This is the worst inflation in nearly 40 years. But it was so ... - CNN", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nUS prices for just about everything – from cars and gasoline to food and clothing – are rising at the fastest pace in decades.\n\nOverall, consumer prices rose in 2021 at the fastest pace in 39 years, meaning this is the worst inflation experienced by anyone not on the cusp of retirement or older.\n\nBut, as those older Americans can tell you, as unwelcome as it is for consumers, today’s price increases are nowhere near as bad as they were in the 1970s and early 1980s. And most importantly for policymakers trying to deal with today’s price hikes, what fed the double-digit prices increases in those days are not a factor today – nor are they likely to be ever again.\n\n“We learned our lessons from that experience,” said Louis Johnston, economics professor at College of Saint Benedict in Minnesota.\n\nPresidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, both tried and failed to bring prices under control. Ford’s efforts included a “Whip Inflation Now” or WIN campaign, complete with shiny red buttons, that did little to help with prices. Inflation hit 12.2% in late 1974, soon after he took office, nearly twice the annual pace of increase through November of last year.\n\nThe inflation rate hit a record high of 14.6% in March and April of 1980. It helped to lead to Carter’s defeat in that fall’s election. It also led to some significant changes in the US economy.\n\nToday the annual inflation rate stands at an unadjusted 7.1%, the highest 12-month change since June of 1982.\n\nHere’s some of the key factors different from today’s US economy and the economy of the 1980s:\n\nWages tied to prices\n\nOne of the major differences between inflation then and now is that a much greater percentage of the US population were unionized workers, and many of those workers had what was known as Cost of Living Adjustments, or COLAs, built into their contracts. That raised their wages automatically as prices increased. So higher prices led to higher wages, which put more money in the hands of consumers and raised costs for businesses. It created what was known as the “wage-price spiral” that fed higher prices.\n\nEven non-union employers would raise wages to keep pace with inflation or risk losing the workers to unionized employers – or risk giving an argument to union organizing campaigns at their companies.\n\nA close-up of a WIN (Whip Inflation Now) button, President Ford's symbol of the fight against inflation in 1974. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nToday, only about 12% of workers are represented by unions, about half the rate of 1983, the earliest year for which the government recorded that data. Today’s unionized workers are primarily government workers, such as teachers, police and firefighters. Only 7% of workers in the private sector are union members. And most of those don’t have COLA clauses in their contracts. During the extended period of low inflation over the past couple decades, unions were willing to give up COLAs in return for other improvements in wage and benefit.\n\nAbout the only widespread COLA now in effect is for Social Security recipients, and employers don’t feel a need set wages to compete with those benefits.\n\nWages are rising because of a record number of unfilled job openings and a shortage of workers. But even those wage increases are less than the rate of inflation, so it’s not likely to feed into higher prices.\n\nA global check on prices\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, higher costs could be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices more readily than now because competition from overseas imports wasn’t as great then as it is today.\n\nCompetition from overseas certainly existed then, but in many sectors of the economy, businesses only had to worry about domestic competitors. That’s not the case any longer.\n\nA surge in global trade has kept inflation in check in recent decades. Part of today’s inflation is being attributed to problems with the global supply chain, which has led to a worldwide increase shipping costs. So that has limited the supply of low-cost competition, which in turn has allowed even leading domestic companies to raise their prices as well.\n\nOil shocks hurt worse back then\n\nOne common factor between the record inflation of the 1970s and 1980s and today is rapidly surging energy prices.\n\nThe 1973 Arab-Israeli War prompted Arab members of OPEC to impose an embargo on oil shipments to the United States that lasted into 1974. And the Iran-Iraq war of 1979 choked off supply as well.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter giving a speech on the economy and inflation in March 1980. Chuck Fishman/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nThe limited supply sent prices soaring. Drivers were hit with a 69% increase in gas prices in early 1980 compared to a year earlier, which was even worse than the 58% annual increase through November of this year.\n\nThis time, large percentage increases in oil and gas prices are partly due to comparisons to the very low prices of 2020, when stay-at-home orders and widespread temporary job losses created a glut of oil, and temporarily resulted in negative oil prices.\n\nThose lower prices prompted producers to cut oil output, and some refineries to close. When demand returned this year, the tighter supply and strong demand combined to drive up prices.\n\nAlthough oil and gas prices could very possibly stay or climb even higher in the months ahead, the good news is that the US economy is much less dependent on oil today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.\n\nMoving from an economy built around energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing to one driven by service industries has reduced the relative dependence on oil.\n\n“One of the most overlooked changes is the reduced energy intensity of the American economy,” said Johnston.\n\nComparing total energy consumption to gross domestic product, the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity, shows the US economy uses about a third of the energy per inflation-adjusted dollar of economic activity that it did in 1970, and about 44% of what it used when inflation peaked in 1980.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s oil shocks significantly reduced oil as a source of fuel for electricity generation to the point where it is well less than 1% today. And more importantly, much more fuel-efficient cars also limited oil consumption despite many more miles being driven. That means Americans are spending far less on oil compared to other items.\n\nDeregulation\n\nAnother significant change in the US economy is that the government is much less involved in setting prices than it was then.\n\nDeregulation of industries such as telecommunications, airlines and trucking all started partly as a response to the high prices of the 1970s and 1980s, said Johnston. Government-controlled prices generally limited competition and kept prices and services offered to consumers artificially high.\n\nAlthough the actual changes in the law didn’t take effect until after the inflation dragon had been slayed, the deregulation has worked to keep prices for many of those goods and services lower than they likely would have been otherwise.\n\nInflation finally did come under control, thanks largely to the Federal Reserve under chairman Paul Volcker jacking up the federal funds rate to a record 18.9%, sparking recessions in both 1980 and another in 1981-82. By the time the second recession ended, the inflation rate was down to 4.5% and it wouldn’t hit 5% again until 1990.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union recap: Biden tells Americans economy roaring ...", "text": "Feb. 7, 2023 Updated Feb. 8, 2023, 8:14 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber. In a preview of an expected reelection campaign announcement, he noted that the unemployment rate was at 50-year low while inflation has been easing.\n\n“We’ve been sent here to finish the job,” Biden said, invoking a phrase he used several times in his speech.\n\nBut the rancorous atmosphere in the House chamber telegraphed fights ahead, including over budget priorities and avoiding a catastrophic default on the nation’s debt.

Also criticizing the president's foreign policy, Sanders said Biden is \"unfit\" to be Commander-in-Chief.\n\nCiting the Republican majority in the House, Sanders said: \"We will hold the Biden administration accountable.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden calls Paul Pelosi 'tough'\n\nBiden called out the political violence that was unleashed in the wake of Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.\n\n“With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is,” he said.\n\nBiden introduced Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was violently attacked in their home by an intruder, saying the assailant was “unhinged by the Big Lie” that the election was stolen.\n\n“Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.

Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment: New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon: Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far. In some states teachers make less than $50,000 on average.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nBiden urges lawmakers to protect abortion rights\n\nBiden called on lawmakers to “restore” abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n“The vice president and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety,” Biden said, noting that states across the country have implemented abortion bans and restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake about it. If Congress passes a national ban, I will veto it,” the president vowed.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden renews call to stand with Ukraine 'as long as it takes'\n\nCalling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a “test for the ages,” Biden said the U.S. passed that test by standing for sovereignty.\n\nThat matters, Biden said, because it “prevents open season for would-be aggressors.”\n\nHis argument – and promise to stand with Ukraine “as long as it takes” – comes as some Republicans are calling for greater scrutiny, or even a curtailment, of U.S. involvement.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine latest: Ukraine pushes to exclude Russia from 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nAmerica’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts, said Biden.\n\nSince launching a new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%, Biden said.\n\n“We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months,” he said.\n\nHe urged Congress to pass his plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. He also asked Congress to pave a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden highlights ‘courage’ of Brandon Tsay and calls for assault weapon bans\n\nBiden singled out Brandon Tsay’s heroism two weeks ago when he disarmed the Monterey Park shooter who killed 11 people who attended a Chinese Lunar New Year celebration. Tsay, who is in attendance, received a standing ovation from lawmakers as Biden acknowledged him.\n\n“He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high': Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a fervent opponent of Biden who has called for his impeachment, yelled at him twice during the State of the Union address.\n\nThe first time came as Biden said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare – an accusation that Greene refuted when she stood up yelled “Liar!”\n\nGreene later yelled, “China spied on us!” near the end of Biden’s speech.\n\nShe also yelled to “close the border” and “it’s your fault” when the president talked about the fentanyl crisis.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nState of the Union guests: Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden on Tyre Nichols’ death: ‘Something good must come from this’\n\nBiden used his speech to pay tribute to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBiden called for more police training and more resources to reduce violent crime, along with more investments in housing, education and training.\n\nNoting that Nichols’ mother and stepfather were seated in the first lady’s box, Biden urged lawmakers to commit themselves to making the words of Nichols’ mother come true: “Something good must come from this.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden invokes Uvalde massacre in call for gun reform\n\nIn a call to action on gun violence, Biden invoked his trip to Uvalde, Texas, after the Robb Elementary School shooting where 19 students and two teachers were killed.\n\n“Do something, do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde, I met with everyone.” Biden said, then pointing to the bipartisan gun reform law he signed. “Thank god we did. Passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCOVID is under control but vigilance necessary, says Biden\n\nWhile COVID-19 deaths are down nearly 90%, and the end of the public health emergency is close, Biden said the country will remember the pain of losing loved ones will never go away for many.\n\n“Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.

That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year: How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?: Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight: How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests: Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov.

Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech: Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy: A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/01/21/bitcoin-trump-coin-slide-inauguration/77850374007/", "title": "Bitcoin and Trump meme coin slide after inauguration - USA Today", "text": "Tom Westbrook\n\nReuters\n\nJan. 21, 2025, 1:11 p.m. ET\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and even the newly minted token bearing Donald Trump's name recoiled on Tuesday, after the U.S. president's first set of policies following inauguration made no reference to this asset class.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, BTC= hit a record high $109,071 on Monday when Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. President, but later pared those gains and was last trading at $101,705.40.\n\nThe Trump-branded meme coin, launched on Friday night, was last trading at $34.4, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. That is half its peak price of $74.59 on Monday, when valuation exceeded $14 billion. The coin had initially been priced around $6.5 at its launch.\n\nTrump's inaugural speech on Monday was accompanied by a host of executive orders and plans relating to trade tariffs, immigration, energy deregulation and even a reprieve for popular Chinese short-video app TikTok.\n\nBut he did not mention cryptocurrencies, disappointing an industry that had for months been excited the crypto-friendly president would kick-start a sea change in U.S. policies towards the volatile asset class.\n\n\"I think in the short term there's a chance this could be a sell-the-news event,\" said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Astronaut Capital, adding that crypto investors had been anticipating some executive actions to be rolled out during Trump's first day in office.\n\n\"The market has some great expectations about a bitcoin strategic reserve and a loosening of regulations around digital assets, but it's more likely these developments will be drip-fed over a series of months rather than days. Bitcoin has already retreated ... We are expecting further volatility here and likely a selloff,\" Dibb said.\n\nCrypto exchange-traded funds sold off too. The ChinaAMC bitcoin ETF 83042.HK shed nearly 6%.\n\nHowever, Trump has already set in motion personnel changes that the industry sees as encouraging.\n\nHe has tapped Mark Uyeda, a Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to be acting chair of the agency and plans to nominate former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to run the agency on a permanent basis.\n\nAtkins is widely expected to end a crypto crackdown led by former President Joe Biden's Democratic SEC chair Gary Gensler and Uyeda has criticized the SEC for failing to offer guidance on how crypto companies can register with the agency.\n\nTop Republican officials at the SEC are poised to begin overhauling the agency's cryptocurrency policies potentially as early as next week, said three people briefed on the matter.\n\nConflict of interest\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's launch of the $TRUMP token and the $MELANIA token, for first lady Melania Trump, shortly before his inauguration creates new conflict-of-interest concerns, ethics experts and industry insiders said.\n\nEighty percent of Trump coin's tokens are owned by CIC Digital, an affiliate of Trump's business, and another entity called Fight, Fight, Fight, according to its website.\n\nThe companies said they are not investments or securities but are an \"expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol '$TRUMP'\".\n\nWorld Liberty Financial, a separate Trump-linked crypto project, also announced on Monday that it had completed an initial token sale, raising $300 million, and would look to issue additional tokens.\n\nTrump has pledged to hand management of his assets to his children, but the crypto asset is raising particular concerns due to its ability to quickly attract billions of speculative dollars with little transparency.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Lang and Michelle Conlin in New York, Elizabeth Howcroft in Paris, Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore; Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columns/2025/03/13/donald-trump-hit-a-home-run-with-congressional-speech-phil-williams/82236096007/", "title": "Trump's speech showed sharp contrast with Biden | PHIL WILLIAMS", "text": "Phil Williams\n\nContributor\n\nMarch 13, 2025, 4:46 a.m. ET\n\nI’m a fan of great speeches.

But they've also increased costs for businesses and consumers. And they've raised questions about whether Trump has unconstitutionally taken from Congress the key power to raise revenue.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the case, the biggest the court has agreed to hear so far this term.\n\nWho is challenging the tariffs?\n\nTrump’s tariffs are being challenged by multiple small businesses and by a dozen states with Democratic attorneys general.\n\nThe businesses include an Illinois-based company that sells educational toys and a wine-importing company based in New York City. Learning Resources, which makes a majority of its toys in China, says the tariffs could cost the company $100 million this year, compared with the $2.3 million in import fees it paid last year.\n\nThe states suing are: Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Vermont. Their attorneys general say the tariffs have “wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy,” and raised the cost of goods the states purchase.\n\nWhat tariffs are being challenged?\n\nTwo types of tariffs Trump imposed since beginning his second term are being challenged. One set is the reciprocal tariffs the president imposed on almost all goods imported into the U.S. to address the trade deficit. He’s said those import fees will raise billions of dollars for the government and bring manufacturing back to the United States.\n\nThe other tariffs at issue are the fees imposed on imports from Mexico, Canada and China that Trump is using as leverage to get those countries to do more to stop fentanyl from coming into the U.S.\n\nWhy are the tariffs controversial?\n\nTrump is the first president to try to use a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose broad tariffs, a move that sidesteps a more complex and limited tariffs process set in other laws.\n\nThe IEEPA allows presidents to “regulate…importation or exportation” of “property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest” in order “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat” to the nation.\n\nIt's typically been used to freeze a foreign countries' assets in the U.S. or to completely block trade with a country. For example, President Jimmy Carter used IEEPA to freeze Iranian government assets to try to win the release of 52 Americans during the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.\n\nWhat do the challengers say?\n\nThe challengers argue Trump is stretching the word “regulate” beyond its plain meaning. There’s no indication that Congress intended to give presidents such expansive taxing authority, they say. And the Supreme Court has said in recent years the executive branch can’t take actions with a major economic or political impact without clear authorization from Congress.\n\n\"Indeed, if `regulate' meant `tax,' the President, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could taxeverything from autos to zoos,\" lawyers for some of the businesses argued in a filing.\n\nEven if that’s what lawmakers intended, they contend, granting a president that much power over a form of taxing – a responsibility the Founding Fathers gave to Congress – is unconstitutional.\n\nThe challengers also argue that trade deficits, which the nation has run since 1975, don't qualify as an emergency that could trigger IEEPA.\n\nWhat is the Trump administration's position?\n\nThe administration argues that because the IEEPA gives presidents the power to block imports from a country, it must also allow him to tax imports since that’s a less extreme form of “regulating” imports.\n\nThe administration also said Congress is allowed to delegate major authority to presidents to address emergencies – particularly those related to foreign affairs. Congress clearly did so in this case, the administration contends, and lawmakers still have oversight authority they can use if they think the president has gone too far. (Congressional Republicans have rejected Democratic lawmakers' attempts to intervene.)\n\nSustained trade deficits are an \"economic and national-security\" emergency because they have \"fostered dependency on foreign rivals and gutted American manufacturing,\" the Justice Department told the court in a filing.\n\n\"If a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs, we would be defenseless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\nHow did the lower courts rule?\n\nThree courts have sided with the challengers, although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was divided.\n\nFour of the seven appeals court judges said the IEEPA doesn’t allow tariffs. Three judges said the law allows presidents to impose some tariffs but not those as sweeping as Trump’s. And four said tariffs are a valid use of the law.\n\nHow is the Supreme Court likely to rule?\n\nExperts say the case sets up a possible clash between conservative positions.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has favored giving the president broad executive authority, especially in areas that touch on national security or foreign affairs. But the court has also been receptive to conservative arguments that Congress can’t give too much of its power to the executive branch. And when it does give substantial decision-making authority, it must do so clearly. That was the basis for the court’s rejection of some of President Joe Biden’s policies that he justified because of “emergencies.”\n\nHow has the Supreme Court ruled on other Trump policies?\n\nThis is the first time a challenge to a policy Trump enacted in his second term is getting a full hearing at the Supreme Court. Until now, the justices have issued interim decisions about whether Trump’s policies can remain in effect as they’re being litigated. In those case, Trump has been overwhelmingly successful.\n\nWill Trump attend the oral arguments?\n\nThe president had said he might make history as the first sitting president to attend a high court hearing because the case is so important. But he later ruled out an appearance, telling reporters on Nov. 2 that he does not \"want to do anything to deflect the importance\" of the decision.\n\nInstead, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will attend. Bessent told Fox News his appearance will \"emphasize that this is an economic emergency.\"\n\nWhen is a decision expected?\n\nWhile the Supreme Court can take months to decide its biggest cases, they may try to rule faster on the tariffs. That’s in part because the longer they’re in place, the more money the government will collect that it may have to refund. The justices are also aware that the uncertainty about the tariffs is making it hard for affected businesses to plan.\n\nDoes Trump have a backup plan?\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules against Trump, there are other laws he can use to impose tariffs. But those require a more detailed process, can be used in more limited circumstances and would eliminate some of the uncertainty for businesses by giving them notice of what’s coming.\n\nHow have the tariffs affected businesses and households?\n\nTrump has argued that countries wanting to sell their goods to Americans will absorb the import taxes to remain in the world’s largest consumer market.\n\nBut independent analysts, including at Goldman Sachs and S&P Global, have estimated U.S. consumers and businesses are shouldering much of the cost.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, estimates the tariffs amount to an average tax increase of $1,300 per household in 2025.\n\nWhat does the public think?\n\nSix in 10 Americans disapprove of the tariffs, according to an August survey by the Pew Research Center.\n\nMajorities of Americans think the long-term effects will be mostly negative both for the country (55%) and for themselves and their families (55%).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/04"}]}

Sweden's Ebba Andersson won the women's race, while record-breaking Norwegian Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo won the men's race.\n\nVerona Arena\n\nThe closing ceremony for the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games are being held at the iconic Verona Olympic Arena, which is located in Verona, Italy — roughly two hours away from Milan and roughly three hours from Cortina d'Ampezzo, the two host cities of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Verona Olympic Arena is the third-largest Roman amphitheater in Italy, and was built in 30 AD to host gladiator battles. — John Leuzzi\n\nOlympics rings\n\nThe Olympic Rings are five interlocking rings – blue, black, red, yellow and green – createdby Pierre de Coubertin in 1913. They are symbolic of the unity of the five inhabited continents and the coming together of athletes from all over the world. They were presented at the 1914 Olympic Congress in Paris and first displayed at the 1920 Antwerp Games.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is the five rings themselves that represent the five continents, not the colors of these rings. In fact, the six colors represented on the Olympic Flag – which includes the white background – werechosen because at least one of these colors can be seen on the flag of every nation.\n\nClosing ceremony broadcasters\n\nNBC's broadcasters for the closing ceremony are Terry Gannon, Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, along with reporters Andrea Joyce and Lewis Johnson.\n\nAlysa Liu on her future\n\nThe NBC crew caught up with Team USA star Alysa Liu, who won two gold medals at these Games, and asked her about her future in figure skating.\n\n\"I have no plans to leave yet,\" she said. \"I can't imagine not skating next year.\"\n\nLiu had previously called competing at the 2022 Beijing Games \"a job,\" but said the Milano Cortina Games were \"definitely not a job.\"\n\n\"I just feel so lucky that I get to do this, and I love being an athlete. It's the coolest thing in the world,\" she said.\n\nWho is Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo?\n\nNorway's Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo is the new record-holder for most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Klaebo won all six of the events in which he competed. Klaebo won the 50km mass start classic, 10km + 10km skiathlon, sprint classic, 10 km interval start free, 4 × 7.5km relay and team sprint free.\n\nWhy does Greece go first at Olympics?\n\nIt's tradition! Greece is the birthplace of the Olympic Games and holds this honor at every Olympics.\n\n\"It was at Amsterdam 1928 that the tradition of the Greek delegation marching first was introduced – owing to the status of the founding country of the ancient Olympic Games,\" the official Olympics website reads.\n\nOlympic flame arrives\n\nThe Flame, the very one that lit the cauldrons in Milano and Cortina after a 12,000 km journey, has arrived inVerona. Indeed, into the Verona. It's time for the Olympic athletes to enter the arena.\n\nWho is playing the Italian anthem?\n\nPaolo Fresu, one of the world’s most influential trumpeters, begins the Italian anthem as the flag is hooked to the flag pole and raised. Fresu has recorded more than 500 albums since the 1980s.\n\nThe Choir of the Fondazione Arena di Verona sings from the Teatro Filarmonico, the second venue for thisceremony.\n\nCelebrating Italy\n\nThe Italian flag arrives and the anthem of Italy is played.\n\nInside the Teatro Filarmonico\n\nThe Teatro Filarmonico di Verona is one of Italy’s leading opera houses, and features performances by the Choirand Orchestra of the Fondazione Arena di Verona, which has presented opera, ballet and symphonic music for more than 50 years.\n\nThe theater is owned by the Accademia Filarmonica, founded in 1543, the oldest active musical institution in Europe. The theater opened on Jan. 6, 1732 with Antonio Vivaldi’s La Fida Ninfa. It was rebuilt and reopened after a fire in 1754, it also hosted Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Destroyed by bombing in 1945, it was rebuilt to faithfully reflect its original layout.\n\nClosing ceremony opens at the opera\n\nThe closing ceremony begins with a behind the scenes look at the world of the opera, with characters spilling out to the arena to welcome the athletes. Iconic characters such as Rigoletto, Figaro, Aida and Madama Butterfly perform.\n\nWhat time is Olympics closing ceremony?\n\nThe closing ceremony for the 2026 Winter Olympics begins at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere to watch Olympics closing ceremony?\n\nNBC is broadcasting the closing ceremony, and Peacock is live streaming it.\n\nUSA flag bearers for closing ceremony\n\nHilary Knight and Evan Bates have been chosen as Team USA's flag bearers for the 2026 Winter Olympics closing ceremony on Sunday.\n\nKnight is the captain of the gold-medal-winning U.S. women's hockey team, and her third-period goal against Canada ended up sending the game into overtime, where Megan Keller’s goal four minutes into the extra period gave the U.S. a 2-1 victory and their third gold medal in the event.\n\n\"I’m so, so honored to be part of this team. You guys are all so wonderful. And I think I can speak for Evan and myself when I say we are all so proud of everything you guys have accomplished and the people that you are and the people that you’ve become to be here today,\" Knight said.\n\nBates also won a gold medal in the figure skating team event and another silver medal in ice dance with his partner and wife, Madison Chock.\n\nClosing ceremony flag bearers\n\nGreece:

over?\n\nTechnically, no. The closing ceremony will mark the official end to the Milano Cortina Games. However, there are no more events on the schedule. Competition ended with Team USA's 2-1 overtime win against Canada in the men's ice hockey gold medal game.\n\nWhy are so many countries skipping the closing ceremony?\n\nThere’s going to be even fewer athletes at the closing ceremony than usual.\n\nTwenty-eight of the 92 countries at 2026 Milano Cortina Games won’t have an athlete flagbearer because none of their athletes will be at the ceremony. Another 35 will have only one flagbearer because they won’t any athletes of the other gender present.\n\nThe United States will have both flagbearers, hockey captain Hilary Knight and ice dancer Evan Bates.\n\nWhile not having enough athletes to be flagbearers is a bit out of the ordinary, it’s also not necessarily a surprise. The closing ceremony always has a smaller athlete contingent because so many leave when their events are over. That’s especially true at the Winter Games, because many World Cup circuits resume a few days after the Olympics end and several sports have world championships within the next month.\n\nThe women’s Alpine speed skiers, for example, have a race on Friday, Feb. 27. The speed skating world championships begin March 5.\n\nBut the widespread footprint of these Games also makes it difficult for athletes in the mountain clusters to get to Verona, site of the closing ceremony.\n\nIt’s a four-hour plus trip from Livigno to Verona, and three hours from Cortina. Both sites had events earlier Sunday – the women’s freeski halfpipe final was in Livigno while the women’s curling gold medal game and four-man bobsled were in Cortina – making it near-impossible for those athletes to make it to closing in time.\n\nFor countries that don’t have a male or female athlete available to be a flagbearer, a volunteer will carry the flag. For those that only have either a male or female athlete, there will only be one flagbearer. — Nancy Armour\n\nOlympic closing ceremony time\n\nThe closing ceremony for the 2026 Winter Olympics begins at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWho won men's ice hockey gold medal game?\n\nTeam USA beat Canada 2-1 in overtime to earn its first gold medal in men's hockey since the \"Miracle on Ice\" in 1980.\n\nWho is Johnny Gaudreau?\n\nJohnny Gaudreau was a former NHL star who was on track to play for the United States during these 2026 Winter Olympics. Unfortunately Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, died in a cycling accident in New Jersey on Aug. 29, 2024, after the pair were struck by a drunk driver.\n\nThe U.S. men's hockey team paid homage to him throughout the tournament, hanging his jersey in their locker room. Gaudreau's family members were also in attendance for Sunday's gold medal game, and when Jack Hughes scored the golden goal in overtime, the Americans wasted no time parading Gaudreau's jersey around the ice, honoring him as part of the championship team. — Jon Hoefling\n\nJack Hughes teeth\n\nTeam USA men's ice hockey hero Jack Hughes slapped the game-winning goal in the gold medal game against Canada, but his ear-to-ear smile was missing something in the postgame celebration.\n\nHughes lost two teeth after he took a high stick to the mouth from Canada's Sam Bennett in the third period, which drew blood and kept Hughes down on the ice for a few moments.\n\n\"My first thought was, I looked down on the ice and saw my teeth,\" Hughes said, giving media members a big toothless grin on Sunday. \"Like, here we go again... I know the last time that happened, wasn't really fun.\" — Cydney Henderson, Steve Gardner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/salt-lake-city-host-2034-winter-olympics/74239222007/", "title": "2034 Winter Olympics will be back in Salt Lake City. What to know", "text": "Updated July 24, 2024, 1:08 p.m. ET\n\nPARIS − The Winter Olympics are officially returning to the United States.\n\nMore specifically, the Games are coming back to Utah.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee members voted Wednesday to formally award the 2034 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, making Utah's capital a repeat Olympic host more than three decades after it served as the site of the 2002 Olympics. It will be the fifth time the U.S. has hosted the Winter Games.\n\n\"We are ready. Everything is in place,\" Fraser Bullock, leader of Salt Lake City's bid committee, said in a presentation at the IOC session Wednesday. \"But beyond our physical assets, you can count on our people. As great as our venues are, our people are even better.\"\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nWednesday's vote was essentially a rubber stamp; Salt Lake City already had been handpicked by the committee as the best option for 2034. Though it did come with a bit of unexpected controversy − a strange scene in which committee members used the moment to rip the United States for its recent political actions around the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the controversial doping case involving 23 Chinese swimmers.\n\n\"I'm sorry for you, and for us, that this issue arose now,\" IOC president Thomas Bach told Salt Lake's bid committee.\n\nUltimately, though, the last-minute concerns were never going to be enough to derail Wednesday's vote, which passed 83-6. The news prompted celebration in the early morning hours back in Utah, where the committee 's vote coincided with a state holiday, Pioneer Day.\n\nMembers also signed off on the French Alps as host of the 2030 Winter Games earlier in the day.\n\nIOC airs concerns over U.S. stance on anti-doping\n\nIn the hour before the vote to award the Winter Games to Salt Lake City, they took an uncommon detour to express concerns about how a doping scandal involving Chinese swimmers has been handled in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and its chief executive officer, Travis Tygart, have been extremely critical of WADA's handling of the Chinese swimmers case, in which 23 athletes tested positive for a banned heart medication ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Games. WADA accepted the results of a Chinese government investigation that attributed the positive tests to contamination at a hotel and neither publicly disclosed the tests at the time.\n\nUSADA's criticism has been followed by a congressional hearing and a reported investigation by U.S. law enforcement, apparently under the auspices of the Rodchenkov Act, which allows U.S. authorities to pursue criminal charges in doping cases that affect U.S. athletes.\n\nIt is the Rodchenkov Act, in particular, that seemed to prompt the ire of IOC members ahead of Wednesday's vote. And John Coates, one of Bach's top lieutenants, said the committee went so far as to amend Salt Lake's host city contract to address the matter. According to Coates, the IOC can terminate the host contract if \"the supreme authority of (WADA) in the fight against doping is not fully respected.\"\n\nGene Sykes, who chairs the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, responded to the members' concerns by praising WADA and renewing the United States' commitment to clean sport.\n\n\"We certainly accept the obligations and responsibility inherent in the amendment to the Olympic host contract,\" Sykes said. \"So from our perspective, we take very seriously to heart all of your comments, and we pledge to you that we will be good partners and we will support, with you, this very, very important institution.\"\n\nSalt Lake's road to becoming 2034 Olympic host\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has supported Salt Lake City as a host candidate since 2018, and it has been clear for several years now that the IOC would award Utah another version of the Games at some point.\n\nFor a time, the only realistic question was whether Salt Lake would host the Winter Games in 2030 or 2034.\n\nBid leaders said they would be open to either but preferred 2034 to allow for more of a cushion after the United States' hosting of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThe city is uniquely positioned as a host in part because it has meticulously maintained the venues that were used in 2002 through the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit created after those Games. Olympic officials also value Salt Lake City's reliable winter climate. Because of climate change, fewer cities can be counted upon to have the ideal weather for hosting the Winter Games during their usual scheduling slot in early to mid-February.\n\nWhat are the proposed venues for Salt Lake 2034?\n\nThe Salt Lake Games will use 12 existing venues, only four of which will require additional and permanent upgrades before 2034, according a report released in June by the IOC's future host commission. The only temporary venue that will need to be built is for snowboard big air.\n\nAs for the big-ticket items, the University of Utah's campus is expected to double as the Olympic village during the Games, and the Delta Center − home to the NBA's Utah Jazz − will host one of the Winter Olympics' marquee sports, figure skating. Skiing events will be held at Snowbasin Resort, about 35 minutes northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, and snowboarding events will be in Park City.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nHow much will Salt Lake City Olympics cost?\n\nKarl Stoss, chair of the future host commission for the Winter Games, has praised Salt Lake's plan for the Games as \"very compact\" and said it would require no capital investment.\n\nThe Salt Lake Games have an official budget of about $4 billion, and organizers claim they will be 100% privately funded − pulling money from ticket revenue, domestic sponsorships and an IOC contribution. The Olympics, however, have a habit of stretching beyond initial estimates. And they tend to put additional strain on public works and utilities in the host city, which is sometimes underestimated in budgets.\n\nWhich other bids did the U.S. beat out?\n\nFor decades, the IOC welcomed bids from multiple countries for one edition of the Games and essentially let them duke it out for votes. But that's not how it works anymore. The IOC's host selection process is far more amorphous, with potential hosts progressing through several loose stages of \"dialogue\" so that by the time they are put up for a vote, like Salt Lake City was Wednesday, the decision has essentially already been made.\n\nThat's all to say that it's not super-clear which bids, if any, Salt Lake City beat out. It was in the mix with the French Alps, Sweden and Switzerland for potential hosting duties, while Canada and Japan also expressed some level of interest. Ultimately, the IOC appears to have picked the French Alps and Salt Lake City from the bunch and then just figured out the timing of who would host when.\n\nWhere are the next Olympic Games?\n\nHere's a quick rundown of future Olympic hosts.\n\n2026 : Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy\n\n: Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy 2028: Summer Olympics in Los Angeles\n\nSummer Olympics in Los Angeles 2030: Winter Olympics in the French Alps\n\nWinter Olympics in the French Alps 2032: Summer Olympics in Brisbane, Australia\n\nSummer Olympics in Brisbane, Australia 2034: Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/08/winter-olympics-live-updates-results-today/88569801007/", "title": "Winter Olympics highlights: Malinin and US earn gold medal", "text": "Updated Feb. 8, 2026, 8:59 p.m. ET\n\nMILAN — The 2026 Winter Olympics rolled into another packed day Sunday, Feb. 8, with all eyes on Lindsey Vonn. But the excitement quickly turned to concern when Vonn suffered a major crash in the women's downhill. The 41-year-old was competing with a torn ACL.\n\nVonn caught a gate with her right arm, which caused her to spin around. Her legs went akimbo and her weight was too far back on her skis to recover. She tumbled on her side and then somersaulted. The crash happened about 13 to 14 seconds into the run. Vonn could be heard wailing in pain, and a helicopter was on the scene to transport her for care.\n\nTeam USA did secure a pair of gold medals on Feb. 8, however. Breezy Johnson won the United States' first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics after taking the downhill skiing event, before Ilia Malinin's impressive 200.03 showing in the men's free skate portion of the team event narrowly edged out Japan, which took silver.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought highlights and news live from around the Olympics on Feb. 8. Take a look:\n\nTeam USA reacts to winning gold in ice skating team event\n\nHere's a look at Team USA's full reaction after finding out it won gold in the ice-skating team event on Feb. 8:\n\nIlia Malinin wins gold medal for Team USA\n\nIlia Malinin, the \"Quad God,\" scores a 200.03 in the men's free skate portion of the team event, which secures the gold medal for the United States in the team ice skating event. Malinin didn't attempt a Quad Axel but nonetheless capped off the impressive run with a quad Salchow, triple axel and a one-footed backflip.\n\nJapan's Shun Sato scores a personal-best 194.02 in the following routine, which comes up short of Malinin's score. Team USA (69 points) takes gold in the team event for the second consecutive Olympics, with Japan (68 points) taking silver and Italy (60 points) with bronze.\n\nTeam USA consisted of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu, Madison Chock, Evan Bates, Elle Kam, Danny O'Shea and Malinin.\n\nAmber Glenn shocked by 'outlandish backlash' to comments about LGBTQ community\n\nMILAN — Amber Glenn said she \"couldn't believe the outlandish backlash\" she received for speaking out about LGBTQ issues in the United States.\n\nThe first-time Olympian figure skater revealed her feelings about the response to her comments after Team USA won team event gold on Sunday, Feb. 8.\n\n\"I couldn't believe the outlandish backlash I received for just supporting people,\" she said. \"Of course, I have people supporting me, and I'm not online right now because of it, but I'm gonna keep speaking my truth. I'm gonna keep representing what I believe in and what I think all Americans believe in, which is freedom and being able to love and do what you want. So, I just I hope we can keep going forward and be positive.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTeam USA misses women's big air final\n\nLIVIGNO, Italy – The United States won't have an entrant in the women's big air snowboarding final, as all three Americans failed to match together two runs strong enough make it out of evening qualifying on Feb. 8 at Livigno Snow Park.\n\nOut of the 29 competitors in the field, the top 12 qualified for the final on the basis of three runs, with the best two scores counting.\n\nTeam USA's Lily Dhawornvej, at only 16 years old, finished 20th after opening with a stellar 83.75. But from there, she didn't fare better than a 58 on two shaky jumps, ending up with a 141.75 total, shy of the 153.50 cut line.\n\nSimilarly, USA teammate Hahna Norman scored an 82 on her second attempt, but crashed on her third, shrugging on screen as she awaited a score that wouldn't be enough to advance. Norman ended up 28th with a 93.50 total.\n\nThe last remaining American hopeful, Jessica Perlmutter, went into her final run needing a big score to boost an opening 77. But she also couldn't land her jump, falling face-first to place 23th with a 132.25.\n\nZoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand took first in the qualifying with a 172.25, scoring at least an 82.25 on all three runs.\n\n– Gentry Estes, Nashville Tennessean\n\nAmber Glenn makes 2026 Winter Olympics debut in team event\n\nAmber Glenn, the No. 3-ranked figure skater in the world, was a bit shaky in her figure skating team event routine, although she still managed to score a 138.62, which ranks third among women single skaters in the event.\n\nHer score keeps Team USA tied-for first place of the team event standings with Japan heading into the men's free skate portion, where Ilia Malinin will compete.

Heavy rain, 60 mph winds likely", "text": "Updated Oct. 13, 2025, 10:11 a.m. ET\n\nASHEVILLE, NC — A powerful nor'easter may wreak havoc on the East Coast, slamming the Carolinas and prompting emergency declarations in New York and New Jersey.\n\nMarking the first nor'easter of the season, the coastal storm is known for strong and dangerous waves, high winds, and heavy rainfall. In previous nor'easter events, the Outer Banks experienced severe beach erosion, coastal flooding, and dangerous surf conditions — sometimes literally knocking down homes and washing away sections of roadway.\n\nAs the storm tracks north, forecasters warn it could bring similar hazards to coastal communities from Virginia to Massachusetts, including power outages, travel disruptions, and marine dangers with seas topping 10 feet, according to the National Weather Service office.\n\nThe exact track will determine which regions see the heaviest impacts, but residents along the East Coast should prepare for worsening conditions. A dry high-pressure system is expected to move in, bringing calmer weather and milder temperatures to North Carolina on Oct. 12 and Oct. 13.\n\n\"A coastal low will lift north along the Carolina coast through the weekend,\" the National Weather Service office wrote in an area forecast. \"This system may bring rain to the North Carolina Piedmont and eastern Upstate late Saturday through Sunday as it passes by to our east. The low will continue to slowly track northeast along the Mid-Atlantic Coast early next week, with dry high pressure and above normal temperatures returning to the region.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a state of emergency for New York City, Long Island, and Westchester due to the ongoing storm, urging residents to prepare and stay vigilant.\n\n\"We’re ready to assist local partners as damaging winds and heavy rain move in, with the potential for flooding and power outages,\" Hochul said on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, acting Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency for New Jersey due to the impending nor'easter, making available a wide array of state resources to help local communities cope with extreme weather events.\n\n\"I am declaring a State of Emergency effective Saturday at 10 p.m. as we anticipate a coastal storm that will bring flash flooding, heavy rain, and damaging winds,\" Way said on social media.\n\nWhat time is the nor'easter going to hit?\n\nIn New Jersey, the worst of the current n’oreaster is yet to come, according to meteorologists, who said the rain impact is expected to be less than initially thought, while the gusty winds and coastal flooding will worsen through the night.\n\n“We are not even at the peak of this storm, which will be between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,” said Steven DeMartino, owner and chief meteorologist at NYNJPA Weather. “The primary influences of the storm will maximize with winds sustained at 15-30 mph, gusts up to 40 mph and higher.\"\n\nHe added that “the wind will continue through the low tides and the high tides. It has been a very choppy seas.“\n\nWhat is a nor'easter?\n\nA nor’easter is a storm along the East Coast of North America that typically blows over coastal areas. These storms can occur at any time of year but are most frequent and most intense between September and April, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nNor’easters usually develop between Georgia and New Jersey, within about 100 miles of the coast, and generally move northeastward, reaching maximum intensity near New England and the Canadian Maritime Provinces. They often bring heavy precipitation — rain or snow — along with gale-force winds, rough seas and sometimes coastal flooding.\n\nPotential storm impacts include heavy rain reducing visibility and creating flooding in coastal and low-lying areas; strong winds that pose risk for power outages and downed trees; marine hazards; and rip currents.\n\nHow much rain is expected? Rain forecast totals across the East Coast\n\nThese are the estimated rainfall amounts for regions affected by the nor'easter on the East Coast through Tuesday, Oct. 14.\n\nEastern North Carolina to Southern Virginia:\n\n2.5 to 5 inches\n\nCore areas near the coast show even 5 to 7 inches\n\nMid-Atlantic Coast\n\n3 to 5 inches, especially near the coast\n\nSome isolated coastal pockets appear to approach 6+ inches\n\nNew York (Downstate and Long Island)\n\n2 to 4 inches, heavier near the coast\n\nSouthern New England (Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts)\n\n2 to 4 inches, locally higher amounts possible near the southeast-facing coast\n\nEastern Pennsylvania & Upstate New York (east side)\n\n1 to 2.5 inches, tapering westward\n\nCoastal Southeast (South Carolina and Georgia):\n\n1 to 3 inches, heaviest near the northern part of the South Carolina coast\n\nWhy is it called nor'easter?\n\nIt’s called a nor’easter because of the direction of the prevailing winds during the storm. In these systems, the winds along the coast usually blow from the northeast.\n\nHow do nor’easters develop?\n\nThe U.S. East Coast provides an ideal environment for nor’easters. In winter, the polar jet stream pushes cold Arctic air south across Canada and the U.S., then east toward the Atlantic Ocean, according to the National Weather Service. At the same time, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic moves northward.\n\nThe contrast between the cold land air and relatively warm coastal waters — kept mild by the Gulf Stream — fuels these storms, creating the strong winds and precipitation that define a nor’easter.\n\nDo nor’easters always have snow?\n\nNo. Whether a nor’easter brings snow, rain, or a mix depends on the storm’s track and temperatures:\n\nSnow: Most common in the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England when Arctic air dominates.\n\nMost common in the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England when Arctic air dominates. Rain: More likely in the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic, where temperatures are warmer.\n\nMore likely in the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic, where temperatures are warmer. Mixed precipitation: Possible in areas near the transition zone, with sleet or freezing rain.\n\nEven without snow, Nor’easters can still produce strong winds, heavy rain, rough seas and coastal flooding, making them dangerous storms regardless of the type of precipitation.\n\nHow do they differ from tropical systems? Nor'easters vs. hurricanes and tropical storms\n\nNor'easters are typically associated with colder seasons and form from a temperature contrast between cold Arctic air and relatively warm Atlantic waters. Tropical storms and hurricanes form over warm tropical or subtropical waters, and predominantly develop in warmer months.\n\nNor'easters also have a larger wind field, while tropical storms have a well-defined eye with the strongest winds near the center.\n\nContributing: Joe Strupp, Asbury Park Press; Lucas Frau, Kristie Cattafi, and David M.

Its exact path isn't certain, but it is expected to dump several inches of snow across the Plains region and ice in Texas and the Carolinas, the outlet reported.\n\nOn Jan. 21, more than 110 million Americans were under extreme winter weather watches, warnings or advisories, including blizzard warnings, winter storm warnings, high wind warnings, extreme cold warnings and more. Fifty-seven million people were under winter storm watches in states including Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Alabama and Tennessee.

Gusty winds will make already frigid temperatures even more dangerous.\n\nThe Northern Plains region could see wind chill temperatures of minus 50 degrees this week, the coldest in the country. In Chicago, the high temperatures could struggle to get above zero, AccuWeather reported.\n\nWind chill, also called apparent temperature, is a \"feels like\" measurement designed to help people understand the dangers of exposure to cold temperatures.

The northern half of the storm, which includes portions of Texas and the Carolinas, will bring heavy snow, while the southern half will see freezing rain across much of the Deep South.\n\nThe storm's exact path and timing are still unclear, so snowfall totals could have some variability, forecasters said, but snow that falls won't quickly melt due to low temperatures. Between 6 and 12 inches of snow is possible across the heart of the Plains region, with 2 feet in parts of the Appalachians, AccuWeather reported.\n\nThe weather service in Nashville said there are chances for up to a foot of snow north of Interstate 40, while up to half an inch of ice is possible south of the interstate.\n\nSee snowfall totals nationwide\n\nStay up-to-date on how much snow falls by checking USA TODAY's snowfall tracker:\n\nFollow these tips to stay safe in the cold\n\nChances of frostbite and hypothermia will rise sharply by the weekend.\n\nWhat’s the coldest wind chill on record in the U.S.?\n\nThe coldest wind chill on record in the United States is believed to be the minus 108 degrees on the summit of New Hampshire's Mount Washington on Feb. 3, 2023.\n\nThat was the lowest wind chill ever recorded in the United States since meteorologists began calculating wind chills, according to Brian Brettschneider, an Alaska-based climate scientist.

On the other hand, Russia “makes most of its own weapons” and is “buying drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea ” with no limitations on how they are used. It also enjoys an advantage in raw manpower, bolstered by massive conscription drives.\n\nVladimir Putin aims to have a bigger army than America’s, with 1.5 million active servicemen, “a sign of Russia’s relentless militarisation”, said Sky News ’ Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett.\n\nIts superiority in personnel and materials – along with the use of new “infiltration tactics”, reported by Deutsche Welle – has seen it make steady but slow progress on the battlefield.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAfter “seizing the initiative” in 2024, last year Russian forces advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 metres per day, “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century”, said the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) think tank.\n\nIn truth, Russia is “having more success obliterating Ukraine’s electricity grid and municipal heating plants, leaving civilians shivering in sub-zero cold, than it is securing any decisive victory on the battlefield”, said Radio Free Europe.\n\nThe suggestion by Putin and senior Russian government and military figures that Ukraine’s front line faces “imminent collapse” is a “false narrative”, said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. Such claims are likely to be “an effort to coerce the West and Ukraine into capitulating to Russian demands that Russia cannot secure itself militarily”.\n\nWhat does victory look like for each side?\n\nBefore Russia launched its invasion, Putin outlined the objectives of what he called a “special military operation”. His goal, he claimed, was to “denazify” and “demilitarise” Ukraine, and to defend Donetsk and Luhansk, the two eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.\n\nAnother objective, although never explicitly stated, was to topple the Ukrainian government and remove President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,” said Zelenskyy shortly after the invasion. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound.\n\nRussia shifted its objectives, however, about a month into the invasion, after Russian forces were forced to retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. According to the Kremlin, its main goal became the “liberation of the Donbas”, including the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe Trump administration’s initial 28-point plan published at the end of last year suggested Russia’s “minimum requirement” remains “occupying the entirety of the Donbas region (comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk)”, said The Economist . Most contentiously, this includes territory it has so far failed to take by force. Other provisions include limits on the size of Ukraine’s army and missile capability, and barring it from Nato membership or hosting Nato peacekeepers on its soil.\n\nKyiv was quick to denounce these demands as amounting to capitulation and countered with its own 20-point framework. This proposed security guarantees from the US, Nato and European countries to prevent further Russian aggression, with the potential option of establishing a demilitarised “free economic zone” in eastern Donbas.\n\nWhile this represents a softening of Ukraine’s position, it is still unlikely to be palatable to Putin. The Russian president would gladly have taken as a win a “Kremlin-friendly peace plan that enshrines Ukraine’s perpetual subordination”, said The New York Times . But he’ll also see “a failed process” as a victory if it leads Donald Trump to “pull remaining support for Ukraine”. With his economy struggling and his troops mired in a slow advance that’s had a steep cost in “lives and matériel”, Putin’s capacity for continued war “isn’t limitless”. But he believes “time is on his side” and his goal hasn’t shifted: he “wants to break Ukraine”.\n\nHow many Russian and Ukrainian troops have died in the conflict?\n\nTrue casualty figures are “notoriously difficult to pin down”, said Newsweek , and “experts caution that both sides likely inflate the other’s reported losses”.\n\nAs of January this year, Russian forces had suffered “nearly 1.2 million casualties”, which would mark “more losses than any major power in any war since World War II”, said CSIS. “At current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties could reach 2 million by the spring of 2026.”\n\nUkrainian casualty tolls – including deaths, injuries, and soldiers classified as missing – are around 500,000 to 600,000, compared to Russia’s 1.2 million, said Brad Lendon of CNN .\n\nThis is a dramatic increase, even within the last year. In June, Russia’s wartime toll reached a “historic milestone”, said The Guardian , with more than a million troops killed or injured since the start of the invasion, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Russia Matters cited MoD estimates for October 2025 that put the number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded at 1,118,000.\n\nRussian authorities do not release official casualty figures but the “huge battlefield losses” are clear for all to see, said Rosenberg. “So many of the towns and villages I’ve visited in the last two years have had museums and monuments dedicated to soldiers killed in Ukraine, as well as separate sections for recent war dead at local cemeteries.”", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2025/05/20/trump-putin-ukraine-russia-war-ambassador-resign/83730305007/", "title": "Trump's Ukraine policy left me no choice but to resign | Opinion", "text": "Bridget Brink\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMay 20, 2025, 6:03 a.m. ET\n\nI just came home to Michigan from three years in the toughest job of my life – serving as the American Ambassador to Ukraine – supporting our democratic ally against brutal, unprovoked aggression by Russia.\n\nI have proudly served five presidents – Republicans and Democrats – to make sure the United States is the strongest, greatest country that the world has ever known.\n\nI respect the president’s right and responsibility to determine U.S. foreign policy – with proper checks and balances by U.S. Congress. It is the role of America’s Foreign Service to execute that policy. Unfortunately, the policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia.\n\nAs such, I could no longer in good faith carry out the administration’s policy and felt it was my duty to step down. After nearly three decades serving our country, I resigned as our ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nI cannot stand by while a country is invaded, a democracy bombarded and children killed with impunity. I believe that the only way to secure U.S. interests is to stand up for democracies and to stand against autocrats. Peace at any price is not peace at all – it is appeasement. And history has taught us time and again that appeasement does not lead to safety, security or prosperity. It leads to more war and suffering.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n'Pure evil'\n\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, it has done what can only be described as pure evil: killed thousands of civilians, including 700 children, with missiles and drones that hit their homes and apartments in the dead of night.\n\nIt has committed over 150,000 war crimes, abducted 20,000 children from their families, and forced millions of men, women and children to flee into Europe and elsewhere.\n\nFor three years I heard the stories, saw the brutality, and felt the pain of families whose sons and daughters were killed and wounded by Russian missiles and drones that hit playgrounds, churches and schools. Over a career spent in conflict zones, I’ve seen mass atrocities and wanton destruction first-hand but we have never seen violence so systematic, so widespread and so horrifying in Europe since World War II.\n\nWhat we do matters\n\nWhy does Russia’s invasion of Ukraine matter to the United States?\n\nIt matters because how we handle this war will speak volumes to our friends as well as our foes. If we allow Putin to redraw borders by force, he won’t stop with Ukraine. Taken at his word, Putin’s ambition is to resurrect an imperial past – and he can’t do that without threatening the security of our NATO allies.\n\nAnd if Putin succeeds, it sends signals to China that will undermine the security balance in Asia and throughout the world. That will have profound implications for America’s safety, security and prosperity.\n\nEurope is our largest trading partner, with a $1.6 trillion dollar relationship that fuels 16 million jobs on both continents, including right here in Michigan. Maintaining 80 years of peace that came out of the devastation of World War II – and the economic growth, trade and real jobs that flow from it – is what is at stake for us in Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nBut Russia’s war is about more than foreign policy or economics. It’s about who we are.\n\nThe US must lead the free world\n\nMy grandfather, who grew up in Charlotte, Michigan, proudly served our nation as a soldier in World War II while my grandmother supported their only child by renting out rooms in their home in Lansing. My grandparents did not see each other for three year and my mom didn’t know her own dad when he came home, but they understood doing what was right.\n\nThe America I love, the one our grandparents served, would never stand by and let such horrors happen.\n\nOr give up helping our friends. Or appease the aggressor.\n\nWe must hold fast to who we are: a just, generous and hardworking people, blessed with a democratic and accountable government, the largest free market economy in the world and the most powerful military in human history. We must show leadership in the face of aggression, not weakness or complicity. When America does not lead the free world, what is at risk is our own success as a nation.\n\nThis is the America I love, and was proud to serve every day.\n\nI may no longer be an American diplomat, but I will never stop believing in the need for American leadership to secure our own future and offer the beacon of hope and possibility for every Michigander, every American and so many others around the world.\n\nBridget Brink, a native of Grand Rapids, resigned as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in April after nearly three decades in the U.S. Foreign Service.

The guard begins moving back towards the gate, and soon another guard comes into frame.\n\nAbout 25 seconds later, people who had just walked across to Crimea, are seen – suitcases in tow – running back across the border. The lights suddenly go out at the station, and the camera switches to black and white, recording in infrared.\n\n4:08 a.m.: An individual dressed in camouflage is seen carrying a flashlight coming around one of the border guard stations. Three minutes later, three more individuals in camouflage are seen walking around the border crossing. Minutes later, the the camera cuts out.\n\nVery soon after, another webcam at the Chongar border crossing – the only other active border crossing station from Crimea – shows lights suddenly turning off, and, minutes later, the camera turns off as well.\n\nPutin announces ‘operation’\n\n4:50 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin made a speech, saying he had decided “to conduct a special military operation … to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years,” repeating a baseless claim about Ukraine’s Russian-separatist-backed Donbas region.\n\nHe denied, however, that Russia was planning to occupy Ukrainian territories. “We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's speech was broadcast minutes before the bombardment began.

People in the cities of Odessa, Dnipro, Mariupol and Kramatorsk reported huge blasts.\n\nSeveral detonations to the east of Kyiv let off massive plumes of gray smoke rising into the night sky. One of the chief targets was the main international airport at Boryspil, which is pummeled by missiles.\n\nVideo showed a cruise missile hitting a military installation at the airport at Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Airports were also hit in Kharkiv, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk and Chornobaivka.\n\nMost of the targets were military bases, but there was clearly substantial damage in and around several cities. In Kharkiv, video emerged of an apartment block that had been damaged by a missile or long-range artillery. Another video showed a rocket embedded in a road.

Even before he plunged Nato into the biggest crisis in its 80-year history by threatening to take Greenland by force, Donald Trump had used the threat of US withdrawal from the alliance as a tool to pressure other members to boost defence allocations.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAmerica is by far Nato’s biggest player and spends almost as much on defence as the next 10 spenders in the world combined. Its total in 2024 was about $997 billion (£728 billion), according to Statista – nearly 40% of the total military spending worldwide that year. The UK sits in sixth place, with spending of $81.8 billion (£59.7 billion).\n\nAmid fears the US could even pull out of the alliance, Nato members in June agreed to an ambitious 2035 target of spending 5% GDP on defence. While the US commitment “should remain iron-clad,” said a Washington Post editorial at the time, it was only right Europe should take up more of the burden so that Washington can “make major investments” to confront the rise of China. This is still worth it to Europe: Nato is “worth fighting, and spending, to preserve”.\n\nRecent violations of Polish, Romanian and Estonian airspace by Russian jets and drones has “thrust Nato’s collective defence principles into the spotlight”, said Al Jazeera.\n\nBeing members of Nato, a drone attack on any of those countries “could trigger Article 5 of the Nato treaty”, meaning that all other Nato members, including the US, would be compelled, under the mutual assistance clause, to come to their aid. And, together, their substantial firepower could give Nato the edge in all-out war.\n\nNato’s resources have also been bolstered by the accession of two new member states since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine: Finland, which joined in April 2023, and Sweden, which was admitted in March 2024 after a two-year struggle to overcome vetos from Hungary and Turkey.\n\nWhile both have large defence industries and advance military capabilities, the biggest contribution the two new members bring to the table is “geostrategic”, said the US Institute of Peace think-tank, their location shoring up the alliance’s exposed northeastern flank and shielding the Baltic states, regarded as most vulnerable to future Russian aggression.\n\nBut as well as how much governments spend, how they spend that money is also important. “Duplicate and incompatible capabilities” are a problem: there are 178 weapon systems types and 17 different makes of tank in the EU alone, said the BBC . Defence contracts tend to be negotiated years in advance and production takes a long time so untangling inefficiencies and pooling resources would not be quick or easy.\n\nCollectively, the 32 members of Nato can field a “powerful, and modern fighting force,” said Kyiv Independent, “but – its European contingent at least – faces ammunition shortages, a fragmented defence industry, and insufficient air defence coverage”.\n\nWestern armies, with their artillery and armoured vehicles, are out of date whereas “it is Ukraine that today has perhaps the most combat-ready army in Europe”, wrote Oleg Dunda, a member of parliament for Ukraine, in The Spectator . The US has more weaponry but Ukraine’s army is unique in having adapted to the new, mostly electronic, unmanned systems that are the most successful elements of the Russian barrage. A potential invasion of the Baltic states might not involve a single tank.\n\n“It will be unexpected: with communication blackouts, drone strikes on infrastructure and civilian convoys in uniform without identification marks,” said Dunda. “Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania may simply wake up as part of Russia. Without a single shot fired by Nato.” An invasion of the Baltics could happen at any time, including while Russia is still fighting in Ukraine. Europe does not necessarily have much time to prepare but it is not necessary to spend 5% of GDP, as Nato chief Mark Rutte is pushing for, because drones cost a lot less than nuclear submarines and are more effective for the war ahead.\n\nWhat’s key to Nato – and a big question mark when it comes to the US under Trump – is Article 5 of its charter. This mutual assistance clause is central to the idea of collective defence. It requires that in the event one member is attacked all other members would be compelled to come to its aid. Together, their substantial firepower could give Nato the edge in all-out war.\n\nRussia’s military power\n\nDespite international sanctions and its well-publicised struggles in Ukraine, Russia has “accelerated its military production”, said UK Defence Journal . Military spending has surged to an estimated €120 billion (£103 billion) in 2025 – equivalent to over 6% of GDP – nearly quadrupling the country’s 2021 defence budget.\n\nThe German intelligence service and army “believe the Russian war economy is generating more output than is required solely for operations in Ukraine”, suggesting it could be preparing for a wider confrontation.\n\nLast year, Putin launched Russia’s biggest conscription drive in over a decade, as he looks to boost the number of active servicemen to 1.5 million. While this would give Russia a bigger army than the US alone, it still falls well behind Nato’s collective might. According to Statista , Nato has 3,439,197 active soldiers, compared to Russia’s current 1,320,000. Russia has only about 4,292 military aircraft compared with Nato’s combined 22,377, and 419 military ships compared to Nato’s 1,143. Russia is decisively outnumbered by Nato for tanks (5,750 to 11,495), and in terms of armoured vehicles overall its stock of 131,527 is dwarfed by Nato’s 971,280.\n\n\n\nThe two forces are evenly matched in terms of known nuclear capability, with the Nato nuclear powers – the US, UK and France – able to field 5,559 nuclear warheads to Russia’s 5,580. In October, Putin announced the successful test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile – nicknamed the “Flying Chernobyl” because it emits radioactive exhaust from its unshielded reactor. It is capable of flying for 15 hours non-stop and covering a distance of 14,000 km (8,700 miles), putting almost all Nato states in its range.\n\nRussia’s war economy has so far remained remarkably resilient in the face of Western sanctions. This has allowed its “military-industrial complex to churn out tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, missiles, ammunition and artillery pieces”, said Al Jazeera .\n\nWhile it continues to make slow but steady gains on the battlefield, Russia is also “ramping up its war machine at breakneck speed”, said United 24.\n\nThe Kremlin’s ambitious production targets reveal preparations not only for its war against Ukraine but also for a potential large-scale confrontation with Nato as early as 2029 “if its armament efforts persist”, said Reuters.\n\nThese ambitious production targets reveal preparations not only for its war against Ukraine but also for a potential confrontation with Nato by 2030.\n\nA full-scale attack on a Nato member is not as far-fetched as it might seem, according to Germany’s chief of defence, General Carsten Breuer. Russia has been producing “hundreds of tanks a year”, he told the BBC – enough to attack a Nato Baltic state by the end of the decade.\n\nAnd the ammunition supplies that Russia is also producing, such as drones, missiles and artillery shells, aren’t all going to the war in Ukraine; “there’s a build-up of the stocks”, too, the general said. He identified the Suwałki Gap, an area on the Russian border with Poland, Lithuania and Belarus as the most “vulnerable” area for an invasion that “could trigger a larger war between Russia and the US”.\n\nThe cost of war\n\nThe cost of destruction in the warzone, higher energy prices, and a sell-off in financial markets could total $1.5 trillion (£1.14 trillion) in the first year, roughly the same as the impact of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to Bloomberg Economics.\n\nThe human cost aside, Baltic states would naturally be the worst affected, suffering a 43% hit to their economies in the first year of fighting. Frontline Nato members such as Poland and Finland would take a “smaller but still significant hit as missiles fly” while GDP of the EU as a whole would fall by 1.2% “and debt would be put on a steeper upward trajectory”. Losses would be “much greater if the conflict spilled into other European countries”.\n\nWho would win then?\n\nDespite small signs of improvement, and the latest fighting talk from Putin, “Russia is in no shape to take on Nato”, with the alliance having been “revitalised” by the invasion of Ukraine, said Al Jazeera.\n\nEven without the US, the collective military capability of Nato members is “formidable”, said George Allison in The Telegraph.\n\n“The technological sophistication and interoperability of Nato forces significantly amplify their combat effectiveness.” The alliance’s “strength resides in its ability to leverage cutting-edge technology and integrated command structures to conduct operations adaptable to the battlefield’s rapidly changing circumstances”.\n\nWith an integrated command structure developed over decades, better trained and equipped troops and the “notable difference in the quality of Western weapons, all this adds up to the conclusion that Nato would quickly prevail in any conventional war against Russia”, said Al Jazeera.\n\nYet herein lies the “danger”: that “a series of defeats might force Moscow to use tactical nuclear weapons or face total defeat”.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/russia-ukraine-war-one-month-what-matters", "title": "What the second month of war in Ukraine may bring | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nWashington CNN —\n\nRussia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has entered its second month with scores of civilians dead, entire communities leveled, and perhaps most troubling, no end in sight.\n\nThe invasion has produced a mix of expected (economic pain in Russia) and unexpected developments (remarkable Ukrainian military resistance), leaving little room for confidence about what will happen next.\n\nBut what have we learned so far? CNN posed a few key questions to Henry Hale, a George Washington University professor whose expertise includes Russian politics. Our conversation, lightly edited for flow and brevity, is below.\n\nWhat’s been surprising about the war?\n\nAcross Ukraine, Russian soldiers have met stiff resistance from Ukrainian fighters capably defending their country against all odds. In fact, Ukrainian forces have been trying recently to regain territory from the Russians, according to a senior US defense official, who described them as “able and willing” to do so.\n\nBut Ukraine’s military strength has not been the only surprise.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What has been most surprising to you one month into the invasion?\n\nHALE: In the big picture, I think the invasion itself is just quite surprising in the stunning scale of the event in world history. While Russian President Vladimir Putin has certainly acted militarily before, very few people thought before, maybe a year ago, that Putin was actually contemplating a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPeople within Russia didn’t expect it, most Ukrainians didn’t expect it. And most analysts, I think, also didn’t expect it. And what was interesting was that the Biden administration started warning that this was going to take place, and it turned out that they were right.\n\nThere are a number of other surprises that I think are also important. One, I think, is just the poor nature of Russia’s planning for this.\n\nFirst of all, its military strategy appears to have been very ill-suited for the task at hand. It seems to have been based on the idea that Ukraine was going to capitulate within a matter of days, that it would be greeted with people coming out into the streets with flowers. And that just was based on a complete misunderstanding of Ukraine and the nature of Ukrainian society.\n\nAnother part of the poor planning that I think is also very important is that the Kremlin did not prime Russia’s own public well for this kind of action. Right up until the actual invasion was launched, Russian media were telling their own people: “We’re not going to invade.” Russian leaders were saying: “Look at how hysterical the West is talking about an invasion. That’s just crazy. No one’s talking about an invasion.”\n\nAnd so what that meant was that once the actual invasion started, they had to convince people that it was not an invasion. And that means elaborating a whole propaganda edifice around the idea that this is just a limited military operation, that somehow there are Nazis in Kyiv that are attacking freedom-loving people in the Russian-occupied territories of eastern Ukraine – that this is all part of a grand Western scheme to eventually take down Russia, bring it under its control. And so supporting such a lie is very, very difficult.\n\nAnother surprise has been the capabilities of the Ukrainian military. Most people’s memory of Ukraine’s military came from 2014 (when Russia invaded and subsequently annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine).\n\nIt turns out that, behind the headlines, significant military reform efforts have been taking place, including a restructuring of the decision-making process within the military there, which included giving local commanders more autonomy to make calls. And this turns out to have been quite important because the Ukrainian military has managed to hold its own against the much larger Russian military for this first month of the crisis.\n\nWhat’s played out as expected?\n\nOther elements of the invasion, like Russian troop morale and Putin’s crackdown on dissent within Russia, are playing out as expected under the circumstances.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What hasn’t surprised you?\n\nHALE: I think one thing that that was to be expected is the poor Russian troop morale. In part, this relates to what I said about one of the surprises, which was people in Russia were not prepared for the idea of an invasion.\n\nBut I think part of the reason that they didn’t initially want to prepare them to actually support an invasion of Ukraine is that it would be very hard to convince people that something like this would be actually necessary. And it turns out basically they sent these soldiers into combat having told them: “Well, you’re just going to be participating in exercises.” But then they find themselves sent into Ukraine, shooting on people who they are told are Nazis but don’t really look much like Nazis.\n\nAnd in this context, I think one would expect that the actual Russian troops themselves might not be that highly motivated. And I think that’s something that we see.\n\nAnother thing that has played out as expected if Russia were to launch something like this is that the invasion is accompanied by a harsh crackdown within Russia itself on any kind of dissent and the spread of any kind of accurate information.\n\nSo they’ve basically tried to cut off any sources of external information. They’ve made it illegal to even call this a “war” or an “invasion.” You have to use the officially, approved terminology of a “military operation,” or “a targeted operation” to “denazify” Ukraine.\n\nWestern leaders present united front\n\nLeaders attending a slew of emergency summits this week were working to settle on the next phase of their response to Russia’s war, with new US sanctions and refugee assistance among the steps emerging from the snap talks.\n\nIn a statement afterward, President Joe Biden said NATO was “as strong and united as it has ever been.”\n\nWHAT MATTERS: How significant are the emergency summits among Western leaders?\n\nHALE: I think that the different meetings are oriented toward possible developments that are going to happen in this war. And it’s very hard right now to anticipate exactly what they are, but I think people want to get on the same page.\n\nI think it’s unlikely that Russia is going to be able to enjoy any kind of full victory. And so that raises lots of questions about what will need to be done in the future.\n\nI’m personally skeptical that we’re going to see a negotiated end to this anytime soon. I think the Ukrainians are just too determined to fight. And if Putin is kind of failing sufficiently to be forced into a position of negotiation, I think Ukrainians are just going to be less and less willing to give him a break basically by recognizing any of the territorial gains that his military has made up to this point.\n\nBut at the same time, it’s prudent to keep diplomatic channels open.\n\nWhere do things go from here?\n\nWhile there’s a growing picture that Russia’s assault on Ukraine has not gone to plan, the country continues to use its air power to obliterate cities and target civilians to push Ukraine into submission.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Some experts warn that we could be entering a deadlier phase of this war, with Putin feeling the need to double down on his attacks in the face of embarrassment. Do you share this concern?\n\nHALE: Unfortunately, I think that is a very real concern. I think almost everything is at stake for Putin right now, because anything short of victory is going to be seen as a sign of weakness for him at a time when he’s already pushing 70 and questions are already arising within Russia even before these events about succession.\n\nIt’s not out of the question, sad to say, that he might decide that his only bet is to employ some kind of nuclear option. It’s hard to say exactly what that would be, but it’s possible. I don’t think that the Russian population is supportive, in general, of starting a nuclear war – certainly not deploying a nuclear weapon against people whom Putin and his regime have been constantly telling people are basically one people with Russians.\n\nAnd so I think it’s possible that the use of a nuclear weapon could actually lead to the collapse of his regime among people who are appalled by that.\n\nOne would also hope that if he did order an action like that, that maybe some people within his command that would have to actually carry out that order would, at that point, refuse to carry out his orders. So it’s very hard to say.\n\nI mean, if he really has gone so far in and is just willing to do anything in the hopes of saving himself and his regime, then I don’t think we can rule out some form of nuclear escalation here.\n\nBut I still harbor hope that, in fact, he’s not suicidal and would try to find some way short of that to be able to claim some kind of victory within Russia itself.\n\nChina’s role\n\nThe US has information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance as part of its war on Ukraine.\n\nThat leaves open a troubling possibility for American officials – that China may help prolong a bloody conflict that is increasingly killing civilians, while also cementing an authoritarian alliance in direct competition with the United States.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What would it mean for China to provide Russia with military and financial assistance?\n\nHALE: My sense is that the most important impact would be symbolic, giving Russia and people within the Russian regime a sense that this is not just Putin – that Russia and Putin have allies in this endeavor. And that might sustain their willingness to continue to prosecute this military operation that they’re engaged in and to kind of carry the invasion as far as they can.\n\nAnd obviously if Russian supplies are weakened and Russia’s economy is already weakened, this will help reduce the costs that are felt by ordinary Russians resulting from these actions. So I think that’s kind of what’s at stake.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m not sure that it’s really in Chinese interests to really all out take the side of Russia. To some extent, I think it’s in China’s interest just to sit back and let the Russians and the Europeans and the Americans kind of go at it.\n\nThe big picture\n\nDepending on your view, the West and Russia are now fighting the last struggle of the Cold War or the first in a new age of confrontation as autocracies like Moscow and Beijing form a broad hostile front against Western-style democracy.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Thinking long term, what kind of damage has Russia done to its reputation on the world stage, and what are the best and worst outcomes for Russia at this point?\n\nHALE: Unfortunately these criminal actions, I think, have soiled Russia’s reputation probably for a generation in the world and in other countries of the post-Soviet space.\n\nAnd of course exactly what that means will be affected by how the war ends. On one hand, if it winds up being that the Russian population somehow winds up toppling Putin, or people around Putin wind up toppling Putin and ending the war and pulling out the Russian troops, that would be the best outcome for Russia itself, because then at least it would give a lot of people within Russia credibility in saying, “Well, this was not us.”\n\nOn the other hand, if Russia continues to prosecute the war, if the regime stays stable, if most people within Russia are quiet or just leave – in which case then you have a highly autocratic system in Russia, much more autocratic than had been the case before.\n\nI think this reputation is just going to be so toxic that you’re going to see a divide that very much resembles the divide between the communists and the free world during the Cold War, where there’s not going to be a lot of interaction across those borders. And that could last as long as the Kremlin is able to survive in power.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/europe/ukraine-war-trans-challenges-intl-cmd", "title": "'I wanted to resume my transition at all costs.' Trans Ukrainians ...", "text": "Chisinau, Moldova and London CNN —\n\nThe best day of Eric’s life came just days before the worst.\n\nAfter years of waiting, dozens of tests and a two-week stay on a psychiatric ward, Eric was finally getting his first testosterone shot. Eric is a 23-year-old transgender man from Ukraine. Assigned female at birth, he says starting hormone therapy was a major step in his quest to become his true self.\n\n“It was utter happiness. I was euphoric, it was the moment that I’ve been waiting for for so long,” Eric, who asked for his last name to not be used because he is concerned for his safety, told CNN in Chisinau, Moldova, in July.\n\nBut just days after Eric had what should have been the first in a series of testosterone injections administered at a clinic in Kyiv, Russia invaded Ukraine. Everything changed.\n\n“The clinic had closed because of the danger of airstrikes. I had the testosterone, but no way of getting [it administered]. I didn’t have the needles and there were huge shortages of everything in pharmacies, even the most basic stuff, because obviously, during the war, there’s a big need for things like syringes,” Eric said.\n\nRussia’s brutal assault on Ukraine has upended the lives of millions of Ukrainians. But for Eric and many other trans people, the war has also made it much more difficult to be who they are.\n\nEric fled Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in late February, but has since returned. Ivana Kottasová/CNN\n\nMany lost access to vital medication and psychological help. Some were completely cut off from their communities and forced into spaces where LGBTQ people were not welcome, according to the Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe.\n\nBureaucratic problems, such as having personal documents issued under a different gender, can put them at extra risk.\n\nThe Ukrainian transgender rights group Cohort says it has helped more than 1,500 people since the start of the war, assisting them to move to safer areas and helping them pay their bills. The NGO also works with shelters to make sure they have the basic supplies they need.\n\nBut the number one request Cohort has been receiving in recent months is for help getting hormone therapy, or HRT, according to Anastasiia Yeva Domani, Cohort’s co-founder and executive director.\n\nHRT can be used by trans women, trans men and non-binary people to make their physical appearance more aligned with their gender identity. The drugs alter the body’s testosterone or estrogen hormone levels and trigger physical changes that normally occur during puberty.\n\nAs with other medicines, Ukraine’s supplies of hormone drugs have been severely limited since the beginning of the war. Supply chains are often interrupted by fighting and buying from abroad is increasingly difficult because the collapse in the value of the Ukrainian currency has made imports a lot more expensive, Domani said.\n\n“Some people started substituting for cheaper versions of the products, or they lower their dose to try to stretch [their supply] out. Very often, they don’t speak to their endocrinologist about this, which is dangerous,” she added.\n\nHormone therapies are typically prescribed in gradually increasing doses with careful monitoring until a stable hormone level is reached, according to Gendered Intelligence, a UK-based charity and grassroots organization supporting trans people. Different people may require different doses, because everyone responds differently to the therapy.\n\n“Having a safe and stable hormone level is important because hormones govern a wide range of bodily functions, from brain activity to bone development,” Cleo Madeleine, the spokesperson for Gendered Intelligence, told CNN.\n\nAnastasiia Yeva Domani is the co-founder of Cohort, a Ukrainian trans rights group. Kateryna Kryuchkova\n\n“If a trans person is forced to lower their dose below the prescribed amount because of medicine shortages or disruption to supply lines – as we have seen in Ukraine – it could cause mood instability, aggravate gender dysphoria, and even lead to more serious health issues.”\n\nThe situation in Ukraine has become so desperate, Domani said, that some people, rather than face the potential effects of withdrawal, have turned to self-medicating with homemade substitutes.\n\n“There are people who have been making their own HRT at home and they sell it through Telegram channels and things like that,” she said. “They are definitely not safe.”\n\nBuying cheaper drugs online can also be extremely risky.\n\n“We strongly discourage self-medication with irregularly sourced drug treatments. Internet sourced hormone therapies can be dangerous and are sometimes contaminated,” the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) warns.\n\nEric fled Ukraine shortly after the beginning of the war. “I thought I was going to die there. The alarms, the explosions all the time, the sirens were going off 20 times a day, I was afraid for my life,” he said.\n\nWith his passport still under the name he was given at birth, Eric was allowed to cross the border into Moldova, where he was safe from Russian bombs. Ukraine’s government barred most men of fighting age from leaving the country soon after the war broke out.\n\nAt first, Eric was able to find a doctor who administered the shots he brought with him from Ukraine. But once he ran out of those, he was left without medication.\n\nSome of the effects of the earlier treatment started to reverse – for example, his menstrual cycle came back after stopping earlier in the process and he experienced mood swings, he said. Worn out by stress and uncertainty, and traumatized by the war, he became emotionally numb, he said.\n\n‘An active movement’\n\nWhile still lagging behind many western European countries, Ukraine has taken steps in recent years to become more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, for example by adopting broad anti-discriminatory laws. This is partly because of Kyiv’s desire to join the European Union, which requires future member states to adopt laws protecting minorities.\n\nBut several people have also told CNN that Russia’s assault on Ukraine has prompted an even greater push for equality and inclusion, because Ukrainians realized their values were also under attack.\n\nThe Russian government has become increasingly homophobic under President Vladimir Putin. In 2013, it passed a law banning “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors, which the European Court of Human Rights ruled to be discriminatory and in violation of human rights.\n\nIn November, the Russian parliament expanded the law to ban all Russians from promoting or “praising” homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are “normal.” According to Human Rights Watch, the new law would also “isolate children from any information on alternative sexual orientation and gender identity, including gender transition.”\n\nPutin has made no secret of the fact that his assault on Ukraine was partly motivated by Kyiv’s desire to align itself more closely with the Western world and its values. Alluding to Western acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, he accused the West of “imposing attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature.” The top priest of the Russian Orthodox Church and Putin’s close ally Patriarch Kirill went as far as suggesting gay pride parades were part of the reason for the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile trans Ukrainians still experience negative attitudes in some spaces, for example in shelters housing families, according to COHORT, the discriminatory Russian rhetoric has pushed more Ukrainians to speak up.\n\nArtur Ozerov said the war has caused a shift in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people in Ukraine. Courtesy Artur Ozerov\n\n“Never before would we get 25,000 signatures on a petition to support same sex marriage and have the president saying he is working on legalizing civil partnerships, including same sex partnerships,” Domani said. “The Istanbul Convention was ratified in July, which is something the LGBTQ+ community has been really hoping for for a long time,” she said referring to the international treaty to protect women against violence.\n\nCivil servant Arthur Ozerov told CNN he experienced this shift in attitudes first hand when he decided to come out as an LGBTQ+ person and an occasional drag queen earlier this year.\n\n“I was pleasantly surprised. I didn’t have any problems at all. My colleagues at work, even those who used to be homophobic, treated me well,” he said.\n\n“The attitude of Ukrainians towards LGBTQ+ people has changed dramatically since the beginning of the war, there is an active movement now regarding their rights and freedoms,” he added.\n\nOzerov said he believed this was partly because like himself, many people have come out as LGBTQ+ while being directly involved in the war effort, from fighting on the front lines to volunteering – encompassing anything from helping distribute supplies to making petrol bombs and rebuilding – and helping the people worst impacted by the war. Ozerov himself wears a uniform when working with the military in his capacity as a civil servant.\n\nBut there is another reason for the more liberal attitudes, he said.\n\nBeing under attack from Russia, which ostracizes the LGBTQ+ community with its laws, has made many Ukrainians realize they want to support European values that promote inclusion and equality, he said.\n\nFleeing the war\n\nMore than 7.8 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in late February, according to the United Nations. Of those, more than 4.7 million have registered for temporary protection in countries across Europe.\n\nFor most, the decision on whether and where to go was informed by friends and family, their financial situation and the ability to travel. But for people from LGBTQ+ communities, there’s a whole other set of concerns.\n\nThe rights of trans people are weaker in some European Union countries than they are in Ukraine. For example, the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia, Hungary and Romania still require trans people to undergo sterilization if they want to change their gender – despite a 2017 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which found such laws violate Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. A bill seeking to overturn the requirement is currently making its way through the parliament in Finland.\n\nPoland and Hungary, two countries that border Ukraine and have seen a large influx of refugees, have both seen a pushback against LGBTQ rights in recent years – so much so that the European Commission launched legal action against them over the issue in July 2021.\n\nAnd in some European countries, getting access to HRT can be a more complicated and lengthy process than in Ukraine, because local laws might require longer assessments before treatment starts, according to data compiled by Transgender Europe, a network of more than 200 trans rights groups.\n\nThat was part of the reason why, when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Edward Reese was initially determined to stay put.\n\n“I didn’t want to leave because I had my top surgery planned in Kyiv in March,” Reese, who identifies as trans masculine and works for KyivPride, told CNN, referring to the procedure to change the appearance of his chest, in this case through removal of breast tissue.\n\nReese has been very open about the transition process, documenting it on his blog and TikTok. He was doing it to raise funds for the surgery, but also to raise awareness of the problems trans people face in Ukraine.\n\n“I wanted to show other trans masculine folks how to do it in Ukraine, so I documented all the steps that I went through in my blog,” Reese said.\n\nBut shortly after the invasion, Reese’s doctor left the country. The surgery was off.\n\nEdward Reese, right, attends Stockholm Pride in August 2022. Olha Androsova\n\nAlthough Reese didn’t want to leave Ukraine, he was forced to start looking into other options in order to still have his operation in March. He left for Copenhagen, Denmark that month.\n\nTrans people have gained more rights in Denmark in recent years; the country allows legal gender change based on self-identification and in 2016 removed identifying as transgender from its official list of mental disorders. But waiting times for gender-affirming health care can be very long, Reese said.\n\n“In Ukraine, before the war, you could buy the medication really easily. You have to go through psychiatric evaluation, but it only takes two weeks up to a month,” Reese said. “It’s much harder in all European countries that I am aware of.”\n\nAccording to a report by Transgender Europe, waiting times for an initial appointment with a specialist can stretch to years in several European Union countries, including Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nReese said he contemplated trying to get hormones via unofficial channels, including online, but decided that this was too dangerous.\n\n“I decided to [stop the medicine] because I have been just starting. So it’s not a big return for me. When a person is a year or two on hormones, it’s definitely much harder,” Reese said. He had been taking hormones for three months.\n\nWhile willing to pause the hormonal therapy, Reese was not prepared to compromise on the operation.\n\n“When I came here, I talked to trans people and they told me about this crazy long process of transitioning and said that Danish trans masculine people go for their surgeries to Malmö in Sweden. There is a private clinic, where you don’t have to wait. You just pay money, and you do what you want to do, and they don’t ask you a million questions,” Reese said. He had the surgery there, recovered and has returned to Ukraine in October.\n\nDrawing on his own experience, Reese has started an online support group for trans and non-binary Ukrainians who have found themselves cut off from their communities. “Many trans people who are underage or students, they have to stay with their parents. For example, the family is gathering together to go to another country or to another city or something like this, they might be students who had to return from their dormitories to home and their parents are transphobic. I want to provide a nice cozy atmosphere for them,” Reese said.\n\n‘It’s all that matters’\n\nGetting connected to advocacy groups or online communities can become vital for trans people fleeing conflict.\n\nAnastasiia Danilova, the executive director of GENDERDOC-M, the only LGBT rights advocacy organization in Moldova, said that when the situation in Ukraine started to deteriorate in late February, her group started to think about the help trans refugees might need.\n\n“People are fleeing a war, that’s already huge stress, it’s already tough and then there is additional trauma, additional pressure, aggression or stress due to their identities – of not being accepted in common shelters, for example,” she said.\n\nMore than 697,000 people have been recorded as crossing into Moldova from Ukraine since the beginning of the war. According to the UN, about 96,000 are registered as refugees there. GENDERDOC-M wanted to make sure everyone felt welcome. The group launched a hotline for LGBTQ+ Ukrainians and opened an LGBTQ+ friendly shelter.\n\n“When people came, we provided them with accommodation, meals, medical, psychological, legal support and are working with our partner organizations in Ukraine,” Danilova said, adding that, as of November, the group had helped about 200 LGBTQ people from Ukraine.\n\nIt was GENDERDOC-M that eventually helped Eric secure the drugs he needed to resume his transition. It also provided a place for him to find new friends and be himself.\n\n“I wanted to resume my transition at all costs. lt’s my life, it’s all that matters,” he said. “It was life-saving for me.”\n\nSince his return to Ukraine in early October, Eric has kept busy volunteering at a humanitarian hub run by an LGBTQ organization and at a soup kitchen that provides free meals for the elderly. He has also continued with his transition.\n\n“I could always use some more hair in the beard department, but otherwise it’s going pretty good,” he told CNN.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/02/22/russia-invades-ukraine-voices-ukrainians/6711234001/", "title": "Russia invades Ukraine: These are the voices from the war", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nFeb. 22, 2022 Updated April 1, 2022, 4:09 p.m. ET\n\nIt has been more than a month since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, forcing millions of people to flee their homes and leaving cities like Mariupol in ruins.\n\nThousands have been killed, with thousands more injured.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces keep Russian troops at bay outside Kyiv and negotiations start and sputter, what happens next could define the region and global foreign policy for generations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/opinions/volodomyr-zelensky-profile-ukraine-russia-bociurkiw", "title": "Opinion: Where Zelensky goes from here | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Michael Bociurkiw (@WorldAffairsPro) is a global affairs analyst currently based in Odesa.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nOdesa CNN —\n\nLess than a year into his term as president of Ukraine, Volodomyr Zelensky’s skills as negotiator were put to the test in his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMichael Bociurkiw Chrystia Chudczak\n\nIt was 2019. And the successful TV comedian turned commander in chief had traveled to Paris for a summit to negotiate a peace deal with Putin. Despite the doubts of many, Zelensky managed to walk away giving few concessions.\n\nAlready, there were clues as to the type of leader who earlier this month was named TIME magazine’s “Person of the Year.”\n\nIn Paris at the time, I witnessed how Zelensky pulled up to the Élysée Palace in a modest Renault, while Putin motored in with an ostentatious armored limousine. (The host, French President Emmanuel Macron, hugged Putin but chose only to shake hands with Zelensky).\n\nZelensky, like his persona in the comedy series “Servant of the People,” was the type of populist leader who favored riding his bicycle to work.\n\nA prisoner swap with Russia shortly after the summit seemed to favor Zelensky, who said at the time it was a first step towards ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which had started in 2014 and claimed the lives of over 14,000 people.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin's first in person meeting, Paris, December 2019. Ian Langsdon/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFast forward to 2022 and Zelensky is the instantly recognizable wartime president in trademark olive green; as adept at rallying his citizens and stirring the imaginations of folks worldwide, as naming and shaming allies dragging their feet in arming his military.\n\nBut almost 10 months into Russia’s full-scale invasion, and with Putin’s forces clearly on the back foot, Zelensky’s biggest test is yet to come.\n\nAs the war grinds into a new year, Zelensky faces a fresh dilemma. How to balance growing pressure from outside for a ceasefire and negotiations with Russia, and expectations within Ukraine for a full Russian withdrawal to pre-2014 lines.\n\nFailure to demonstrate further progress on the battlefield with billions of dollars worth of military kit could stir unease among Western backers. But capitulation to Russia would be a political death sentence.\n\nTaking on the bullies\n\nIn a new book looking at the Ukrainian president’s speeches, the Economist’s Eastern European editor, Arkady Ostrovsky, describes Zelensky as “an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances.”\n\nHowever, that doesn’t tell the whole story.\n\nZelensky’s upbringing in the rough and tumble neighborhoods of Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine shaped him into a scrappy kid who learned how to respond to bullies.\n\n“After the full-scale invasion, once he got into a position of being bullied by someone like Vladimir Putin he knew exactly what he needed to do because it was just his gut feeling,” Yevhen Hlibovytsky, former political journalist and founder of the Kyiv-based think tank and consultancy, pro.mova, told me.\n\nThis, after all, is the leader who when offered evacuation by the US as Russia launched its full-scale invasion, quipped: “I need ammunition, not a ride.”\n\nIt is perhaps easy to forget that Zelensky honed his political muscles earlier in his career standing up to another bully in 2019 – then-US President Donald Trump, who tried to bamboozle the novice politician in the quid pro quo scandal.\n\nAmid the fog of war, it all seems a long, long way since the heady campaign celebration in a repurposed Kyiv nightclub where a fresh-faced Zelensky thanked his supporters for a landslide victory. Standing on stage among the fluttering confetti, he looked in a state of disbelief at having defeated incumbent veteran politician Petro Poroshenko.\n\nAlready, we were wondering how this new president might handle the giant aggressor on his border.\n\nPoll-vaulting to fame\n\nIn the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion, Zelensky was in a steep, downward trajectory in popularity ratings from the all-time high in the first days of his administration.\n\nAs Russian troops began to amass on Ukraine’s borders in the weeks preceding the February assault, around 55% of Ukrainians said they didn’t trust Zelensky to lead them into war. It was a rating likely influenced by him not keeping some of his campaign promises, especially failing to launch an effective fight against corruption in the judiciary.\n\nThe war appears to have turned his ratings around. Just days after the invasion, Zelensky’s ratings approval surged to 90%, and remain high to this day. Even Americans early in the war rated Zelensky highly for his handling of international affairs – ahead of US President Joe Biden.\n\nIt is difficult to calculate how much the carefully managed stagecraft of the president’s inner circle has contributed to Zelensky’s popular image both inside and outside Ukraine – but it certainly can’t hurt.\n\nHis bubble includes many people from his previous professional life as a TV comedian in the theatrical group Kvartal 95. Even in the midst of the war, a press conference held on the platform of a Kyiv metro station in April featured perfect lighting and curated camera angles to emphasize a wartime setting.\n\nAs for his skills as comforter in chief, I remember well the solace his nightly televised addresses brought in the midst of air raid sirens and explosions in Lviv.\n\nWar-time fashion icon\n\nBeyond the man himself, there is Zelensky the brand. It’s almost impossible these days to dissociate the Ukrainian leader from his olive green t-shirts; worn when meeting everyone from Vogue journalists to military commanders and world leaders.\n\n“By wearing T-shirts and hoodies, the youthful, egalitarian uniform of Silicon Valley, rather than suits, Zelensky is projecting confidence and competence in a modern way, to a younger, global audience that recognizes it as such,” Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell, a fashion historian and author of “Red, White, and Blue on the Runway: The 1968 White House Fashion Show and the Politics of American Style,” told NPR.\n\n“He is probably more comfortable than Putin on camera, too, both as an actor and as a digital native,” she added. “I believe both of them want to come across as relatable, not aloof or untouchable, although Zelensky is definitely doing a better job balancing authority with accessibility.”\n\nWith Zelensky effectively grounded in Ukraine, his wife and first lady, Olena Zelenska, has become a powerful ambassador for the brand abroad.\n\nThen-presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife Olena Zelenska, March 2019. Ukrinform/Abaca Press/Sipa USA/AP\n\nJourneying to where her husband can’t, Zelenska has shown herself to be an effective communicator in international fora – projecting empathy, style and smarts. Most recently, she met with King Charles during a visit to a refugee assistance center at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in London. (Curiously, TIME magazine did not include Zelenska on the cover montage and gave only a passing reference in the supporting text).\n\nDespite the strong tailwinds at Zelensky’s back, there are subtle signs that his international influence could be dwindling. For example, last week, in what analysts called a pivotal moment in geopolitics, the G7 imposed a $60 a barrel price cap on Russian crude – despite pleas from Zelensky that it should have been set at $30 in order to inflict more pain on the Kremlin.\n\nWithin Ukraine, the economy continues to stumble from the impact of war and persistent missile and drone attacks on critical power infrastructure – including at least 76 strikes on Friday. As winter bites, millions of Ukrainians are enduring long periods without heat, electricity and water. (However, indicative of the resiliency that Ukrainians have displayed since the start of the war, many say they are prepared to endure such hardship for another two to five years if it means defeating Russia).\n\nThe biggest test to come\n\nAll this adds up to a complex path ahead for the Zelensky administration, especially if liberating Crimea from Russia is part of the definition of victory envisioned by most Ukrainians. For the time being, and true to form, the tough guy from Kryvyi Rih shows no sign of backing down.\n\n“Paradoxically, Zelensky achieved the thing that Putin most wanted to achieve but failed … to rally support domestically with a patriotic war in order to deflect and distract from his abject failures at home. In Putin’s mind, to be shown up by a mere ‘decadent’ comedian must be excruciatingly painful for him,” New York-based geopolitical and business analyst Michael Popow told me.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nVictory will surely depend on the West maintaining a united front against Russia. Zelensky and his envoys abroad have done an enviable job of warning Western leaders that if they don’t support Ukraine in pushing Putin back completely, their own nations’ security could be caught in the crosshairs of Russian aggression.\n\nAs Zelensky said in a recent nightly video address: “No matter what the aggressor intends to do, when the world is truly united, it is then the world, not the aggressor, determines how events develop.”", "authors": ["Michael Bociurkiw"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}]}

A single case tied to travel has exploded into 14 infections and counting, with no way to know how many were exposed while supply shortages forced the entire state to briefly suspend testing.\n\nConfirmed cases in New York City, where hospitals have fallen into chaos as resources run thin, on Thursday surpassed Beadle’s entire population of 18,500. With too few tests for too many cases, doctors there already had been told it no longer made sense to test most ill patients.\n\nFrom its biggest cities to its smallest towns, America’s chance to contain the coronavirus crisis came and went in the seven weeks since U.S. health officials botched the testing rollout and then misled scientists in state laboratories about this critical early failure. Federal regulators failed to recognize the spiraling disaster and were slow to relax the rules that prevented labs and major hospitals from advancing a backup.\n\nScientists around the country found themselves shackled as the disease spread.\n\n“We were watching a tsunami and standing there frozen,” said Dr. Debra Wadford, director of the public viral disease laboratory in California, where some of the country's earliest patients were identified.\n\nThe nation’s public health pillars — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration — shirked their responsibility to protect Americans in an emergency like this new coronavirus, USA TODAY found in interviews with dozens of scientists, public health experts and community leaders, as well as email communications between laboratories and hospitals across the country.\n\nThe result was a cascading series of failures now costing lives.\n\nGet daily coronavirus updates in your inbox: Sign up for our newsletter now.\n\nCDC leaders not only bungled their role in developing the first coronavirus test permitted in the country, they also misrepresented the efficacy of early solutions to state health authorities.\n\nThen, public and private lab directors felt rebuffed by the FDA when they first offered to help troubleshoot the problem by developing their own tests. The agency, through its emergency authority, had placed restrictions on labs that can apply in emergencies but not in normal circumstances.\n\nIn a statement to USA Today, FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said validating outside tests is essential in a crisis when \"false results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences.\"\n\nA reliable, accessible test was key to averting today’s disaster. Countries such as South Korea had already shown how such diagnostics — developed and scaled up with the help of the private sector at the onset — could be used to identify people with early infections before they spread the virus widely.\n\nIn late February, the CDC's deputy director of infectious disease projected calm in a conference call with state laboratories. The labs were told they could now send samples to the CDC and receive results within 24 hours.\n\n“That was a bald-faced lie,” said Wadford. At that point, she was waiting four to five days on test results for samples she had sent to the CDC.\n\n“The most disappointing part was that they couldn’t just be frank and straight with us,” said Wadford, who took detailed notes of the conference call that she dictated to USA TODAY. “Tell us the situation. Don’t sugarcoat it and lie. But to mislead us is just not right.”\n\nThe following week, President Trump tweeted: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”\n\nSince then, the U.S. went from 51 confirmed cases to more than 100,000, from zero deaths to over 1,900 as of Friday, while the economic toll of shuttering wide swaths of the country has cost millions their jobs and pummeled the stock market.\n\nBrett Murphy and Letitia Stein are reporters on the USA TODAY national investigations team. Contact Brett at brett.murphy@usatoday.com or Letitia at lstein@usatoday.com.\n\nCaccomo denied that the FDA was overly restrictive at the onset of the outbreak and then slow to adapt to the \"unprecedented public health emergency.” The agency worked with outside labs as early as Jan. 22, she said, before opening up the emergency authorization process at the end of February.\n\n\"As the emergency evolved,\" Caccomo added, \"FDA determined that the benefits of increased testing capacity outweighed the risks associated with use of additional tests.\"\n\nThe time lost in February was critical to containing the outbreak and helping hospitals prepare, experts say. With each delay, the virus spread undetected as people likely unaware of an infection attended conferences and weddings, frequented bars and restaurants and took long-planned cruise vacations.\n\nAmerica is now paying the price. More than half of the country’s population has been ordered to stay home to slow the spread. Doctors are rationing supplies. Like New York City, communities have limited testing because the outbreak has grown so large that hospitals must instead target the most vulnerable.\n\nFrom Texas to New York –– the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak –– medical facilities burned through protective supplies, including masks, almost immediately, in part because doctors did not have widespread access to tests a month ago, forcing them to take extensive precautions with all patients showing symptoms.\n\nNew York City health officials now recommend against testing patients who do not require hospitalization, even if they have symptoms such as fever, to preserve limited resources. In viral social media posts, doctors describe hospitals overrun with the sick and dying. Patients with symptoms wait in clinic lines for up to 11 hours to get tested.\n\nDr. Alan Bigman, who runs a multi-speciality medical practice there, has agonized over an impossible position: pull patients away from jobs and out of the community without a diagnosis or risk running out of testing supplies for the next person who walks into the clinic.\n\n“They have kids, and they have neighbors,” he said. “I need to know if they are positive or not.”\n\nHealthcare workers: Tell us your coronavirus story\n\nThe crisis may soon be just as dire in rural communities. As of mid-March, Dr. April Abbott, the microbiology lab director at the largest hospital chain in southern Indiana, said she could not get equipment to run her own tests, in part because the federal government does not consider her area a priority like New York or California.\n\nHotspots could be hiding across the country. Smart thermometer company, Kinsa, recently noted an unusually high volume of fevers in east Texas and northern New Mexico, for instance, places where reported infections – and tests – remain low.\n\n“We're not able to get testing supplies because we can't prove we need them,” Abbott said, “And we can't prove we need them because we can't perform the tests.”\n\nAbbott initially looked into sending her Deaconess Hospital patients’ samples to other labs. But the state-run lab told her they were too overwhelmed by a bottleneck of demand to take them. Increasingly alarmed, she sent emails to private companies pleading for them to loan her equipment to run tests.\n\n“Below Indianapolis, our state has virtually no functional testing capability,” Abbott wrote to a diagnostics company on March 16. “I cannot overemphasize the lack of testing available in our region.”\n\nEventually she found labs in other states to take her samples, but results took almost two weeks.\n\n“The infrastructure has failed us,” Abbott said in an interview. As of mid-week, Indiana had confirmed just 645 cases of coronavirus.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised in South Dakota, where the resource-strapped state lab has lagged far behind others. Fewer than 2,200 test results were reported by the state as of Thursday, with 46 confirmed positive.\n\nHealth officials there had to suspend testing briefly just as its cases started to rise because the government's lab — then the only in-state option — ran out of testing supplies.\n\n“I am absolutely appalled at what is going on,” said Ashley Kingdon-Reese, a home health care operator in Huron, South Dakota, who knows about a patient with likely exposure who continued to visit with family.\n\nShe fears the community was broadly exposed by these kinds of comings and goings while tests were backlogged.\n\nPeople who could be spreading the virus, she said, “have been in the public the whole time.”\n\nFederal testing push falls behind\n\nSince early January, a virus raging in China had the attention of public health experts. A coronavirus, it was the newest member of a large family of viruses whose evils include the common cold. The name refers to how it looks under a microscope, with crown-like spikes on its surface.\n\nU.S. intelligence communities soon began warning of a global pandemic, which The Washington Post reported last week was downplayed by the Trump administration.\n\nAfter the first American case turned up in Seattle in late January, an infectious disease expert there began asking state and federal officials to let her repurpose nasal swab flu tests for the new coronavirus. The answer, the New York Times reported: no.\n\nTwenty-plus years of public health preparedness drills dictated what the government should have done next: mobilize state, hospital and commercial laboratories to develop testing to isolate the sick and buy time for hospitals to activate plans for handling a surge.\n\n“When you see a disaster coming, you want to go big and go now,” said Dr. Tara O’Toole, who helped develop pandemic response plans in the Department of Homeland Security under former President Barack Obama.\n\nBut for weeks, the federal testing push fell further and further behind.\n\nOn Jan. 31, after Americans began returning stateside from the outbreak’s origin in Wuhan, China, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency, but called the threat to this country “low.”\n\nShortly after, the FDA gave the CDC authority through an emergency use authorization to begin rolling out a diagnostic test kit for the state public health labs.\n\nIf any scientists at universities, the public labs or private facilities wanted to develop their own tests — which they sometimes call “home brew” — or adopt the World Health Organization’s, they would need to submit separate applications with 28 pages of guidelines.\n\nLabs found the process more burdensome than any other regulation they deal with.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, scientists can run various tests without special FDA approval. But emergency orders shift the regulatory landscape, imposing restrictions. Experts say the agency moved far too slowly to lift them, given the magnitude of the building crisis.\n\nInstead, the FDA stuck with one of the most restrictive approaches possible, according to Dr. Josh Sharfstein, a former deputy commissioner at FDA.\n\n“The response has been backwards,” said Sharfstein, now vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University, who advocates for more regulation during non-emergencies and less in urgent situations like this one.\n\nThe FDA, an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services, regulates according to laws passed by Congress and guidance laid out by the administration. Yet Trump has blamed the initial approach on the prior administration, which he said created barriers that made it difficult to rapidly ramp up testing.\n\n“I don’t take responsibility at all,” he said at a news conference two weeks ago.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment and directed USA TODAY to the health department, which also did not respond.\n\nDr. Margaret Hamburg, who served as commissioner of the FDA under former president Barack Obama and helped oversee the agency’s response to the H1N1 flu outbreak, said there was nothing stopping the administration from acting sooner.\n\n“I’ve been confused by those characterizations of the FDA’s inability to move swiftly in a crisis,” Hamburg said.\n\nFlawed test, then flawed response\n\nThe federal emergency declaration allowed the CDC to begin distributing test kits to state health department labs across the nation in early February.\n\nRight away, a problem surfaced. California received its kits on a Friday. Scientists worked through the weekend, discovering that some components of the CDC’s test were flawed and produced inconclusive results.\n\nThe issue centered on one of the three testing components, or reagents, used to detect the new virus, COVID-19.\n\nOn Sunday, Wadford, one of the directors of the California public health lab, frantically messaged colleagues at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. She wanted to know if other labs had encountered the same problem.\n\n“We are hearing of it from at least one state lab,” an official from the laboratory association wrote back in an email. “Seems like it might be real.”\n\nThe CDC promised to quickly fix the test. But for two weeks, the agency offered temporary solutions — such as creating a new “surge” lab and offering to receive samples at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.\n\nThose patches themselves were so flawed that results that took days were often inconclusive, too, according to Wadford. At one point, the surge lab also failed to immediately notify the state labs of positive cases by phone, as they had done earlier in crises.\n\nThe CDC has acknowledged problems with its testing development.\n\n\"This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in late February.\n\nNoting that the U.S. had few cases at the time, she added: \"To date, our strategies have been largely successful.\"\n\nThe agency did not respond to a request for additional comment under deadline.\n\nBy the third week of February, still with no permanent solution in place, the FDA was well aware of the problem.\n\nOn Feb. 24 — the same day Trump tweeted “the Coronavirus is very much under control” — Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, sent a letter to the FDA begging the agency to scale back its original strategy and lift the home-brew restrictions preventing them from making their own tests.\n\nAround the same time, more than 100 scientists in private labs and universities penned a similar letter to Congress.\n\n“They are first responders with lab coats and they couldn’t actually gown up,” Becker said in an interview, calling the situation at that stage desperate.\n\nOn Feb. 29, the administration changed course and began rolling back the restrictions. The new strategy allowed both private and public labs to use a modified version of the CDC test and start developing their own.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks, the FDA continued to ease restrictions to make it easier for others to come online with tests, including commercial laboratories.\n\nExperts criticize the agency, however, for moving slowly given the magnitude of the health epidemic unfolding.\n\n“CDC tests were never supposed to meet the entire need for the U.S.,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director, noting that commercial labs and hospitals play critical roles in reaching the scale required in a major epidemic such as the new coronavirus.\n\nDuring these lost weeks in February, federal officials missed their chance to contain the outbreak before it swept across the country, unseen.\n\nAs testing ramped up, states found themselves behind\n\nAt Texas Children’s Hospital, doctors lament the weeks that passed without an in-house test to show in hours, not days, what they were dealing with.\n\nDr. Jim Dunn, director of medical microbiology and virology at the hospital, had developed lab tests for the Zika virus for weeks before the FDA stepped in. He said the restrictions this time prevented Texas Children’s from getting out in front of COVID-19.\n\n“They pulled the plug before we even had a chance to get going,” said Dunn, noting that the hospital expended resources in the early days when doctors didn’t know who did and didn’t have the virus. “It could have affected how the masks were allocated.”\n\nSouth Dakota, initially appearing largely untouched by the epidemic, nonetheless rallied its emergency planners.\n\nIn Beadle County, the Huron Regional Medical Center rolled out a testing protocol that leaders now acknowledge was aggressive to the point of overuse.\n\nClinicians burned through supplies, using four nasal swabs to run testing for COVID-19 and other respiratory concerns. The protocol was eventually scaled back to one swab per nostril, then one per patient.\n\nAs the state lab backlogged, with limited supplies to process the tests, people with suspected cases were urged to self-quarantine.\n\n“When we started out, there was no shortage of supplies,” said Dr. Jake Redden, the hospital’s vice president of quality, who coordinated with state health officials.\n\nTesting hit a snag just as an early cluster of travel-related cases surfaced in the county of 18,500 people within a state whose entire population is less than 900,000.\n\nLacking a crucial chemical used to process the test, in short supply nationally, South Dakota’s public testing lab posted a notice online last Wednesday that it had temporarily suspended testing.\n\n“It was alarming,” said Dr. Robert Summerer, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association.\n\nThe lack of test data presented a challenge for members of the association, who were trying to draft guidelines for the governor on closing restaurants and cancelling elective surgeries. No one knew whether the state really had few cases or was clueless for lack of test results.\n\nOther states had commercial and hospital-based labs running, but South Dakota still lacked an in-state backup.\n\nThe day after the state halted testing, Republican governor Kristi Noem told the White House on a conference call that it had been juggling shortage issues for two weeks.\n\nShe described how the CDC kept directing the state to private suppliers, which would cancel orders for the chemical reagent at the last minute. After getting “a little pushy,” she said enough supplies had come in for her state to resume processing tests.\n\n“I need to understand how you’re triaging supplies,” she told the White House, according to a transcript of the call. “I just don’t want to not be a priority area, because we’re a smaller state or less populated.”\n\n“It will never happen to your state,” Trump responded.\n\nWith limited supplies, however, the state lab focused on processing cases identified as higher priority. As of early this week, authorities were awaiting results from 700 tests sent out of state to be processed by labs with four- to five-day turnaround times.\n\nBeadle County’s cases already had multiplied as test results came back.\n\nThe day before the governor’s White House call, Beadle County had a single case.\n\nOn the day that Noem spoke with Trump, the count rose to four.\n\nBy Sunday, when city and county officials voted in an emergency session to shut down restaurants, gyms and movie theaters, there were 10.\n\nTesting has ramped up within the state this week. So has fear.\n\nThe mayor of Beadle’s county seat, Huron, issued a news release to combat rumors circulating on social media that the virus had arrived in their community via its significant population of Karen immigrants from Myanmar. He noted the cases reported to that point all were white residents.\n\n“If we’d have had better testing supplies,” Huron Mayor Paul Aylward told USA TODAY, “we could have been ahead of this curve.”\n\nData reporter Kevin Crowe contributed to this report.\n\nBrett Murphy and Letitia Stein are reporters on the USA TODAY national investigations team.

Police already are “depleted and exhausted,” and leaders don’t want to add to restrictions that already include early closing times and crowd limits at nightspots, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said. But the sight of crowds like those that gathered near campus in an area called The Strip are disheartening after officials spent weeks pleading with people to take steps that will slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, Maddox said. Maddox’s comments came after University of Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne tweeted a photo that showed dozens of people, many not wearing face masks or staying away from others, waiting to get into a popular bar in Tuscaloosa on the day sororities accepted new members. “Who wants college sports this fall?? Obviously not these people!! We’ve got to do better than this for each other and our campus community. Please wear your masks!” Byrne said in a tweet Sunday. Tuscaloosa police officers issued 12 citations for mask violations and arrested four people, but the problem wasn’t just at the University of Alabama: Photos on social media also showed large crowds and relatively few masks around Auburn University over the weekend.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Travel on an Alaska ferry was temporarily suspended after the vessel transported passengers who tested positive for COVID-19, officials said. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities announced sailings by the M/V Matanuska are suspended until Monday, The Juneau Empire reported. The transportation department said in a statement that five passengers who traveled aboard the Matanuska last week tested positive for the virus. The ferry’s crew was required to receive negative test results before the ship resumes service, the department said. On Monday, the department said tests on all 47 crew members returned negative. Passengers who had tickets for the canceled sailings this week were being notified and either rescheduled or refunded, the department said. The passengers are believed to have been infectious while traveling on the Matanuska, which embarked from Kake, traveled through Sitka and arrived in Juneau on Aug. 10. While the ship was in transit, the crew learned some passengers had been in close contact with an individual in Kake who had tested positive, the department said. The passengers were quarantined in their cabins and provided room service until arriving in Juneau, in accordance with protocols, the department said. The passengers informed the department they had tested positive and the department informed other passengers and the public out of an abundance of caution. State health officials recommended recent travelers on the Matanuska self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and take extra precautions.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: The Navajo Nation has lifted its stay-at-home order but is encouraging residents to leave their homes only for emergencies or essential activities. The stay-at-home order was rescinded Sunday, when 24 additional coronavirus cases and zero deaths were reported. Tribal officials on Monday reported 12 new COVID-19 cases but zero deaths again. The numbers are a vast change from earlier this year, when the tribe had one of the highest per-capita rates of infection in the U.S. The tribe’s executive branch released its reopening plan last week. Although some tourist destinations partially overseen by the federal government reopened Monday, tribal officials discouraged visitors from off the reservation. The National Park Service said it is working within the tribe’s guidelines but could not police who visits Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Chinle, Navajo National Monument near Shonto and Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site in Ganado. Limited services such as restrooms, self-guided trails and overlooks were open. Tribal parks such as Monument Valley and the Four Corners Monument were not open, Navajo President Jonathan Nez said Monday. Representatives for Nez didn’t respond to requests for further comment.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Dr. Deborah Birx, President Donald Trump’s top coronavirus adviser, said friends and families holding parties are driving the virus’s spread in the community, issuing the warning as outbreaks at some colleges across the country are being tied to large gatherings. Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, urged people to wear masks and socially distance after visiting with Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state health officials, pointing to the gatherings as a particular concern. Arkansas’ Health Department on Monday reported 412 new virus cases and four more deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Hutchinson said ensuring college students in Arkansas don’t have large parties like the ones Birx warned of is a challenge. “This is where the universities need to educate and they also need to have a plan whenever a student doesn’t behave properly or carefully,” Hutchinson said. Arkansas’ K-12 public schools are set to resume classes next week. Although schools are allowed to offer virtual classes or a hybrid option that includes some onsite classes, the state is requiring schools to be open five days a week for students who need in-person instruction. Birx stopped short of weighing in on that approach, but said offering the students the option of virtual learning decreases the number of students in the classroom.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Los Angeles Unified School District will launch an aggressive coronavirus testing and contact tracing program for all students, staff and their families as part of a broad plan to safely reopen campuses. No date has been set for reopening schools in the nation’s second-largest district. The academic year formally begins this week with distance learning. The spread of COVID-19 in the Los Angeles area still exceeds state guidelines governing the possible return of students to campuses. The testing and tracing plan announced Sunday will provide data that can be used as a guide for renewing school operations, Superintendent Austin Beutner wrote in an opinion article for the Los Angeles Times. Tests will first be given to staff working at schools, as well as to any of their children participating in child care provided for Los Angeles Unified employees. Testing will also be provided to family members of students and staff who test positive for the coronavirus and family members who show symptoms. In the event of a positive test, contact can be made with others in the school community to quickly isolate the virus, Beutner wrote.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The beginning of Colorado State University’s move-in week is far different this year. Students are being tested for COVID-19 and required to wear masks or other facial coverings inside – outside, too, if social distancing can’t be maintained. And instead of having as many as 4,000 students moving in on a single day during the usual two-day window, they’re arriving and moving belongings into their rooms in small groups at preassigned times throughout the week. “It’s definitely going to be different,” said Martika Hererra, a freshman from Artesia, New Mexico. “It’s just a new way of life, because we all have to wear masks and do different things. There are different regulations and laws. It’s not our usual way of life and doing things.” Hererra and her parents, Rachel and Ben, had no reservations, though, about moving her into Piñon Hall during her assigned time Monday. “I’m more excited than anything,” Martika said. Students began the move-in process Monday, with even the largest residence halls – 12-story Westfall and Durward – limiting access to 15 students per hour and limiting each student to a maximum of two helpers. Move-in times begin at 8 a.m. and end at 9 p.m. daily through Friday, said Tonie Miyamoto, the director of communications and sustainability for CSU’s housing and dining services. Residence hall capacity has been reduced for the semester from 6,300 beds to about 5,600, Miyamoto said, to allow for more social distancing in community areas and to set aside living spaces with separate entrances for any students who might need to be quarantined because of a positive COVID-19 test or close contact with someone who tests positive.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUncasville: The Mohegan Sun casino said it will lay off an unspecified number of employees because of impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. The southeastern Connecticut casino on sovereign tribal land opened June 1 despite opposition from Gov. Ned Lamont over the potential danger of spreading the virus in large group settings. About 3,000 of roughly 5,000 workers returned to work at that time. The company said it is ending its furlough program on Sept. 30. Mohegan Sun President & General Manager Jeff Hamilton said the move will reduce their workforce among employees who have not been called back to work before the end of September.“This difficult decision came after careful consideration and was driven by the unprecedented circumstances created by the pandemic, including reduced capacity and the inability to open all of the property amenities,” Hamilton said in a prepared statement reported by NBC Connecticut.The company said it was working with employees to find new positions.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State health officials said that coronavirus-related hospitalizations have fallen to below 30 for the first time. The Delaware State News reported Monday that there were 29 hospitalizations. The numbers come from the Delaware Division of Public Health. Seven of the hospitalizations are considered critical. Delaware has recorded more than 16,000 positive COVID-19 cases. New Castle County has seen the most. It has 7,580 cases. Sussex County has recorded 6,197, Kent County has had 2,496. There are 263 cases where the county is not yet known.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the District will expand its number of contact tracers by 175, bringing the total to 450, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. health officials said contact tracers will begin conducting home visits starting on Thursday for cases in which individuals were reached but did not complete an interview, or were unable to be reached. The home visits will allow investigators to assess the need for additional social services.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June on Monday as the number of people hospitalized continued to fall. The state reported 2,678 new confirmed cases, a level the state hasn’t seen since June 17 just as Florida began a monthlong surge of new infections that peaked at 15,300 on July 12. The seven-day average for new cases is now about 3,600, down from 11,000 a month ago. Also, the number of people being treated in Florida hospitals for COVID-19 has been declining since highs above 9,500 on July 23. The number of patients in the late morning Monday stood at 5,657, according to a total posted online by the state. The state reported 87 deaths Monday, bringing the total since the outbreak was first reported in Florida on March 1 to at least 9,674. Mondays are typically low numbers for deaths as some hospitals don’t report over the weekend.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A longtime county commissioner in Georgia died Monday after more than two weeks in the hospital fighting the coronavirus. Chatham County Commissioner James Holmes of Savannah was 82. His wife, Yvonne, confirmed his death to news outlets. She said her husband had been hospitalized with COVID-19 since July 30. “This is something of a reminder, and I don’t think we need this occasion to remind folks of it, of how serious the coronavirus really is,” Al Scott, chairman of the Chatham County Commission, told reporters at a news conference. Holmes was a former high school basketball coach who had also worked as an assistant coach at Savannah State University. Scott said that Holmes planned to leave office at the end of the year after serving on the commission since 2005.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Anastasiya Kamaletdinova spent her first day of eighth grade at Kaimuki Middle School on Monday on a computer in her bedroom. “I was more shy than usual,” Kamaletdinova , 13, said. “Everything was great except for the last 20 minutes, I had problems with my computer and I couldn’t hear my teacher for some reason.” Like many public school students across Hawaii, she started the new academic year remotely as coronavirus cases are surging on Oahu, where Honolulu is located. The statewide teachers union led an effort to delay the first day for students by two weeks. At the union’s urging, the Hawaii Department of Education announced most schools would start the first four weeks online. The union is still concerned there are students on campuses this week. Education officials said some students will be on campuses for things such as picking up learning materials and learning how to use technology for remote instruction. This week, Aikahi Elementary on Oahu’s windward side is welcoming small groups of students for a few hours each day for orientation, training on distance learning systems and connecting with teachers and friends, said Principal Keoki Fraser. The union warned some teachers would be using personal or sick leave to avoid jeopardizing health and safety. Fraser said all his teachers were present Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A school district in southwestern Idaho has announced plans to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic despite recommendations against doing so from local health officials. The New Plymouth School District Board voted 4-1 on Aug. 10 to reopen classrooms five days a week to about 1,000 students starting Aug. 24, the Idaho Statesman reported Monday. However, Southwest District Health reported that Payette County has the highest level of community spread, which comes with a recommendation to close school buildings. New Plymouth is located in Payette County, about 50 miles northwest of Boise. Board Chairman Marc Haws scrutinized the community’s latest COVID-19 data, reviewed a parent survey and weighed the risk of the coronavirus against the impact of more lost time in the classroom and did not find a compelling reason to keep the schools closed. Haws said the district considered recommendations from the local health department but argued that the school board has the ultimate responsibility to open or close the schools. New Plymouth Superintendent David Sotutu said everyone at the schools will be required to wear facial coverings and practice social distancing. Sotutu also said masks will be offered, sanitation procedures will be increased and students will have the option to learn solely online.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State public health officials on Monday launched a COVID-19 hot spot map for travelers to assess their risk before leaving the state. The online map shows which U.S. states have an average daily case rate of at least 15 cases per 100,000 people, which is considered higher risk. “This virus does not recognize borders and specific regions and it doesn’t stop at the edge of a region or a county,” Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said at an East St. Louis news conference. “We know that people may have to travel, but potentially based on where you may go that travel may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19.” She urged travelers to factor in details like how to safely manage airport terminals and rest areas.\n\nIndiana\n\nRockville: The Parke County Board of Commissioners voted to cancel this year’s Covered Bridge Festival because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commissioners voted 2-0 on Monday, with one member abstaining to cancel the event that had been scheduled for Oct. 9-18, the Tribune-Star reported. Commissioner Bruce Hartman said he had spoken to many local health care and emergency management professionals recently and had “come to the conclusion there is a absolutely a risk to the people of Parke County.” Hartman said he had heard from residents on both sides of the issue but not one had presented a solid reason to hold the festival other than the income it generates. As one resident pointed out to him, Hartman said, “Money’s no good if you’re dead” from the coronavirus. The festival in years past has attracted as many as 1 million visitors to the rustic western Indiana county to enjoy its 31 covered bridges. Commissioner Jim Meece agreed with Hartman, saying there was no realistic way the county could enforce or hope to achieve anti-COVID measures recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Gov. Eric Holcomb and the State Department of Health.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A state agency said it is working to fix a data error on Iowa’s coronavirus website that lowers the number of new confirmed cases and therefore downplays the severity of the outbreak, just as schools are deciding whether to reopen. The glitch means the Iowa Department of Public Health has inadvertently been reporting fewer new infections and a smaller percentage of daily positive tests than is the case, according to Dana Jones, an Iowa City nurse practitioner who uncovered the problem. It’s particularly significant because school districts are relying on state data to determine whether they will offer in-person instruction when school resumes in the coming days and weeks. Potentially thousands of coronavirus infections from recent weeks and months have instead been erroneously recorded as having happened in March, April, May and June, Jones said Monday. The numbers are skewed because some people tested negative earlier but recently tested positive. Iowa’s system has been recording their new positive results as having happened when their original negative results were reported. “It’s one of the worst data errors that could be happening right now,” said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician in Fort Dodge, Iowa. “We are making these policy calls based on completely flawed numbers and that needs to be acknowledged.” An Iowa Department of Public Health official confirmed the glitch in an email to Jones Friday. He said a system-generated date when test results are reported to the state stays the same when an individual later tests positive. But the state has yet to publicly announce the error. Amy McCoy, a spokeswoman for the public health department, told the Associated Press that she hoped to have more information about the issue soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly imposed a new ban on evictions and foreclosures on home mortgages in Kansas because one federal program to aid unemployed workers has expired and she isn’t sure that the state will participate in an alternative offered by President Donald Trump Kelly’s order prevents landlords and lenders from initiating efforts to remove people from their apartments or homes if they can’t pay their rent or make their mortgage payments because of financial problems resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kelly’s executive order took effect Monday and is remains in effect until Sept. 15. The governor said she might extend the order longer if Congress does not approve another coronavirus relief package. She also said that she recognizes that her new order will burden landlords and home lenders, and her administration has started to look for ways to provide relief to them. A federal program providing an additional $600 a week to unemployed workers expired at the end of July. Trump issued an executive order earlier this month offering $300 a week in extra benefits, with an extra $100 available to jobless workers if states cover the cost. Kansas has yet to sign up for either version, and Kelly questioned whether Trump has the power to bypass Congress.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky should accept a supplemental $300 in federal weekly assistance for its unemployed workers under a White House offer that won’t require any extra spending by the state, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a letter to the state’s Democratic governor. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, noted in his Monday letter to Gov. Andy Beshear that some states – including some led by Democratic governors – have started accepting the assistance. McConnell added that “Kentucky must not be left behind.” “All you need to do is sign up,” McConnell, the chief congressional ally to President Donald Trump, said in his letter. Kentucky and other states were hit by surging unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic. The option recently provided by the White House involves less than the $600 a week in federal aid that unemployment recipients received until the assistance expired on Aug 1. Congress has been unable to agree on an extension amid an impasse on a new round of coronavirus aid. Trump issued a series of executive orders, including the lower supplemental unemployment payments, after negotiations broke down over the new relief bill. Another option for Kentucky and other states is to tap into federal aid already provided under the coronavirus rescue package to raise the extra weekly payment to $400 for unemployment claimants, McConnell said. McConnell was a chief architect of the massive relief provided under the measure. Kentucky recipients will still receive regular state unemployment benefits under the options. Beshear responded later Monday that his administration had reviewed the application and “put together a draft” but still needed “clarity” on some points in the program.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge in New Orleans refused to block a state order closing bars to stop the spread of COVID-19, handing a defeat to 10 southeast Louisiana bar owners who had sued to stop the closure. U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman said the closure order was legal under the broad powers a governor has under public health emergencies such as the pandemic. Feldman, a judge in the federal court system’s Eastern District of Louisiana, ruled even as a hearing in a similar suit played out in the Western District. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, who issued the order last month, was testifying in that lawsuit Monday afternoon, according to a Twitter post by an Edwards spokeswoman. The hearing was before U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays in Lafayette, where 11 bar owners were fighting the closure order. Feldman heard arguments Friday. “The case turns on a classic who-decides question: As between democratically accountable state officials and a federal court, who decides what measures best protect Louisianans during a global pandemic?” Feldman wrote. “The answer is state officials.” It is unknown when Summerhays will rule. Feldman said federal court precedent makes clear that “the bar owners cannot succeed on the merits of their claim that the Governor’s enforcement of the ban of on-site consumption of food or drinks at ‘bars’ violates their constitutional rights.”\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: Two dozen Maine residents tested positive for the coronavirus after a wedding reception in Millinocket – the state’s first outbreak linked to a social gathering, officials said Monday. Eighteen people who attended the Aug. 7 reception and six others who had close contact with attendees subsequently tested positive, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control. All told, about 65 people attended the indoor event at the Big Moose Inn, said Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long. The governor’s executive orders put in place during the global pandemic limit indoor gatherings to 50 people if there’s adequate space, and 100 people are allowed at outdoor events. Attendees should also follow physical distancing guidelines and wear masks while not eating. The Maine CDC was communicating with Big Moose Inn about the nature of the event and adherence to state requirements. A telephone message was left at the inn on Monday afternoon. Millinocket Town Manager John Davis said Monday that he didn’t have all the details about the outbreak, but said there was enough concern to close the town hall and local schools as a precaution. It’s unknown if the owner of the Big Moose Inn could be cited if it’s confirmed there were too many people at the reception. The governor’s executive orders allow for a fine of up to $10,000, the governor’s spokeswoman said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:SunFest, the city’s “biggest and best festival,” won’t go on as planned in 2020, becoming yet another event to be postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. SunFest is an annual festival that brings artists, musicians and food vendors to the Ocean City Inlet each fall. This year’s event was scheduled for Oct. 1-4. The Ocean City Mayor and Town Council unanimously voted Monday night to postpone SunFest after a long discussion about the festival’s viability given the pandemic and statewide restrictions. Despite the postponement, Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan still encouraged people to visit the beach town this fall, according to a press release announcing the change to SunFest. “Ocean City has actively promoted the many ways visitors can enjoy the town while maintaining physical distancing this summer, but for an event like Sunfest, we recognized it would not be possible to host the event in a way that was in the best interest of public health,” Meehan said. The decision by the town came after state officials issued guidance stating SunFest couldn’t have any audiences for live performances because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has taken another step toward an expedited renovation project at a veterans’ care center that was the site of one of the nation’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks at a long-term care facility. The Office of Administration and Finance said it had selected a company to conduct a 12-week assessment of what needs to be done at the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke. The assessment includes meetings with stakeholders such as veterans and their families, staff, community members and state legislators. It will also look at cost estimates, financing options and realistic timelines for regulatory approvals, design and construction. The assessment by Payette will be used to develop and implement a plan to apply for a federal Veterans’ Affairs State Home Construction Grant by the April 15 deadline. “Our administration is committed to supporting important facility improvements for the Soldiers’ Home to ensure the facility can provide the best care possible for the veteran residents who have served our country with honor,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. During the outbreak at the 250-bed state-run facility that opened in 1952, 76 aging and sick residents died after contracting the disease caused by the coronavirus and dozens of other residents and staffers were sickened. A state investigation found that a building poorly designed for infection control, as well as “baffling” decisions by management, allowed the disease to run amok.The home’s superintendent was fired, and the state Veterans Services Director, who oversaw the home, resigned. The state has already spent $6 million to improve infection control at the facility, including the replacement of furnishings and the installation of air purification units.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Legislators gave final approval Monday to bills that would provide flexibility for K-12 schools as they prepare to open amid the coronavirus pandemic, waiving physical attendance and minimum instruction requirements to allow for remote classes. The legislation, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will sign, would give districts and charter schools the option to choose in-person instruction, online or a hybrid based on consulting with local health departments. Their student count, the foundation of state funding, would be weighted heavily toward last year’s figure and less so on uncertain enrollment in the new academic year. The plan utilizes innovative methods of instruction and keeps kids safe “without jeopardizing their education,” said House Education Committee Chairwoman Pamela Hornberger, a Republican from Macomb County’s Chesterfield Township. The measures were passed on 77-33, 77-29 and 81-25 bipartisan votes in the GOP-controlled House two days after clearing the Republican-led Senate following a deal with the Democratic governor. The bills would revise how attendance is linked to funding. Currently, districts must have 75% average daily attendance to get their full state aid. Instead, schools would have to make sure there are two-way interactions between 75% of students and their teachers. Districts also would have to administer a benchmark assessment to K-8 students twice, including once in the first nine weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:The City Council voted 5-1 to censure member Paul Brandmire for suggesting a mask mandate could lead to yellow star badges that mark COVID-19-positive people. At Monday’s meeting, council member Carol Lewis asked for the censure, stating she “never expected that a false equivalency of marking someone for death” would come up during during a discussion on mandating face masks to preserve life by preventing the spread of COVID-19. The council approved a mask mandate July 20, days before Gov. Tim Walz ordered masks worn in indoor spaces statewide. At the meeting, Brandmire said, “I mean, if we can mandate masks we can certainly mandate that any COVID-positive people wear some sort of identification badge, maybe like a bright yellow star or something on their lapel.” At the following meeting, on Aug. 3, Lewis and council member George Hontos asked Brandmire to apologize for his remarks. Brandmire refused to apologize for what he said was a “vague reference” against government overreach but said he would apologize to Holocaust survivors who were offended. Brandmire was unable to vote on the motion; he also did not respond to the motion or other council members’ comments Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is expanding access to free coronavirus testing for teachers and school-based emergency telehealth coverage after more than 70 of the state’s 82 counties have reported outbreaks during their first few weeks back in the classroom. The State Department of Health has reported 245 cases of coronavirus in teachers and 199 in students since some districts began returning to school in late July. More than 2,000 students and about 600 teachers at the start of this week are in quarantine after being exposed to the virus, state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. To curb the spread of the virus, Dobbs announced Monday that K-12 teachers in the state will now have access to free testing, regardless of whether they have symptoms or know they have been exposed. They will be able to be tested at the state’s two community testing sites, as well as 16 new regional mobile testing sites to be set up early next week. Additionally, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid said that it has expanded its coverage to allow schools without nurses or school-based clinics to access telehealth services. That change began Aug. 1 and will continue through the end of the pandemic, officials said. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said the two measures will ensure that Mississippi’s schools “will remain safe,” adding that he hopes expanding testing for teachers, in particular, will give educators confidence and “peace of mind” about returning to school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The mayor of Missouri’s largest city has been getting plenty of messages about people not following social distancing guidelines at bars, so he decided to check for himself. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told the Kansas City Star that he spent two hours on Saturday night dropping by or looking into eight businesses in the city. His decision to spot check came after a video circulated online showing more than 100 people – most without masks – at an event in the Power & Light District. The Democratic mayor publicized his personal cellphone number and he has received several messages about people ignoring guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. He decided to check out establishments in various neighborhoods of the city: Midtown-Westport, Country Club Plaza and the 18th and Vine Jazz District, where he lives. Lucas told the Star that most businesses were trying to follow public health guidance. He found “one bad actor,” another that did an “outstanding” job following protocols, and most somewhere in the middle. “There was one establishment I went to that appeared to be following absolutely no protections in the slightest,” said Lucas, who did not name the business.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Gov. Steve Bullock said his office has been in contact with actress Sharon Stone, shortly after she posted on social media about her sister, in which she said it took five days in Montana to get test results for a COVID-19 test. Bullock said Stone called the governor’s office last week but there was no indication of family members in hospitals and she offered to be part of a fundraiser to increase funding for testing. Bullock said in a news conference in which he was discussing Montana’s fire fund and budget that the state is working with health care providers to make sure they have the resources they need for testing and “we’re continuing to do the work to get rapid turnaround testing … 2-5 days … everywhere across the state.” Stone, 62, urged Instagram followers Sunday to wear a mask “for yourself and others” after her sister Kelly, who is immunocompromised, was hospitalized in Montana with COVID-19, USA TODAY reported. Stone posted photos of her sister Kelly’s hospital room and wrote that Kelly, who has lupus, had only visited the pharmacy but still contracted the virus. Stone said in a video that in Montana, where Kelly and her husband, Bruce Singer, live, people can’t get tested unless they are symptomatic. She said this was happening as people carried guns in a protest in front of a courthouse saying it was their right to not wear a mask. She said earlier that Bullock was not returning her calls and that the health department had hung up on her. She urges people to vote for Democratic president candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris because “with women in power we will fight for our families.” Bullock said the citizen advocate from the governor’s office called her Monday morning for more information. Bullock said there have been protesters in Helena and other places statewide about not only masks, but his stay-at-home order.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A western Nebraska school district has canceled most classes this week after three staff members tested positive for the coronavirus, requiring two dozen school workers to quarantine. Classes for most grade levels in the Broken Bow School District have been canceled for the week, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Superintendent Darren Tobey said in an online announcement that classes for prekindergarten and grades 6-12 were canceled through Friday. Kindergarten through fifth-grade classes were expected to be held as usual. The district is now also requiring all students and staff to wear masks through Sept. 7, including at extracurricular activities and on school transportation. The requirement will be revisited before it expires, Tobey said. The school district covers 426 square miles in Custer County and has an enrollment of more than 800 students.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Walmart in Mesquite and high-end retailer Nieman Marcus on the Las Vegas Strip were among 11 businesses statewide fined last week by inspectors for failure to comply with coronavirus pandemic mitigation measures, including mask-wearing and social distancing, officials said. A tire shop in Fernley was the only northern Nevada business that made the list following about 700 initial workplace visits statewide, a Nevada Occupational Safety and Health statement said. A Las Vegas pizza restaurant was fined about $6,000 and a Boulder City bar was ordered to pay more than $4,800, OSHA said. Other fines ranged from less than $3,000 for a tire store in Las Vegas to more than $12,600 for Walmart. Nieman Marcus was fined $8,501. The inspections followed Gov. Steve Sisolak’s announcement in July that he would focus more closely on data specific to businesses and municipalities rather than broad guidelines for geographic areas to reopen with measures in place to prevent COVID-19. The communities of Dayton and Mound House in Lyon County had the lowest municipal compliance rate, at 50%, OSHA said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The University of New Hampshire expects to open a coronavirus testing lab with a 12-hour turnaround time for results within a few weeks, the head of the state university system said Monday. Chancellor Todd Leach joined colleagues from private colleges and the community college system for a discussion hosted by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan. Students have begun returning to many campuses this week, and so far the process has gone smoothly, they said. At the public universities, students are required to get tested for the virus before arriving, and will be tested upon arrival and again within weeks, Leach said. The new lab will be able to process thousands of samples a day, not just from the UNH campus in Durham but from Plymouth State University and Keene State College, Leach said. “That will ensure no matter how busy things get around the country, we’ll have a turnaround time that’s fairly tight,” he said. At the state’s community colleges, where fewer students live in campus, the focus is less on testing and more on personal protective equipment, said interim Chancellor Susan Huard. That’s because many students also work as essential workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy gave a strong endorsement of having high school sports while saying such activities need to be limited to outdoors-only and with precautions. Murphy said the final determination on fall high school sports seasons will be made by the State Interscholastic Athletic Association, which he said “will only pursue a sports schedule if they feel the proper health and safety requirements can be met.” If districts opt not to have teams take the field, the state will not overrule them, he said. But Murphy said he was “hugely of the opinion we need sports,” citing beneficial mental and physical health, teamwork and camaraderie effects. If high school sports weren’t pursued, he said, third-party organizations would “fill that void” and might not provide the same level of oversight as would the high school athletic association. Murphy said most fall sports are outdoor activities and safer than indoor ones, and social distancing can be ensured among spectators and on sidelines. “There just isn’t evidence of outdoor flare-ups,” the governor said. “The flare-ups that we’ve seen at the college level, even at the community level, as far as we can tell have been overwhelmingly tied back to indoor activities that were away from the athletic activity.” The state’s high school athletic association said July 30 that “our return-to-play plan is in full swing throughout New Jersey,” adding “we’re eager to begin our seasons in mid-September.” NJ.com reported that the Newark school district, the state’s largest, announced plans Monday to begin the fall with all-remote instruction, reversing plans for some in-person instruction. Other school districts have announced similar plans and some have canceled high school sports for the fall.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces:With schools beginning classes through distance learning, districts have seen cases of staff with COVID-19 on their campuses – including Hatch Valley Public Schools, Gadsden Independent School District and Deming Public Schools. This has required schools to work closely with the New Mexico Department of Health to help track down those who have come in contact with people who have tested positive. Statewide, school districts are looking ahead and planning for students’ eventual return to campus for face-to-face learning. This has led districts to consider what actions they will take to limit the spread of the virus when it comes time for in-person learning. “It’s not a matter if we’ll have positive cases, it’s when we have positive cases — (and) to the extent we have them,” said Kelly Jameson, spokeswoman for Las Cruces Public Schools. “If there was a potential outbreak, it would be incumbent upon the district to be responsible and disclose any kind of threat to the public.” Like other districts, LCPS will be following guidance and taking advice from the DOH on procedures moving forward. Jameson said LCPS will be communicating any coronavirus activity to the community.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Indoor gyms in New York can reopen as soon as next week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday, if they meet public health requirements, including inspections, mandatory mask wearing, a 33% occupancy limit and 6 feet between gym-goers. All gyms that meet the state’s health and safety standards can open by Monday or as at late as Sept. 2 if local officials say they need more time for local inspections. County governments and the mayor of New York City can also decide to delay the start of indoor fitness classes beyond Sept. 2, Cuomo said. The governor’s announcement came just over five months after the state shuttered gyms and other businesses statewide in hopes of reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Gym and fitness studio owners have been clamoring for New York for their businesses to reopen as Cuomo has lifted restrictions on certain industries since mid-May. “The fitness industry is ready to reopen safely, with proper protocols in place to protect our employees and members,” Bill Lia, chairperson of the New York State Fitness Alliance, said recently. The Cuomo administration allowed bowling alleys to open with restrictions starting Monday, while indoor dining is allowed outside New York City.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Public schools returned to class Monday, with most students still learning from home through computers to start the year because of continued worries about COVID-19. Nearly every school in all K-12 districts began the new school year. Leaders of districts and charter schools that teach two-thirds of the 1.5 million public school students chose to implement full-remote learning for now, according to data from the Department of Public Instruction. The first day was marked by technical challenges beyond those that video conferencing and virtual learning bring. Districts reported trouble for children and instructors logging on to the North Carolina Education Cloud. The portal provides access to several digital applications, including tools for grading and attendance, instructional materials and lesson plans. “The product experienced a degradation in service this morning,” the Department of Public Instruction said in a news release. The service was working as of midday Monday, the agency said, and the vendor that provides the service will expain what went wrong. In a Facebook post, the Craven County Public Schools said the system experienced an “overload due to so many students across the state trying to login at the same time.” Under Gov. Roy Cooper’s plan, school boards could start the year by offering full remote learning, in-person instruction with strict social distancing or a mix.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Interim committee meetings for lawmakers have been canceled at least through next week after a member of the Legislature’s research arm tested positive for the coronavirus. John Bjornson, who heads the Legislative Council, said the staff member told him late Sunday night. Bjornson said he notified legislative leaders early Monday, who gave the OK to cancel the meetings as a precaution. Bjornson said the staff member is asymptomatic and was working from home on Monday. Five interim committee meetings had been scheduled for this week, and at least two next week. All will be rescheduled, Bjornson said. Bjornson, the Legislature’s top attorney, said he has encouraged all 32 of his staff to get tested for the coronavirus. The nonpartisan agency includes accountants and attorneys who help lawmakers with research, bill drafting and budget proposals. The staff member is not believed to have had close contact with any lawmaker over the past several days and came within reach of only a “handful” of fellow agency employees, Bjornson said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A state senator and two of her family members are recovering at home from COVID-19. “Both relatives are out of the hospital,” Sen. Tina Maharath, D-Canal Winchester, told The Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday morning. The 29-year-old workforce analyst tweeted Monday night that she had tested positive and two of her family members were hospitalized. She asked her followers to “wear your masks and stay at home if you’re sick” because her sister-in-law, who had been fighting cancer before she contracted the virus, didn’t survive. “I know she’s rooting for our recovery up in heaven right now,” Maharath tweeted. Maharath, whose parents immigrated to the United States as refugees from Laos, said her surviving family members were lucky to arrive at the hospital when they did. They need help translating what was being said, and a health-care worker just happened to know Lao and Hmong.If not for that man, Maharath said, her family would have been stuck dialing a language hotline and waiting until they found someone who could translate, “which can oftentimes take too long due to the lack of staffing for the southeast Asian languages.” The state senator isn’t the only elected official in Ohio to test positive. State Rep. Stephanie Howse, D-Cleveland, tested positive for COVID-19 in July.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said he has submitted an application for unemployed Oklahomans to receive an additional $300 in federal unemployment benefits. Once the Federal Emergency Management Agency approves the state’s grant application, the federal government will fund the $300-per-week benefit and Oklahoma will fulfill the 25% state match through existing unemployment benefits, Stitt said. For months, on top of their state benefit, unemployed Americans also collected $600 a week in federal jobless aid, but that expired at the end of July, and negotiations in Congress to extend it collapsed. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that would provide $300 a week to replace the expired $600. Unemployed Oklahomans have faced numerous challenges in receiving their unemployment benefits, with lines of people often stretching for blocks outside the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. The agency has blamed delays on an outdated computer system, and Interim OESC Director Shelley Zumwalt acknowledged some delays in the new benefit should be expected.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The state’s jobs recovery slowed in July despite the unemployment rate dropping to 10.4% from 11.6% in June. The state gained back 20,500 jobs in the month after adding 57,000 jobs in June, and the state has gained back 38% of the jobs cut in March and April because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Well, although the past couple months we’ve seen historic monthly job gains, employers have only added back about two of the five jobs that were cut in March and April,” said Anna Johnson, senior economic analyst for the Oregon Employment Department. The largest monthly job gains in July were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which recovered 7,300 jobs; the government added 5,700, retail gained 3,600 and health care added 3,100. Nationally, the unemployment rate declined to 10.2% in July from 11.1% in June.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration is trying to make it clear that masks are to be worn practically at all times by students in school, drawing complaints that school leaders must again change their preparations. The administration this week released additional guidance that Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Tuesday clarifies the state’s intentions for mask-wearing in schools as they prepare to reopen in the coming days and weeks. Masks must be worn in school, even when students and educators are 6 feet apart, Levine said. “We have had questions about it and we’ve had enough questions that we wanted to clarify,” Levine said at a news conference. “That we mean that when the young people are wearing masks, that they are wearing masks that they are in their classroom even though they’re six feet apart, they should be wearing their masks.” But with some private or career technical schools already open, school officials said it is another frustrating change in guidance. They said they had previously been told that students and educators could remove their masks in the classrooms if they were at least 6 feet apart. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that universal face covering is ideal in schools, but not always possible in the school setting for many reasons. DiRocco said it’s going to be a much more difficult task to ensure that students have a mask on their face throughout the day in a classroom setting, particularly in younger children through third grade.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: There were 75 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Rhode Island on Monday and one additional death, the state Department of Health reported Tuesday. The department also reported 78 people in the hospital with the disease as of Sunday, the latest day for which the information was available, a slight decline from the previous day. Eight patients were in intensive care. The state has now had nearly 20,700 confirmed cases of the disease and 1,024 fatalities. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island went from 104.43 per day on Aug. 3 to 91.14 per day on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Rhode Island declined from 2.56% on Aug. 3 to 2.36% on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins statistics.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville:South Carolina has the nation’s third-highest rate of COVID-19 infections in children, trailing only Arizona and Tennessee, according to a medical report issued this week. The report from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that 15,295 children in South Carolina have contracted COVID-19 since the pandemic began. That figure accounts for slightly more than 1% of the state’s age 20-and-under population. About 15% of the state’s overall COVID-19 cases are in children. South Carolina is the nation’s 23rd-most populated state but ranks eighth in its number of COVID-19 infections in children. Two children under age 5 have died of COVID-19 in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. One was from Greenville County. More than 75,000 new cases of COVID-19 in children were reported across the nation between July 30 and Aug. 13 – a 24% increase from the previous two-week period, according to the AAP report. Children infected with COVID-19 are less likely to develop serious illnesses than adults who have the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the most recent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the CDC noted, “hospitalization rates in children are increasing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: This year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally drew more than 460,000 vehicles during the 10-day event, according to a count that South Dakota transportation officials released Tuesday. The count represents a decrease of nearly 8% from last year but showed that many were undeterred by the coronavirus pandemic. Sturgis officials said they expected fewer people to show up this year, estimating they would see between 250,000 and 300,000 people during the 10-day event. Most people didn’t take significant precautions against COVID-19 infections at this year’s rally. A few people wore masks and some said they were avoiding crowds, but many others packed close together at bars and concerts. With people traveling to the rally from all over the country, the mass gathering has raised concerns it could become an epicenter of infections that are hard to track, but spread quickly as rally-goers travel home. The city releases an estimate of rally turnout after the event every year, based mostly on the weight of the trash generated. Last year, the estimate tracked closely with the number of vehicles counted: 499,654 vehicles entered Sturgis, and city officials estimated 490,000 people came to the rally. The city plans to conduct mass COVID-19 testing in an effort to catch outbreaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has signed into law sweeping protections for businesses, schools and nursing homes against coronavirus lawsuits. Lee touted the legislation as “historic” and argued the law would protect businesses from “frivolous lawsuits.” The GOP-dominated Statehouse could not advance the proposal earlier this year when negotiations among lawmakers broke down in the hectic waning hours of legislative work. Lee convened a special legislative session to not only address COVID-19 liability, but also telemedicine and penalties against protesters who violate certain laws. Under Lee’s leadership, Tennessee was one of the first states to begin reopening in late April after the Republican reluctantly issued a safer-at-home order that forced businesses to close. Lee has since maintained he will not shut down the economy and has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas surpassed 10,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths Monday as the lingering toll of a massive summer outbreak continues, and health experts expressed concerns that recent encouraging trends could be fragile as schools begin reopening for 5 million students across the state. Roughly four in every five of those deaths were reported after June 1. Texas embarked on one of the fastest reopenings in the country in May before an ensuing surge in cases led Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to backtrack and impose a statewide mask order. August has seen an improving outlook, although Texas officials are now concerned that not enough people are seeking tests. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 51 new deaths Monday, along with more than 2,700 new cases, Numbers are typically lower on Monday because reporting lags over weekends. Texas joins New York, New Jersey and California as the other states to surpass 10,000 coronavirus deaths. Florida is also approaching the grim milestone. Abbott is now urging Texans not to grow complacent as the numbers improve and schools and universities reopen.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah lawmaker said some teachers in the state haven’t received any personal protective equipment as students start returning to schools. Democratic Sen. Kathleen Riebe, who is also a teacher, said her classroom hasn’t received any of the necessary equipment during an education subcommittee hearing Monday, Fox 13 reported. Riebe, who represents Cottonwood Heights, said teachers in her district were “nervous” about the lack of supplies. “I have not seen any of this equipment in our schools, and I’m receiving many emails and phone calls and social media displays that these things have not made it to our schools,” said Riebe, whose school district will reopen Monday. Sarah Young, the state Board of Education’s director of strategic initiatives, said the necessary PPE is in stock and that teachers in Riebe’s district will receive it this week. Education officials said they have purchased extra face coverings and other equipment, but an order for nearly 200,000 packages of disinfectant wipes likely won’t be delivered to the state until Sept. 15. Each teacher is supposed to receive five packages of the wipes.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: As schools prepare to restart in September, Vermont plans to expand child care capacity, including opening regional hubs to serve school-aged children on remote learning days at their schools, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said. Scott said he would also modify state regulations to allow registered home-based child care centers to serve longer hours on school days, which he believes will add about 3,000 spots. “We know we need more childcare capacity and we need it quickly,” Scott said, noting that child care will be a challenge for many parents as schools move back and forth from in-person and remote learning. The regional child care hubs will be set up in workplaces, as well as school, recreational, municipal and summer camp buildings, Agency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said. The state anticipates needing 73 such hubs that could serve as many as 7,000 school-aged children, he said. The state also will expedite administrative processing and increase flexibility for applicants seeking to become registered child care providers, Smith said. The Scott administration is recommending that $12 million in federal coronavirus relief funding be used on the child care initiative, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers met Tuesday for a special session to address the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread calls for criminal justice reform sparked by the death of George Floyd. Gov. Ralph Northam also announced budget proposals aimed at increasing voter access, including $2 million for prepaid postage for all absentee ballots and budget language that expressly permits local governments to use drop boxes or implement drop-off locations for absentee voters. Before the session, two groups of protesters gathered on the sidewalk outside of the Science Museum of Virginia, where the state Senate was meeting inside. Lawmakers in the House met at Virginia Commonwealth University’s basketball arena, with desks spread far out. Many male lawmakers skipped wearing ties, which Northam – a pediatric neurologist – has said can help spread disease. Most lawmakers wore masks, but not all of them. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported one group of protesters, organized by the Virginia New Majority, gathered outside the museum to lobby for rent relief and to call for an end to evictions, chanting “eviction is violence.”\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:Under state COVID-19 guidelines, bowling alleys are listed as reopening in Phase 4, two beyond Kitsap’s current Phase 2. There’s increasing worry that Kitsap might not get there until at least 2021, leaving the family that owns Kitsap’s last two bowling alleys – All Star Lanes & Casino in Silverdale and the Hi Joy Bowl in Port Orchard – in limbo. “This is the only time we’ve ever asked, ‘Are we gonna make it,’ “ said Kylie Myers-Hicks, All Star’s operations manager. “It’s scary for sure.” These are bowling’s slow months; business picks up in the winter. Getting through late 2020 and early 2021 could make the difference, she said. The alleys, like other indoor recreation businesses, face a precarious future under the restrictions of the pandemic. Far removed from their midcentury heyday, when even Kitsap had at least a half-dozen bowling alleys, the sport now faces possible obsolescence. Earlier this month, Glacier Lanes in Everett closed its doors after 60 years in business. Hi Joy and All Star, owned by the Myers family since 1970 and 1985, respectively, have been closed since March 16. While restaurants and bars at both have been able to reopen, the lanes – 40 at All Star and 32 at Hi Joy – remain empty. The bowling alley’s management received money from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, but that money will run out by October. At that point, things are uncertain for the employer of more than 200 people. “There’s just a point where the savings runs out and there’s nothing to fall back on,” Myers-Hicks said. Myers-Hicks would like to see rules established for earlier openings of bowling alleys like those her family operates. Already, the business has created a socially distanced environment and ramped up disinfection. There is one bowling alley that remains open, albeit on a limited basis, and it’s just for sailors and their families. The Olympic Bowling Center at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor is open Friday and Saturday nights. Base officials inspect the center before opening, and bowling is restricted to every other lane. Only families can bowl together, according to Jake Chappelle, a Naval Base Kitsap spokesman.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials have decided to cancel elk tours this year because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Logan State Park naturalist Lauren Cole, who leads the tours, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that there would be too many risks involved if the tours were allowed. “The problem is that we have to put 12 guests and two employees in a 15-passenger van to get to the (Tomblin) Wildlife Management Area property where the elk are. There’s no way to social-distance in a van,” she said. Division of Natural Resources officials have allowed up to 24 public tours each year since 2018, and they are usually timed between early September and mid-October to coincide with mating season. The tours quickly became very popular, and Cole said she expects resume leading them fall as long as there’s no concern about the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Interim University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson said he will ask Gov. Tony Evers to include a nearly $100 million boost for the system in the next state budget and give him permission to borrow up to $1 billion as the coronavirus pandemic bleeds revenue from campuses. A UW news release outlining the request makes no mention of the virus. The closest it comes is a sentence with Thompson acknowledging “unprecedented challenges.” Instead, the release lists a number of new initiatives Thompson wants to use the money to launch. Chief among them is the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a pledge to pay up to four years’ worth of tuition and fees at any regional campus for incoming state resident freshmen and transfer students whose families make $60,000 or less. The initiative is modeled after UW-Madison’s Bucky’s Tuition Promise, which covers tuition for resident freshmen and transfer students at the state’s flagship university. The money also would go toward expanding and enhancing online courses, forgiving teachers’ student loans, providing stipends for student teachers, adding 20 county-based agriculture positions in the Division of Extension at UW-Madison, and expanding student mental health services. Thompson also plans to ask Evers to include permission in the budget to borrow between $500 million and $1 billion in the current fiscal year to cushion pandemic-related losses, according to a budget summary prepared for regents.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 45 on Monday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 40 and the number of probable cases rising by five, the Casper Star-Tribune reported, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update. Patients have tested positive for coronavirus in all 23 of Wyoming’s counties. Wyoming has the second-lowest recorded number of coronavirus deaths of any state with 33, behind Hawaii, and its death rate of 5 per 100,000 residents is third-lowest behind Hawaii and Alaska, according to the New York Times.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/04/25/trump-100-days-changes-in-america/83042626007/", "title": "Trump's first 100 days: Here's 100 things that have changed (so far)", "text": "Updated April 25, 2025, 5:20 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON - From the structure of the global economy to the use of plastic straws, Donald Trump's second term has already overseen a whirlwind of change.\n\nNot since Franklin Roosevelt has a new president driven so many shifts, so fast. Actually, Trump may have FDR beat on the signature first-100-days marker, even though his predecessor was inaugurated with a Great Depression to tackle.\n\nIt takes most presidents months or even years to make a difference in the daily lives of Americans, not to mention those who live around the world. But this time, Trump's unprecedented use of executive powers has already slashed the federal workforce, banned diversity programs, dismantled USAID, divided opposition Democrats over how to respond and prompted longstanding U.S. allies to calculate how to navigate a new global reality.\n\nHe even seems to have had an effect on the most popular baby names.\n\nHere's a look at 100 things that have changed during Trump's first 100 days − the momentous and the less so.\n\n1 - The Dow Jones industrial average has been on a rollercoaster. It plunged with the announcement of tariffs, spiked with news of a 90-day delay, and rose and fell with headlines of an escalating global trade war. The markets faced their worst slide since the coronavirus pandemic and the bond market went into an historic panic.\n\n2 - The number of migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border plummeted since the end of the Biden administration to about 8,450 in February 2025, Trump’s first full month in office, the lowest level in at least 25 years. In December 2024, President Joe Biden’s last full month in office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement had reported 47,000 apprehensions, more than five times more.\n\n3 - Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who gained prominence as a vaccine skeptic, took over the federal health agenda. He banned some artificial food dyes and promised a report by September explaining the rise in autism cases.\n\n4 - The number of deportations by ICE dropped a bit despite Trump administration efforts to step up the pace. More than 12,000 were deported in February 2024, during Biden’s administration, to about 11,000 in February 2025, during Trump's administration.\n\n5 - Eggs are more expensive. The average cost of a dozen large eggs, which became a symbol of inflation during the 2024 presidential campaign, continued to rise amid a bird-flu crisis, to $6.23 in March, though wholesale prices had begun to drop.\n\n6 - Relations with Canada soured as Trump imposed tariffs and suggested making it the 51st state. The debate over the U.S. president became a major factor in Canada's elections on April 28.\n\n7 - The Gulf of Mexico was renamed the Gulf of America – at least in official federal government publications.\n\n8 - DEI programs, designed to address the nation's history of racism, were scrapped across federal government agencies and the military. The Trump administration also targeted the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs at private law firms, public universities and other institutions that receive federal funding or rely on federal approvals. T\n\n9 - Republican victories leave Republicans nervous. Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis were sworn in as new Republican U.S. House members, holding on to GOP seats in special elections in Florida – but by margins slashed in half since last November’s election that Democrats chalked up to Trump's early controversies as president.\n\n10 - Evidence of that nervousness: Trump backed away from elevating the star of the GOP's attack on college antisemitism because he was worried Republicans couldn't hold on to her House seat. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was nominated as UN ambassador on Jan. 20 and then un-nominated in March.\n\n11 - The Black Lives Matter Plaza, a two-block stretch in downtown Washington, D.C., pointed to the White House, was dismantled and repainted, a capitulation by the city government to Trump. It was created as an emblem of defiance to him during his first term amid protests over the death of George Floyd.\n\n12 - Susan Crawford won a swing seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, with potential repercussions on everything from abortion rights to legislative redistricting in the battleground state. Billionaire Elon Musk spent $25 million on behalf of her opponent, making it the nation's most expensive judicial race ever. It was a boost for Democrats after November's losses.\n\n13 - The White House overhauled the press pool, the small group of journalists that tracks the president in small spaces and during travel. First the Associated Press, then Reuters and Bloomberg lost their permanent standing in the pool. \"New media\" outlets, including some with MAGA sentiments, were added to the rotation.\n\n14 - Chinese imports −from toys and clothes to furniture and sports equipment − were slapped with an escalating series of tariffs that reached 145%.

He trailed every other post-World War II president at this point in their terms by double digits.\n\n19 - Views of the Democratic Party sank to record lows, with a favorability rating of 27% in an NBC poll.\n\n20 - In the same survey, 39% of registered voters had a favorable view of the Republican Party.\n\n21 - New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker won props for stamina with a no-bathroom-breaks speech on the Senate floor that stretched past 25 hours, beating the record set by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond. Booker was blasting Trump’s policies; Thurmond had been filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\n22 - Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired. Tens of thousands more took buyout offers.\n\n23 - Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, designed and led the Department of Governmental Efficiency, which cut a swath through federal agencies.

Auto tariffs played a role, too. Musk said he would be spending more time at Tesla, less time with DOGE.\n\n26 - Birthright citizenship, guaranteed in the Constitution's 14th Amendment, was ordered ended by executive order. The issue is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n27 - Hundreds of alleged members of the violent Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs were deported to El Salvador’s notorious maximum-security prison.\n\n28 - The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint in the debate over whether the administration's immigration crackdown needed to follow due process rules. He was deported from Maryland to the Salvadoran prison in what U.S. officials acknowledged was an administrative error. The Supreme Court told the administration to facilitate his return. The issue remains in the courts.\n\n29 - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivered an invitation from King Charles III to Trump for an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom. The president accepted on the spot.\n\n30 - Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance went to Greenland to test the waters on Trump’s proposal to take it over. The waters were, well, icy.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ovi's longtime friend, was among those congratulating the Russian player.\n\n32 - Trump is no longer a federal defendant. Indictments on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election and of mishandling sensitive documents were dismissed at the request of his administration’s Justice Department. Special counsel Jack Smith said in his final report that there was enough evidence to convict Trump.\n\n33 - The U.S. House of Representatives agreed to allow members who were new parents to use \"vote pairing\" to ease the burden of traveling to Washington with newborns. Speaker Mike Johnson had opposed a bipartisan proposal to allow them to vote remotely.\n\n34 - Attorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The Biden administration had imposed a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study how executions were conducted.\n\n35 - Columbia agreed to dramatic concessions after the Trump administration threatened to cancel $400 million in federal funding amid complaints about antisemitism. The university said it would tighten rules on protests and appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the Middle Eastern studies department.\n\n36 - Harvard refused Trump's demands. The administration said it would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding, and the president said the school should lose its tax-exempt status. Harvard then sued the Trump administration, accusing it of threatening the school's academic independence.\n\n37 - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP was the first of several elite law firms to cut a deal to avoid threatened penalties from Trump. In all, the firms have agreed to provide about $1 billion worth of free legal work for projects the firm and Trump support.\n\n38 - Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, refused Trump's demands, as did Jenner & Block and WilmerHale. Their lawsuits are in the courts.\n\n39 - Environmental regulations on coal production were loosened, part of Trump's priority to increase U.S. energy production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" was a signature promise at his campaign rallies.\n\n40 - Logging was allowed on more than half of national forests, and federal lands in Nevada and New Mexico were opened to the mining of rare minerals, reversing prohibitions Biden put in place during the final weeks of his administration.\n\n41 - A vast Pacific Ocean reserve, 750 miles west of Hawaii, was opened to commercial fishing.

During an Oval Office meeting to discuss Great Lakes protection and other state issues, Trump called Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan \"a very good person.\" He had previously referred to her as \"that woman from Michigan.\"\n\n69 - Democratic governors stepped up confrontations with Trump, including several who are considering 2028 president bids. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2024, called on party leaders to \"do something, dammit!\" Even Whitmer looked less than enthusiastic about being embraced in the Oval Office, at one point holding file folders up to hide her face from news photographers.\n\n70 - Trump showed reporters the mock-up for a laminated \"gold card,\" a special visa that would allow immigrants to buy legal status in the U.S. for $5 million each. The card showed Trump's face, the Statue of Liberty, a bald eagle and the words \"The Trump Card.\"\n\n71 - Presidential golf is back. Trump spent at least 24 days on the golf course between Inauguration Day and April 19. Trump played three rounds of golf the weekend after announcing big reciprocal tariffs on a host of nations, claiming a club championship as financial markets plummeted. Then-President Joe Biden golfed once during his first 100 days in office.\n\n72 - The Saudi-backed LIV Golf league held its first domestic event of the year at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami. The president dined with LIV golfers, and his family members attended the tournament. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, is keen to influence U.S. foreign policy in the region. Trump is keen to host professional golfers at his clubs, having been snubbed by the PGA Tour in the past.\n\n73 - Palm Beach again ranks among world capitals as a major power center.

Trump signed an executive order in the White House surrounded by little girls in sports jerseys.\n\n75 - Smoot-Hawley is a thing again. The 1930 tariff act, which is name-checked in a famous scene from the 1986 movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", is being mentioned as part of the political debate around Trump's tariffs. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul is warning that Smoot-Hawley, blamed for worsening the Great Depression, led to a GOP political massacre that kept the party out of power for six decades.\n\n76 - Crypto is king! Trump signed an executive order to promote cryptocurrencies, staging an event with crypto leaders in the White House. The president even has his own crypto business.

It has since sunk in value, but still has a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.\n\n79 - Trump's face could be on Mount Rushmore and a proposed new $250 bill. Both of those ideas were proposed by GOP lawmakers in legislation filed in the House this year.\n\n80 -Fort Bragg, which had been renamed Fort Liberty during the Biden administration, was re-renamed Fort Bragg.

He was barred by law from naming it for someone who had served in the Confederacy.\n\n81 - Move NASA to Ohio? HUD to Houston? State and local officials had until April 14 to vie to relocate federal agencies away from Washington and across the country. Decisions are pending.\n\n82 - The federal government is consolidating massive personal records about individual Americans which had been held separately at the Social Security administration, the Treasury Department and elsewhere. Trump signed an executive order to take the step, proposed by Musk and DOGE, despite concerns about privacy and security.\n\n83 - Trump fired the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and named himself as chairman. The new leadership announced the exterior lighting of the building would permanently feature red, white and blue. The Broadway hit \"Hamilton\" canceled its upcoming performance. \"I never liked 'Hamilton' very much,\" the president said.\n\n84 - States were told they could no longer use Medicaid funding to pay for gender-affirming care for minors.\n\n85 - The U.S. Naval Academy's library was purged of books that officials said violated the Trump administration's ban on DEI, among them \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou. Left on the shelves was \"Mein Kampf\" by Adolf Hitler.\n\n86 - Paper straws? Out. Plastic straws? Back. Biden last year had ordered the federal government to phase out the purchase of single-use plastics, such as straws, by 2035. Within weeks of his inauguration, Trump ordered the federal government to stop buying paper straws.\n\n87 - Federal prosecutions for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act are on hold. Trump signed an executive order arguing that bribery prosecutions hurt U.S. companies trying to compete overseas. Among those convicted was Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chair in 2016. Trump pardoned him in the final days of his first term.\n\n88 - Funding for the Voice of America was slashed. Trump accused it of being a voice of \"radical propaganda.\" His attempt to fire its workers is in the courts.\n\n89 - TikTok has avoided the chopping block − that is, the congressionally mandated deadline for the popular app to be separated from its Chinese owner or be banned in the USA. Trump is trying to strike a deal, though that effort has become entangled in the trade war.\n\n90 - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ceased operations in February on order from its acting director, Russell Vought. The bureau, a top cause of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was created in the wake of the Great Recession to help fight financial fraud. Now it's one of the federal agencies being dismantled by DOGE, but a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to halt efforts to shutter the CFPB.\n\n91 - Governing by tweet is back. Except now it's governing by Truth, as Trump takes to his social media platform, Truth Social, to announce all manner of administration actions. His big 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs? Announced first on Truth Social.\n\n92 - The presidential press conference is reborn. Trump took questions from the media while signing executive orders on his first day back in office. He hasn't stopped talking since. Trump's media availabilities have been constant, and are coming in all forms, including during Oval Office events, while meeting with world leaders, on Air Force One and in actual press conferences. It's a big contrast with Biden, who was tightly scripted and had limited media availability.\n\n93 - American diplomacy looks a lot different. Just ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump berated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and later told him to leave the White House, a shocking moment in the annals of U.S. foreign relations.\n\n94 - Bilateral negotiations between Ukraine and Russia may loom. The conflict wasn't settled in a day, as Trump had promised during the campaign, but the administration has pushed for progress or threatened to \"move on.\"\n\n95 - Dozens of court cases have been filed to block administration actions at least temporarily, according to a Lawfare tracker. That is a record use of the court system as a recourse by states, unions, activist groups and individuals.\n\n96 - Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders became the most prominent politician ever to speak onstage at Coachella and, at 83, probably the oldest. He and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez drew big crowds across the country with their \"fighting oligarchy\" tour.\n\n97 - Former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden spoke out against Trump, at odds with a general tradition. Biden, who had largely disappeared from public view after Trump's inauguration, delivered a speech in Chicago on April 15, accusing his successor of \"taking a hatchet\" to the Social Security administration.\n\n98 - For 132 years, presidents who won two terms served them back-to-back. With Trump's inauguration, he dislodged Grover Cleveland's solo standing as the only president to win a term, lose an election, then win another term. \"It's kind of weird, and it's kind of fun,\" said Cleveland's grandson, George Cleveland, of Tamworth, N.H.\n\n99 − An addition to the White House grounds: 100-foot flag poles to display the American flag that Trump announced he would have installed on the North Lawn and the South Lawn.\n\n100 - Trump suggested he might run for a third term, despite the Constitution's 14th Amendment barring it. His company is selling \"Trump 2028\" hats for $50. He has encouraged the speculation and declined to endorse Vice President JD Vance as his successor. But does he mean it?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/17/live-politics-updates-joe-biden-inauguration-donald-trump-impeachment/4196264001/", "title": "Politics updates: Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's account", "text": "Updated Jan. 17, 2021, 5:37 p.m. ET\n\nTwitter temporarily suspends account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nTwitter announced Sunday it had suspended the account of freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for 12 hours.\n\nThe Republican’s last post to the site was a video in which she continued to allege debunked and unfounded conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud in her home state of Georgia. Twitter flagged the post with a warning and blocked users from liking or commenting on the post.\n\nIn another post earlier in the day, Greene attacked Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voter system implementation manager, spreading a false claim about alleged corruption from Dominion voting machines.\n\n\"Morons like you are responsible for losing GA’s 2 Republican Senate seats,\" Greene said. The post was again flagged by Twitter for spreading misinformation.\n\n\"Moments ago, I was 'temporarily' banned from Twitter right after I railed against Georgia Election Officials for a rigged election and announced my Articles of Impeachment against Joe Biden,\" Greene said in a fundraising email sent out Sunday evening that referred to unfounded allegations of corruption against the incoming Democratic president.\n\n\"I’m not going back to the days of Republicans bending over backwards to appease the Democrats and the Fake News Media,\" she wrote\n\nGreene is a firebrand conspiracy theorist who has claimed the United States is experiencing an \"Islamic invasion into our government offices,\" that the Pentagon was not actually attacked on 9/11, that Black people are \"slaves to the Democratic Party\" and that billionaire Jewish philanthropist George Soros is a Nazi.\n\nAnd she has expressed support for the baseless and wide-ranging QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\n\"Q is a patriot. We know that for sure,\" Greene has said.\n\nTwitter’s temporary suspension of Greene comes after it suspended 70,000 Twitter accounts connected to the QAnon believers, as well as prominent rightwing pundits and President Donald Trump.\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper was not optimistic that Twitter's brief suspension would change Greene's ways.\n\n\"I’m sure the woman who claimed a plane never really flew into the Pentagon on 9/11, an anti-Muslim bigot who has been nonetheless welcomed by @GOPLeader and @SteveScalise into the GOP caucus, will totally be chastised by this 12 hour suspension, examining her life choices,\" Tapper tweeted with sarcasm.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nGOP Sen. Ben Sasse denounces QAnon, conspiracy theories on the right\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., condemned the popularity of conspiracy theories within the Republican Party and the broader conservative movement in a blistering op-ed for The Atlantic, telling his party it must \"reject conspiracy theories or be consumed by them.\"\n\nSasse’s opinion piece comes after a mob ransacked the U.S. Capitol. President Donald Trump had called on the crowd of his supporters to \"march down Pennsylvania Avenue\" and \"show strength\" as Congress voted to certify the Nov. 3 presidential election.\n\nSasse admonished his fellow Republicans, stating that many had deluded themselves about the threat conspiracy theories posed to the party. Sasse said prominent newly-elected conspiracy theorists like freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom he called \"cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.\"\n\n\"Until last week, many party leaders and consultants thought they could preach the Constitution while winking at QAnon. They can’t,\" Sasse wrote. \"Now is the time to decide what this party is about.\"\n\nSasse argues that the rise of right-wing conspiracy theories in the Trump era has occurred for three reasons: the ostensibly poor media diet of Americans, a collapse of trust and engagement with civic institutions, and a loss of national meaning.\n\n\"A conspiracy theory offers its devotees a way of inserting themselves into a cosmic battle pitting good against evil. This sense of vocation that makes it dangerous is also precisely what makes it attractive in our era of isolated, alienated consumerism,” Sasse writes.\n\nThe junior Nebraska senator argued that to win again, Republicans must \"repudiate the nonsense that has set our party on fire\" and then \"offer a genuine answer to the frustrations of the past decade.\"\n\nReferencing a viral confrontation between Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman and a QAnon adherent storming the Capitol, Sasse wrote. \"In a standoff between the Constitution and madness, both men picked a side. It’s the GOP’s turn to do the same.\"\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nBiden aides: Threats won't stop Joe Biden from taking the oath of office and getting to work\n\nAides to President-elect Joe Biden said Sunday they are aware of threats nationwide surrounding this week's inauguration, but they won't stop his plans to take the oath of office and get to work.\n\nIncoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, speaking on CNN, said he has confidence that the Secret Service, National Guard, and others can protect Washington, D.C., but \"we are concerned, certainly, about these threats in other places.\"\n\n\"We will have a team in place in the White House to monitor these actions going forward starting on 12:00 noon on Jan. 20,\" Klain said during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nLess than two weeks after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol, officials in Washington are bracing for the inauguration with street closings, high fences and concrete barriers, and thousands of armed police officers and National Guard troops.\n\nKate Bedingfield, the incoming White House communications director, told ABC News' \"This Week\" that \"you only have to look at the chatter on social media to see that we are in a volatile time, and so we are making preparations.\"\n\nThat said, she added, it is \"our plan and our expectation\" to have Biden take the oath of office outside on the west front of the Capitol.\n\nAfter that, aides said, Biden has an agenda of items to move forward on. They ranged from having the United State rejoin the Paris climate change accord to new plans to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We're inheriting a huge mess here,\" Klain said, referring in particular to problems with distributing COVID vaccines. \"But we have a plan to fix it.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump aide: Members of impeachment legal team (including Giuliani) yet to be determined\n\nWhile Rudy Giuliani was at the White House on Saturday, an adviser to outgoing President Donald Trump said he has not selected members for his impeachment defense team.\n\nTrump \"has not yet made a determination as to which lawyer or law firm will represent him for the disgraceful attack on our Constitution and democracy, known as the 'impeachment hoax,'\" spokesman Hogan Gidley tweeted Sunday. \"We will keep you informed.\"\n\nThe House impeached Trump last week on charges of inciting the insurrection and attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The Senate is scheduled to try Trump later this year, even though he will be out of office.\n\nGiuliani told ABC News he is working on Trump's defense, though Gidley's statement indicates that is not official – at least not yet.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump approval ratings hold steady after Capitol riot, second impeachment\n\nPresident Donald Trump will be leaving office with a record low, yet historically stable approval rating, according to recent polls.\n\nAn NBC News poll found that Trump’s approval rating with voters nationwide stood at 43%, slightly down from the 45% the poll registered before the November election. A similar Washington Post/ABC News poll found Trump held a 38% approval rating, down seven points from when that poll was conducted in October.\n\nThe findings come after Trump became the first president in American history to be impeached twice by Congress, a week after he told a large crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol ahead of a deadly riot in which the mob stormed the building.\n\nThe recent polls underscore Trump’s tenure as one of the most polarizing figures in American history.\n\nWhile only 5% of Democrats approved of Trump in the NBC News poll, 87% of Republicans gave the president a positive approval rating. Those numbers show only marginal declines from late October, when Trump had a 6% and 89% approval rating among Democrats and Republicans, respectively. In both reports, independents gave the president a 44% approval rating.\n\nForty-nine percent of respondents said Trump was \"one of the worst\" presidents, and an additional 9% said he was \"not as good as most,\" in the NBC News poll. Nineteen percent of respondents, however, believed Trump was \"one of the best,\" and another 21% said he was \"better than most.\"\n\nA new USA TODAY/ Suffolk University poll found Americans are worried about the health of the nation’s democracy. Seventy percent of respondents in that poll said American democracy was weaker than it was four years ago. Another 70% called the Capitol rioters \"criminals,\" though one in four felt the rioters \"went too far, but they had a point.\"\n\nA recent CBS News poll found that 54% of Americans believed that the biggest threat to the American way of life was \"other people in America,\" highlighting high levels of distrust within the nation.\n\nDivisions over Trump’s conduct and the legitimacy of the presidential election are also evident in the polls.\n\nSixty-six percent of respondents in the Post/ABC poll said Trump acted irresponsibly in the aftermath of the November election. Sixty-two percent believed that Joe Biden won the presidential election legitimately and that there was no solid evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election.\n\nThe Post/ABC poll also found persistent divides over not only the 2020 election, but also Trump’s win in 2016. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said Trump’s 2016 victory was legitimate versus 42% who said it was not.\n\nIt is likely these divides will persist. While 69% of voters overall would like to see the Republican Party chart a new path after Trump, 57% of Republican-leaning voters want Republican leaders to follow Trump’s lead, the Post/ABC poll found.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nLindsey Graham to Trump: Don't pardon insurrectionists\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham once criticized President Donald Trump over his demands to overturn his election loss to Joe Biden, but Graham was full of support in an interview broadcast Sunday – though he did warn Trump not to pardon extremist supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\"To seek a pardon of these people would be wrong ... I think it would destroy President Trump,\" Graham said on the Fox News program \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"And I hope we don't go down that road.\"\n\nGraham also praised Trump's accomplishments in office and reaffirmed the president's place as the leader of the GOP.\n\n\"Mr. President, your policies will stand the test of time,\" he said on the Fox program that Trump is known to watch. \"You're the most important figure in the Republican Party. You can shape the direction of the party, keep your movement alive.\"\n\nDemonstrating his fealty to Trump, Graham later released a letter to incoming Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., requesting a dismissal of the impeachment case charging him with inciting the Capitol riot. Holding a Senate trial, he said, would delay \"the healing of this great Nation.\"\n\nSchumer is not expected to grant the request, and several political analysts mocked Graham's call for unity.\n\n\"You don't get to whine about 'healing' now after you personally inflicted so many of the wounds,\" tweeted historian Kevin Kruse.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHouse prosecutor: We're developing a trial plan to detail Donald Trump egged on capital rioters\n\nWASHINGTON – The top House impeachment prosecutor said Sunday his team is developing a \"trial plan\" designed to detail President Donald Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told CNN the plan would be used during Trump's Senate trial later this year. Raskin said he did not know exactly when the trial might take place, but noted that a conviction would bar Trump from holding future office and end any of his remaining presidential aspirations.\n\n\"This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America,\" Raskin said on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThe House impeached Trump on charges of inciting an insurrection designed to intimidate lawmakers into reversing his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment of Trump as a result of the riot that left five people dead.\n\nRaskin said Trump inspired the insurrection with his constant lies about widespread election fraud after Biden's win, from a series of lawsuits to his fiery speech at a rally right before the invasion of the Capitol building.\n\nHouse leaders have not delivered the impeachment article to the Senate, which is responsible for trying Trump even though he is out of office. Democrats will take political control of the Senate later this week.\n\nRaskin is leading the House prosecution team in the wake of his son's self-inflicted death.\n\nThe Maryland congressman told CNN he is inspired by the memory of his late son, as well as colleagues, aides, and workers who were threatened by the mob at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I'm not going to lose my son at the end of 2020, and lose my country and my republic in 2021,\" Raskin said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden outlines executive orders planned for first 10 days\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will sign more than a dozen executive orders on his first day in office reversing key Trump Administration policies on issues from immigration to climate change, Biden’s transition team announced Saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the day Biden is inaugurated as president, his executive actions will include:\n\nAsking the Department of Education to extend the pause on student loan payments and interests on federal student loans\n\nRejoin the Paris Agreement, which focuses on goals to help mitigate climate change\n\nReverse the travel ban for Muslim-majority countries\n\nHe will also enact orders that address the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. As president, he will launch his \"100 Day Masking Challenge,\" which includes a mask mandate on federal property and inter-state travel. He will also extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures.\n\nOn Biden’s second day in office, he will sign more executive actions addressing the pandemic that will \"change the course of the COVID-19 crisis and safely re-open schools and businesses,\" the transition team said. He will take actions that aim to mitigate the spread of the virus by expanding testing, protecting workers and establishing public health standards.\n\nOn his third day in office, Biden will direct his Cabinet agencies to take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families, though the transition team did not provide specifics.\n\nBetween Jan. 25 and Feb. 1, Biden will sign more executive actions, memoranda and issues additional Cabinet directives, including ones addressing equity and support in communities of color and underserved communities, and criminal justice system reforms.\n\nBiden also plans to sign more executive actions addressing the climate crisis, in addition to taking his first steps to expand access to health care. And he will begin reuniting families separated at the border. As of December, 628 parents who were separated from their children at the border are still missing.\n\n– Rebecca Morin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/03/deity-purgatory-virgin-snake-birth-slug-dough-traps-news-around-states/118529798/", "title": "'Deity' in Purgatory, virgin snake birth: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nSept. 3, 2021, 12:17 p.m. ET\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Jordan-Hare Stadium will officially be at full capacity for Auburn football games in 2021, the university said in a release outlining what game days will look like this year. Face coverings are recommended but not required in open-air spaces, the release said. However, the university requires masks in indoor spaces, so fans using elevators, premium indoor seating or transit buses will need to bring them. While some schools such as LSU are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for stadium entry, Auburn is not. Tiger Walk will be back, but the team’s pregame procession into the stadium will be shortened. The traditional pregame war eagle flight is also returning this year. The marching band will be allowed on the field for pregame and halftime festivities after being prohibited from the field last season. The university is encouraging fans to use digital ticketing through mobile devices. Merchandising and concessions inside Jordan-Hare will be cashless and contact-free, but game programs will still sell in and around the stadium for $10 cash.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Plastic is no longer a choice when checking out from stores in Anchorage. A ban on plastic bags is back in force in Alaska’s largest city after a temporary suspension during the pandemic, Alaska’s News Source reports. As of Wednesday, the option when checking out is paper or reusable options. The ban first took effect in 2019, but Assembly member Felix Rivera said it was relaxed during the pandemic in part because the supply chain for paper bags was disrupted. There were also concerns about whether reusable bags could transmit the coronavirus, he said. “I think since last year, we’ve learned a lot about the virus, and now nothing that I am reading leads me to have a lot of concern about reusable bags transmitting the virus,” he told the Anchorage television station.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a process that some people call a “virgin birth,” a Brazilian rainbow boa was born at the Phoenix Zoo with DNA from only one parent. Its mom, who has been at the zoo for 10 years, has never been paired for mating. Imagine the keepers’ surprise when the baby boa was discovered in the snake’s enclosure Aug. 3. The snake was likely born through parthenogenesis, in which one – or multiple – eggs mature without fertilization. The zoo believes this is the second documented birth of its kind among Brazilian rainbow boas. Mom is currently in the Boa Hut on the Forest of Uco Trail, and the zoo plans to house the baby in a reptile nursery on the Children’s Trail. So-called virgin births, or asexual reproduction, may not be that uncommon among vertebrates. Thelma, a reticulated python at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, gave birth to six baby pythons without a partner in 2014. “Once considered an evolutionary novelty, facultative parthenogenesis has now been documented in an increasing number of vertebrate species, ranging from the hammerhead shark to domestic turkeys, komodo dragons to snakes,” Warren Booth, an associate professor of molecular ecology at the University of Tulsa who studies the phenomenon, said in a statement in 2016.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several inmates say they weren’t told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used for that purpose. Three inmates at the Washington County jail said they didn’t know they were being given ivermectin until its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said it’s heard similar complaints from inmates. The inmates’ comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail’s physician that use of the drug was voluntary. “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for the virus. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients. Edrick Floreal-Wooten said he was given ivermectin after testing positive Aug. 21. “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” Floreal-Wooten said. He said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates. “Never. I’m not livestock,” he said. “I’m a human.” The ACLU said it has also heard from inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon force large department stores to display some child products in gender-neutral ways after the Legislature passed a bill Wednesday aimed at getting rid of traditional pink and blue marketing schemes for items like toys and toothbrushes. The bill would not outlaw boys and girls sections in department stores but would require retailers to have a gender-neutral section to display “a reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” It would only apply to department stores with 500 or more employees, so most small businesses would be exempt. It also wouldn’t apply to clothes, just toys and “childcare items,” which include hygiene and teething products. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly for a procedural vote before it heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. If it becomes law, California would become the first state to require these sections in stores, according to the office of Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, the bill’s author. He said the measure was inspired by a 10-year-old whose mother works in his legislative office. “Britten asked her mom while shopping why certain things in a store were ‘off limits’ to her because she was a girl but would be fine if she was a boy,” Low said. “Thankfully, my colleagues recognized the pure intentions of this bill and the need to let kids be kids.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three suburban police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter that provoked national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. The grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Phil Weiser are the latest chapter for the police department in the city of Aurora, which has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. McClain’s death helped inspire a sweeping police accountability law in Colorado, a ban on chokeholds and restrictions on the use of the sedative ketamine, both of which the indictment alleges contributed to his death. The charges were announced days after the second anniversary of when police stopped McClain on the street after a 911 caller reported a man who seemed “sketchy.” “What I set out to do is still not over, but I’m halfway there. I’m halfway there,” McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, said of her efforts to hold police accountable. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over last year and has pledged to work to restore public trust, said the department will continue to cooperate with the judicial process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: A small jet crashed shortly after taking off from a small airport Thursday morning, killing all four people aboard, officials said. The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the building has been accounted for, and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said. Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida overnight, officials said the city was seeing historic flooding Thursday. The Wilmington Fire Department and other agencies were performing water rescues, and many streets and bridges remained closed, officials said. Flooding affected several neighborhoods, and a Wilmington Fire Department spokesperson said crews had rescued 60 to 80 people by noon. Delaware Department of Transportation Community Relations Director CR McLeod said the flooding was affecting homes and businesses, and there were many vehicles underwater, WDEL-FM reports. More than 50 bridges would need to be surveyed and assessed, he said. “A lot of this water is coming down from Pennsylvania with the excessive amounts of rain that they had associated with the storm yesterday,” McLeod said. “All that water is going to make its way down toward the Delaware River, and it’s all coming down the Brandywine.” The Brandywine entered a major flood stage Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it reached a maximum crest of 23.1 feet, a new record, according to the National Weather Service. Waters began to recede, and the creek was expected to fall below flood stage early Friday, according to the agency.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital ranks last in the country for teacher pay compared to other jobs, WUSA-TV reports, citing a study from business.org. The July study compared the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers to the average salary for all jobs within each state and the district. The data was collected using the National Center for Education Statistics and compared with the salaries of all occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results found that D.C. and Virginia rank last in the country, with educators earning 17% and 10% less than the average wage, respectively. Virginia and D.C. are among seven states that the study claims pay teachers below the state’s average salary. The study reports that Mississippi has the lowest salary for teachers at just more than $45,000 per year, but that is still 8.6% higher than the average salary in the state. Pennsylvania ranked highest in the country, according to the study, with teachers earning 30% more than the average wage.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An elementary school was placed in a temporary, limited lockdown after a parent threatened to leave his job and confront an assistant principal for telling his children they couldn’t come to school without being masked. Christopher Kivlin was met by police officers Tuesday outside Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota. No charges were filed, but he was ordered not to come back to the school without calling first and getting permission. An incident report said Kivlin showed up to campus saying the school was violating the law by not allowing his children to attend school. The Sarasota County school district is among a dozen of Florida’s 67 districts, representing about half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students, that have defied Gov. Rob DeSantis’ executive order barring schools from requiring masks over parent objections. A judge last week ruled that DeSantis did not have the authority to issue the order. The DeSantis administration is expected to appeal the decision. Kivlin told television station WFLA he had no intention of hurting anyone but just wanted to talk to a school official. He apologized for scaring anyone and said that “it was just emotions built up.” “I found out after the fact that the school had to go into lockdown, I was like, ‘That’s horrible,’ ” Kivlin said. “I feel like I might have scared other parents.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge’s decision striking down a Trump-era rule that eliminated federal protections for some wetlands and streams is giving hope to opponents of a proposed mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge in southeast Georgia. A federal judge in Arizona on Monday tossed the rule that narrowed the types of U.S. waters that qualify for federal protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. The judge’s order, which applies nationwide, says the rule enacted under former President Donald Trump improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. One high-profile project directly affected by the environmental rollbacks under Trump was a proposal by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals to mine titanium dioxide on land about 3 miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge near the Georgia-Florida line. Conservationists fear mining close to the swamp’s edge could cause irreparable harm to the largest federal wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. Yet the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the project no longer required a federal permit because the rollbacks under Trump excluded wetlands on the site from federal protection. That left sole authority to Georgia state regulators to decide whether it could move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tourism officials have released a plan to reduce visitors on Oahu, the state’s most frequently visited and populous island. The plan was approved by the Hawaii Tourism Authority in July, and the full plan has now been released to the public, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Decreasing the total number of visitors to Oahu to a manageable level by controlling the number of visitor accommodations and exploring changes to land use, zoning and airport policies,” the plan says. It also establishes a regenerative tourism fee, creates reservation systems for natural and cultural sites, manages visitors’ use of cars, and promotes consumption of locally produced and sold goods. “We appreciate the Oahu residents who participated in the (plan) process and passionately contributed their diverse viewpoints, discussed various tourism-related challenges in their neighborhoods and helped set forth an actionable plan that is necessary for the community’s well-being,” said John De Fries, the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s president and CEO. “It’s about continued collaboration and moving forward together to malama (care for) this cherished place and each other, as desired by the people of Oahu.” The three-year plan was developed by community members and county officials in collaboration with the tourism authority.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: At least two state lawmakers received threatening letters concerning their votes on a law intended to drastically reduce wolf numbers. The anonymous letters to Republican Sen. Dan Johnson and Republican Rep. Caroline Troy say that “just as the wolf went from predator to prey, so shall you.” It’s not clear how many more lawmakers received the letters. The Lewiston Tribune reports some of the lawmakers contacted the Idaho State Police. Backers of the wolf law that took effect July 1 said the state can cut the number of wolves to 150 before federal authorities would take over management. That would be a 90% reduction of the state’s 1,500 wolves. The letters describe lawmakers as “nothing more than a sellout to the Cattle Association and that pitiful minority of cattle producers that seemingly dictate how our wildlife lives and dies.” Johnson said the envelope had a Sacramento postmark, and the return address was the Statehouse in Boise. “It’s OK for people to disagree with my votes or my bills, but some comments cross the line,” he said. “I think this letter comes close to the line, if not stepping over it.” The law passed the Senate 26-7 with no support from Democrats. It passed the House 58-11 with one Democrat in support and no Republicans opposed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Rowers, kayakers and other users of the Chicago River are getting a real-time look at one measure of water quality in the system that weaves through downtown and several neighborhoods. Chicago nonprofit Current installed three sensors in the river’s three main branches in 2019 to continuously estimate the amount of bacteria from human and other warm-blooded animals’ waste. The organization initially planned to begin making the real-time results public in 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic delayed its plans until Thursday, when a website updating with data taken every 15 minutes went online. The city’s development in the 19th century was thanks to the river – truly a system of rivers and manmade canals – that provided a path between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system. While the meatpacking and lumber industries could use it for shipping, the waterway also became a dumping ground for those and other industries and for sewage from homes and businesses. Quality of the 156-mile river system has improved in recent years, helped by multibillion-dollar construction of new reservoirs and underground tunnels. But when rain overwhelms Chicago’s sewer systems, sewage and stormwater is diverted to the river, prompting warnings to stay off the water for several days.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Schools got an incentive from the governor Wednesday to require face masks in classrooms in hopes of slowing down the number of COVID-19 outbreaks among students. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a new statewide executive order that eases quarantine requirements for students if all children and adults in the school were wearing masks throughout the day. The revised order comes as many Indiana schools have seen COVID-19 outbreaks and as the state’s vaccination rate remains stubbornly low. Holcomb said the coronavirus’ spread in Indiana was regrettable but avoidable. “To the skeptics or unbelievers or deniers, I would just plead to look at the facts, to look at the numerical data that shows we can all stay safe if you get vaccinated,” Holcomb said. Meanwhile, the state’s largest hospital system will be stopping all inpatient nonemergency surgeries as the state faces a growing surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Indiana University Health announced Thursday that the surgery suspension would start Monday. The decision comes after IU Health said last week that it was cutting such surgeries by half. IU Health, which operates 16 hospitals around the state, also said that more than 1,000 employees did not meet Wednesday’s deadline to get COVID-19 vaccinations and would be suspended immediately.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A federal judge on Thursday ordered a prominent participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to return to jail after he was caught accessing the internet to watch false conspiracy theories about the presidential election. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said Doug Jensen, 42, of Des Moines, had violated the strict conditions that were set when he was released from jail July 13, including prohibitions on accessing the internet and using a cellphone. Prosecutors had moved to revoke Jensen’s pretrial release Aug. 19, days after a federal officer found Jensen in his garage using an iPhone to watch news from Rumble, a streaming platform popular with conservatives. Jensen acknowledged that he had earlier watched two days of the cyber symposium sponsored by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who used the event to push false theories that the 2020 election’s outcome was changed by Chinese hackers. Kelly noted that he had released Jensen from jail in July after Jensen claimed he had an awakening behind bars and realized the QAnon conspiracy theory to which he adhered was a “pack of lies.” The judge said it was significant that Jensen’s violations were caught during the first unannounced visit to his home by pretrial services officers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About a third of Kansas nursing homes have less than half of their health care workers vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data released by the state. Just four of the more than 300 federally licensed nursing homes are meeting the state’s goal for 90% of health care workers vaccinated, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows. The departments released the data about a week after President Joe Biden announced that his administration will require nursing home staff to be vaccinated as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. The department for aging and disability services said in a statement last week that it released the data to prepare for those new rules. Gov. Laura Kelly’s office said in a statement, without offering details, that the administration would encourage nursing home workers to get inoculated. As of Wednesday, about 46% of Kansans were fully vaccinated, according to data provided by the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A judge has refused to grant a divorce decree to a couple who swore under oath that their marriage was irreparably broken. The reason, she said: They were too nice to each other in court. In a decision condemned by divorce lawyers, Bullitt Family Court Judge Monica Meredith at least temporarily declined to dissolve Douglas and Nicole Potts’ 13-year marriage, which both insist can’t be salvaged. In an Aug. 23 order continuing the case and suggesting the couple undergo counseling, Meredith observed they were “respectful and courteous toward one another, and both held themselves in dignified and mature composure.” Meredith, who was elected to Family Court in 2018, said that “divorce court does not typically bring that demeanor out in its participants.” But in interviews and emails, a half-dozen family lawyers said Meredith’s order was inappropriate, unlawful and ridiculous. “It sends a terrible message to litigants: You are better served by acting like a petulant child in court than by acting mature,” said Louisville attorney Hal Helmers, who wasn’t involved in the case. Louise Graham, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, said counseling may be ordered only if one side disagrees the marriage is over. “Ninety-nine percent of divorce lawyers agree with the above, and we can never agree on ANYTHING,” Helmers said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: Photos show what appears to be a miles-long oil slick near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida, according to aerial survey imagery released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reviewed by the Associated Press. The government imagery, along with additional photos taken by the AP from a helicopter Tuesday, also show Louisiana port facilities, oil refineries and shipyards in the storm’s path where the telltale rainbow sheen typical of oil and fuel spills is visible in the water of bays and bayous. Both state and federal regulators said Wednesday that they had been unable to reach the stricken area, citing challenging conditions in the disaster zone. The NOAA photos show a black slick floating in the Gulf near a large rig with the name Enterprise Offshore Drilling painted on its helipad. Aerial photos taken by NOAA on Tuesday also show significant flooding to the massive Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery along the bank of the Mississippi River, just south of New Orleans. In some sections of the refinery, rainbow sheen is visible on the water leading toward the river. Asked about reports of levee failures near the refinery Monday, Phillips 66 spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there was “some water” in the facility and stressed that operations were shut down before the storm.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Newly unionized nurses at Maine Medical Center are frustrated over the end of pandemic accommodations. The policies had let high-risk employees work outside COVID-19 care, covered COVID-19 treatment costs, provided quarantine pay for coronavirus exposure outside the workplace and allowed pregnant nurses to start paid maternity leave in the last month of their pregnancy. “In the middle of a spike in infections from a fast-moving variant, this is not the time to remove the protections that have helped both staff and patients here for the past several months,” nurse Madison Light said. The surge is causing nurses to scramble to staff the COVID-19 units. They’re not getting enough breaks, they said. “Now it feels like there is no end in sight. Nurses and caregivers are exhausted, frustrated, and stretched to their physical and emotional limits,” Light said. MaineHealth said its policies on COVID-19 exposure and pregnancy leave follow current clinical and OSHA guidelines. Accommodations for high-risk employees are considered on a case-by-case basis, the company said.\n\nMaryland\n\nThurmont: First responders in western Maryland used a boat to rescue 10 children and a driver from a school bus caught in rising floodwaters as the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon. Frederick County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Todd Wivell said the bus got stuck when it tried to cross a bridge in the Thurmont area that had water going across it, WTOP-FM reports. The driver and 10 children were rescued from the bus by boat, with the help of first responders from the sheriff’s office and the Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, he said. Even 6 inches of moving water is enough to knock a person off their feet, Wivell said. Frederick County Public Schools recalled all school buses that were in the process of dropping students off. Parents were asked to pick their kids up from school buildings. Frederick County Public Schools’ Superintendent Terry Alban apologized after facing criticism for not dismissing children early, saying the decision to remain open for a full day led to “stress and anxiety for many,” The Frederick News-Post reports. School systems in neighboring counties sent students home early ahead of forecasted inclement weather.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A question that would require voters to present an ID and a second that would grant new benefits for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft while stopping short of declaring them employees have cleared an initial hurdle on their way to next year’s ballot. Other proposed initiatives that received a constitutional green light from Attorney General Maura Healey’s office Wednesday would legalize the sale of fireworks, create a “whale safe fishing act,” allow for the return of “happy hours,” and create a “Right to Counsel Program” for those facing eviction. The questions were among 16 proposed laws and one proposed constitutional amendment that met the requirements for ballot initiatives outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution, according to Healey’s office. Another 13 proposals were deemed unconstitutional. The state constitution requires proposed initiatives be in the proper form to present to voters, not be substantially the same as any measure on the ballot in either of the two preceding statewide elections, contain only subjects related to each other and not involve topics specifically excluded from the ballot initiative process.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Thousands of Flint residents were put at potential risk because a New York law firm, for six months, used handheld X-ray devices to scan their bones for lead without first registering the devices and putting recommended safety measures in place, documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press show. Starting in about August 2020, the Napoli Shkolnik firm used the portable scanners – which are tools in the mining and scrap metal industries but are not designed for use on humans – as a way of bolstering residents’ claims for larger shares of a proposed $641.25 million settlement of civil lawsuits arising from the 2014 lead poisoning of Flint’s drinking water supply. The law firm’s failure until February 2021 to register the devices with the state of Michigan, as required by law, and the state’s low-key response once it learned the scanners had been used for months without required approvals add insult to the injury that was the Flint drinking water crisis. “Unfortunately, thousands of bone scans using these devices ... went forward under improper and illegal circumstances,” said Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician and former president and CEO of Mott’s Children’s Health Center, who first raised concerns about the scanners in a February court filing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys for three former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death asked a judge Thursday to bar their upcoming trial from being livestreamed, saying some witnesses won’t testify if the proceedings are broadcast. The request from attorneys for Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao is an about-face from their earlier request to have the trial publicly broadcast, and it is opposed by prosecutors and news outlets. Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to stand trial next March on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 2020 death. Their co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter after weeks of proceedings that marked the first time in Minnesota that a criminal trial was livestreamed in its entirety. Before Chauvin’s trial, attorneys for all four men requested the trials be broadcast, but Lane and Kueng recently backtracked, with their attorneys saying that the “worldwide publicity” from televised coverage of Chauvin’s trail “crushed” their clients’ right to a fair trial. Attorneys Earl Gray and Tom Plunkett say the public access led some witnesses to decline testifying for the defense, noting one witness in the Chauvin trial has been harassed and another faced professional scrutiny.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The U.S. Marshals Service has arrested a man in connection with an assault on an MSNBC reporter during a live broadcast from the state Monday. Benjamin Dagley was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a shopping center in Dayton, Ohio, according to a report. With the assistance of the public, the Gulfport Police Department identified Dagley, of Wooster, Ohio, as a suspect in an assault on Shaquille Brewster as he covered Hurricane Ida. Dagley allegedly pulled up in white pickup truck and ran toward the camera crew. The suspect could be heard off-camera repeatedly screaming something about reporting the hurricane accurately. Brewster attempted to go on with the live coverage, even shifting his position to move away from the suspect, but when he realized the accused was not backing down, Brewster tossed it back to the studio. As the camera faded, viewers could see Brewster being physically confronted. Gulfport police issued warrants Tuesday charging Dagley with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbance of the peace and one count of violating emergency curfew. Police also said Dagley is on probation for a previous charge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state senator from Kansas City said he is demanding answers after an exhibit on the gay rights movement in Missouri was removed from the state Capitol. Democrat Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay member of the Missouri Senate, said he was “appalled” when he was told the exhibit, “Making History: Kansas City and the Rise of Gay Rights,” had been removed from the Missouri State Museum. Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources, did not immediately reply to questions about why the exhibit was moved and who made the decision. On Tuesday, Uriah Stark, legislative aide for state Rep. Mitch Boggs, R-La Russell, posted pictures of the exhibit on Facebook and questioned why the “taxpayer funded museum is pushing the LGBT agenda in our state capitol?” The next day, Stark thanked “several of our great elected officials” for having the exhibit removed, specifically mentioning Republican Reps. Ann Kelley, of Lamar, and Brian Seitz, of Branson, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “There is NOTHING controversial about an exhibit that explains how members of the LGBT community fought to end persecution and demand rights as citizens,” Razer tweeted Thursday. “I’m extremely disappointed and angry that @mostateparks may think otherwise.”\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park is ending its reservation requirement to travel on the Going-to-the-Sun Road after Labor Day as the busy summer season winds down. The reservation system has been in place for anyone wanting to travel on the scenic highway since May 28. Reservations were required between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. The pilot program testing the reservation system worked to alleviate traffic, but park officials said some people struggled to find available tickets. The park’s shuttle service will also end after Labor Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government is stepping in to help shuffle patients between local hospitals that are dealing with a surge of people with COVID-19 and other health issues, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. The Republican governor said the state has partnered with Nomi Health, the creators of the TestNebraska program, to offer call centers that overcrowded hospitals can contact when they need to transfer patients elsewhere. The around-the-clock call centers will serve as coordinators for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed, at a cost of $200,000 a month. The announcement is another sign that the state is once again struggling with coronavirus cases, even though most of the hospitalizations are patients without the coronavirus. State officials opened a similar call center last year but ended the program after the number of cases and hospitalizations declined. The new call center is scheduled to open Saturday. Nebraska’s hospitals reported to the state Wednesday that 72% of their 3,234 beds were occupied, although some facilities were far more crowded and having to send patients to other places. Ricketts relaxed licensing restrictions for nurses last week in an attempt to fix severe staffing shortages.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. said Wednesday that a conference scheduled next month in Las Vegas by a group espousing the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon won’t be held at any Caesars property. It wasn’t immediately clear if the “Patriot Double Down” event organized by Patriot Voice would be moved, postponed or canceled. Caesars Entertainment executive Kate Whiteley confirmed a Las Vegas Review-Journal report that the Oct. 23-25 event billed as a “Great Awakening Weekend” won’t be held at the new Caesars Forum convention space near the Las Vegas Strip. With tickets from $650 to $3,000, the conference was billed to feature speakers including former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and 8kun website owner Jim Watkins. QAnon is a theory featuring the baseless belief that satanic pedophiles, child sex traffickers and cannibals are in collusion with the so-called deep state and will be uncovered at a reckoning followers call a “Great Awakening.” QAnon signs are often seen at rallies for ex-President Donald Trump, and some adherents are facing trial for roles in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The group also derides the COVID-19 pandemic as a “plandemic,” suggesting the coronavirus was manufactured and its severity exaggerated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it’s experiencing staff shortages during the coronavirus pandemic that range from nursing positions to food service workers. The health care system said Wednesday that it organized a “Managing and Staffing to Capacity” task force to identify solutions to the shortage, especially in the inpatient units and other care areas at its flagship hospital in Lebanon. Dartmouth-Hitchcock also began planning for reallocation of resources and staff. Earlier this year, it increased the starting rate for newly licensed nurses to $30 per hour and made wage adjustments for experienced clinical nurses and nurse supervisors. It plans to provide a 2% wage increase for other staff beginning in October. Joni Menard, task force leader, said that “the overall situation continues to be challenging as clinical demand increases and the supply of traveling staff is depleted across the nation.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Murphy administration officials used an unapproved encryption app at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and deleted correspondence “on at least one occasion,” according to new court records. The alleged use of the encrypted messaging application Telegram by Department of Health officials shows the limits of New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act and the ability to skirt them and other laws and rules, experts said. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy revealed that health officials were communicating on Telegram in the administration’s latest legal filing in the whistleblower lawsuit brought by Christopher Neuwirth, an assistant health commissioner who was fired shortly after first-wave peak of the coronavirus. In a 308-page response countering Neuwirth’s claim that he was improperly fired last May, Murphy’s lawyers said Neuwirth required employees who reported to him “use a non-state-approved messaging application – Telegram – furthering burdening those state employees.” The Open Public Records Act does not specifically address encrypted messages but does include emails and text messages used for official business in its definition of government records. Such records are subject to public access unless they fall under one of more than two dozen exemptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta officials say they’re canceling some parts of the event and will require guests to wear masks to enter the grounds and while in indoor areas and crowded outdoor settings to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Wednesday he didn’t believe that face mask requirements and other safety practices would affect attendance numbers for the Oct. 2-10 event. “Masks have been a way of life that we’ve all been experiencing for the past year or more, so I think it’s one of those things that people are used to,” he said. The music fiesta is being canceled this year due to close proximity of guests, and the discovery center is being shelved because of its indoor nature featuring activities with multiple touchpoints, officials said. Other steps being taken include providing cashless options to buy tickets, moving hospitality seating outdoors and increasing spacing between popular special-shape balloons inside the park, officials said. The changes track federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and the current public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Democratic-led Legislature voted Wednesday to extend an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for commercial and residential tenants who fell behind on their rent because of hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had called the Legislature to return for an “extraordinary session” to pass the legislation, which will put evictions on hold until Jan. 15. New York’s previous eviction moratorium, which included foreclosure protections for property owners, expired Tuesday. In an Aug. 12 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court nixed part of the moratorium that allowed tenants to pause eviction proceedings simply by filing a form declaring they’d had a COVID-19-related financial hardship or that moving in a pandemic would prove a health risk. The court said landlords should have the ability to challenge those hardships in court. New York is poised to change how the moratorium works in light of that ruling. Landlords will be able to challenge hardship declarations and direct judges to require tenants with hardships to apply for rental assistance. Hochul said the legislation will stand up to legal scrutiny. But the leader of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest organization of landlords in New York, vowed Wednesday to sue to block the moratorium in federal court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The majority of public school students taking standardized state exams in reading, math and science last school year failed them, data shows. State education leaders cautioned against making year-over-year comparisons with the tests taken during a school year marked by limited in-person instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 45.4% of K-12 students passed the exams for the 2020-21 school year, according to results released at a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday. Two years ago – the last time testing was required – nearly 59% of K-12 students passed state exams. The U.S. Education Department did not require states to test students in the 2019-20 school year but required it this past year to assess pandemic learning loss. Because of coronavirus safety concerns, some high school students this past year took exams months after completing the course on which they were being tested. Some tests were revised, and a lower-than-normal share of students took them, news outlets report. “While the 2018-19 data is included as a way to provide context, comparison of the two years should only be made with a recognition that multiple anomalies occurred during the 2020-21 school year and during test administration,” state board member Jill Camnitz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A lawmaker who heads the state’s anti-abortion legislative caucus said Thursday that it’s likely the Republican-led Legislature will seek to pass a measure mirroring a new Texas law that virtually bans all abortions and that the Supreme Court has allowed to remain in force. GOP Sen. Janne Myrdal, one of the Legislature’s most ardent anti-abortion lawmakers, said she “assumes” legislation will be crafted eventually that uses the Texas law as a template. “I hear people talking about it,” Myrdal said. About a third of the Legislature’s 141 members are active in the caucus, which already has successfully pushed some of the nation’s toughest abortion laws. If it is drafted, it’s unclear when it would be introduced, though it could happen when the Legislature meets later this year in a reconvened or special session meant to deal with legislative redistricting. North Dakota is one of several states that have so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Myrdal said the high court’s action – or lack thereof – offers “a glimmer of hope” the court might eventually overturn Roe v. Wade because of its shift to the right following the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief this week launched an effort to purge inactive voters from state rolls, while using the announcement to push for passage of a bill making several changes to Ohio’s election process. The four-year process for purging inactive voters targets those who have not voted for two years and whose addresses may have changed and whose voter registration must be updated to reflect the move, according to Wednesday’s directive by GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose to Ohio’s 88 county elections boards. Inactive voters can keep themselves on the rolls by voting in any election in the next four years, submitting an absentee ballot application, registering to vote or taking other election-related steps. Earlier this year, LaRose said 97,795 inactive voter files were removed in scheduled post-2020 election voter roll maintenance, a lower number than predicted after thousands of voters avoided the purge by voting and undertaking other election activities. In his announcement Wednesday, LaRose also urged for the passage of a Republican voting bill introduced this spring that prohibits the placement of ballot drop boxes anywhere but at local elections offices, eliminates a day of early voting, shortens the window for requesting mail-in ballots and tightens voter ID requirements.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge on Wednesday said she will temporarily block a state law banning public school mask mandates, but students or their parents can opt out of the requirement if they choose. Judge Natalie Mai said she will issue a temporary injunction that will go into effect next week when she issues a written order detailing her ruling. Mai said she is blocking the law because it applies only to public, not private, schools, and schools adopting a mask mandate must provide an option for parents or students to opt out of the requirement. The ruling drew praise from Gov. Kevin Stitt, who signed the law and opposes mask mandates without exemptions, and Dr. Mary Clarke, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, which joined the lawsuit brought by four parents who oppose the law. “This is a victory for parental choice, personal responsibility and the rule of law,” Stitt said in a statement. Clarke said she was also pleased with the ruling. “This is just a first step in ensuring our schools maintain local control and can choose the best path for their students, faculty and staff,” Clarke said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Slugs and snails love bread dough, finds recent research from the Oregon State University Extension Service and other universities, suggesting a cheap, easy-to-make, nontoxic and widely available solution for gardeners and farmers alike. The state’s grass seed industry loses roughly $100 million a year to the slimy pests, according to the Oregon Seed Council. “Slugs and snails have a big impact on seed crops,” said Roger Beyer, the council’s executive director. “Our guys will work with anything, be it biological, pesticides or chemicals – whatever it takes to protect their crops, but it has to be economical.” The Oregon Seed Council provides $60,000 to $70,000 a year to fund slug and snail research at OSU, including for the work of gastropod specialist Rory McDonnell, who participated in the multi-university study that discovered bread dough attracts the pests. McDonnell and his fellow researchers ran simple experiments comparing how slugs and snails are attracted to different foods, essentially pitting foods in head-to-head contests until one was determined the most attractive. Cucumber was an early front-runner, and beer and strawberries did well, but bread dough was what really called the mollusks to dinner. McDonnell said it might be deployed in the creation of molluscicides, but dough should work for now.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change passed its last regulatory hurdle Wednesday, in a hard-fought bid to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. The plan to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants won a 3-2 party-line vote from the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, a five-member panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees. The commission voted after almost six hours of testimony and nearly two years of Wolf’s administration working on the regulation and shepherding it through the long regulatory process. The vote allows Pennsylvania, through regulation, to join a multistate consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By joining the consortium, “Pennsylvania is taking a historic, proactive and progressive approach that will have significant positive environmental, public health and economic impacts,” Wolf said in a statement after the vote. Mark Szybist, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it the “most important climate action that Pennsylvania has taken in more than a decade.” At 34%, Pennsylvania’s energy sector is its largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: Some residents will be paying more for their health insurance next year, but not as much as insurers wanted them to pay, the state Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner said Thursday. The rate increases for 2022 approved by Commissioner Patrick Tigue were lower than insurers has requested. “As Rhode Islanders confront significant threats to their health and financial well-being due to the spread of COVID-19, my responsibility is to limit the burden of the cost of health insurance within the standards for review and approval set forth by law,” Tigue said in a statement. “Given the strong reserve positions of health insurers operating in the state, I did not believe that charges for profit and contributions to reserves for 2022 were consistent with the proper conduct of the insurers’ business or consistent with the public interest.” Rhode Islanders will save almost $42 million in 2022 compared to what the commercial health insurers requested, his office said. For Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which has 40,255 members in its small group plan and requested an average rate increase of 2.9%, Tigue approved a 0.3% decrease. Gail Carvelli, a spokesperson for BCBSRI, told The Boston Globe the company accepted the modifications and recognized the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Thursday tossed out a school mask mandate in the capital city, saying it contradicts a state budget measure aimed at preventing face covering requirements. State Attorney General Alan Wilson had sued Columbia after the City Council passed the ordinance requiring masks at elementary and middle schools. City leaders said the mask requirement, which carries a $100 violation fine, was meant to protect children too young to be approved for COVID-19 vaccines. But Wilson argued the city’s mask rule conflicts with the budget requirement that went into effect July 1 and bans school districts from using appropriated funds to require face coverings. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court sided unanimously with the attorney general. The Columbia ordinance is written so that the burden of enforcing the mask rule falls on school employees, “all of whom have an obvious connection to state-appropriated funds,” wrote Justice John Kittredge. That means school employees have to choose between violating state or city laws, the opinion said. “The City has made clear that every school employee is in the crosshairs,” Kittredge wrote.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers looking to remake the state’s voter-passed medical marijuana law previewed a coming battle in the Legislature on Wednesday as they recommended outlawing growing the plant in homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. A legislative subcommittee approved a spate of recommended changes to a ballot measure approved by 70% of voters last year. The law is set to take full effect in the coming months as the state government faces deadlines to issue medical marijuana identification cards and provide for the licensure of dispensaries. However, the law will continue to be in flux. Republicans, who dominate the Legislature, are currently debating just how far to go in changing the law. The subcommittee on Wednesday recommended changes that could potentially make it more difficult for people in rural areas to access the drug – most significantly by striking all provisions allowing medical marijuana ID-card holders to grow cannabis plants in their homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. The recommendations will next face approval by the Marijuana Interim Study Committee before they can be passed to the full Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state Department of Education video celebrating the return to school drew sharp criticism across social media. The 41-second video released Tuesday features Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who shares her own memories of excitedly starting school as a kindergartner. “All of our students – 1 million of them – across the state of Tennessee are starting the school year right now,” Schwinn says. “The smell of new books, clean hallways, the energy and feeling of being back in classrooms with their friends and their teachers. It’s such a special time, and I am so excited for our state.” She then asks parents to share stories about why they are excited for the new school year in the comments. The video received swift feedback from parents and teachers experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, quarantines and a growing number of schools already closing as the coronavirus spreads. As of Wednesday, Tennessee was averaging a record-setting 2,330 infections per day among school-age children, ages 5 to 18, according to state data. “How tone deaf do you have to be to ask parents to ‘share their stories’?” commenter Joshua Allen said on Facebook. Several commenters said they sent kids back to school after 18 months of avoiding the virus only to have their children exposed or infected within a few weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The state on Wednesday became the 20th and largest in the nation to allow some form of the unregulated carry of a firearm. Under the new law, most people 21 or older who haven’t been convicted of a felony can carry a holstered handgun – concealed or otherwise – in public without undergoing any training or getting a permit. Supporters of the law, including Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature, laud it as a necessary expansion of the so-called constitutional carry movement that will allow people to more easily defend themselves without government interference. But critics, including some law enforcement groups and others, say this further loosening of firearms restrictions in a state that has had more than its share of mass shootings is reckless. Until Wednesday, Texans needed a license to carry a handgun outside their homes and vehicles. To get one, they had to submit fingerprints, go through several hours of training on gun laws and gun safety, and pass a shooting proficiency test. Now, they can still take an online training course that the law requires the state to provide, but it is not necessary. While recent mass shootings have put many on edge, Texas has cultivated a strong culture of gun ownership with echoes of the Wild West, and many residents support the loosened restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A suspect charged with setting fire to three churches in the city and then leading police on a high-speed chase across Washington County that didn’t end until he crashed his minivan inside Zion National Park told police he was a “type of deity” who was acting in “righteous anger.” The man was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on seven separate charges, including two second-degree felony counts of arson and a third-degree felony count of failing to stop for a police officer, according to a report filed in 5th District Court. Local fire officials and federal agents had been investigating the string of fires as a possible hate crime, as all three happened at houses of worship of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. The suspect, a 36-year-old identified as Benjamin Johnson, was being held without bail. The police report suggests investigators worried that he could be a danger to the community and that his mental health was a consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A refugee resettlement organization is offering to accept about 100 Afghan refugees over the next several weeks if its proposal is approved by the U.S. State Department. Amila Merdzanovic of the Vermont chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said that if the request is approved, the state’s well-publicized housing crisis will prompt her organization to look for families to host at least some of the new arrivals. It would not be the first time refugees arriving in Vermont lived with host families. “In the 1970s and 1980s when Laotians and Cambodians were coming into the state, there was no refugee resettlement program, so people were being hosted by Vermonters,” said Merdzanovic, who came to Vermont in 1995 as a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina and lived with a host family when she first arrived. “That’s the model we are looking to implement.” She said Thursday that since word of the proposal first became public Wednesday, she has already received dozens of messages of support. Historically, Vermont has not been a location where refugees with the types of visas granted to the Afghans have been resettled. Merdzanovic said last week she was not expecting any Afghans, but she learned Aug. 25 that refugee resettlement agencies had two days to submit proposals.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the state can remove an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a prominent spot in its capital city, saying that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The 7-0 decision cited testimony from historians that the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the Southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. More than a century later, its continued display “communicates principles that many believe to be inconsistent with the values the Commonwealth currently wishes to express,” the justices ruled. The high court’s decision came in two lawsuits filed by residents who attempted to block Gov. Ralph Northam’s order to remove the bronze equestrian sculpture, which shows Lee in military attire atop a massive stone pedestal. Virginia promised to forever maintain the statue in the 1887 and 1890 deeds that transferred its ownership to the state. But the justices said that obligation no longer applies. “Those restrictive covenants are unenforceable as contrary to public policy and for being unreasonable because their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees,” the justices wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, the state’s most populous county is reinstating outdoor mask mandates for large events and strongly encouraging people to wear masks in other outdoor settings when they can’t remain 6 feet apart. In a statement Thursday, Public Health – Seattle & King County said as of Tuesday there will be a requirement for face masks for outdoor events of 500 or more people. The directive applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people over age 5. The recommendation for outdoor masks when people are unable to socially distance from non-household members is also for people 5 and up regardless of vaccination status. “With high rates of disease spread, and our health care system straining to keep up, it is time to take additional steps to keep ourselves and our communities safe,” the health agency said. King County, which includes Seattle, is home to about 2.2 million people. Just last week County Executive Dow Constantine had boasted that King County had one of the highest vaccination rates of any large county in the U.S. As of last week, more than 70% of people 12 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal mine officials have instructed state environmental regulators to propose a change to West Virginia’s mine cleanup program. The federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is giving the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection 60 days to submit an amendment to its reclamation program, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. An Aug. 23 letter from federal officials to state officials said a review found that the program “has not taken sufficient steps” to make sure reclamation obligations are estimated correctly. Such a failure can lead to unfunded environmental liabilities, the letter said. “The WVDEP recognizes the concerns raised in OSMRE’s notice related to reporting and disclosure and those issues will be addressed,” Environmental Protection Department Secretary Harold Ward said in a statement Wednesday, without specifying what kind of amendment the agency plans to submit. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s review of the state’s reclamation program follows lawsuits filed by environmentalist groups.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Calling the situation horrific and inexcusable, city, county and state leaders said this week that they are committed to doing what it takes to improve conditions that leave Black renters in Milwaukee far more vulnerable to electrical fires than anybody else in the city. “These people paid for a place that ultimately took their lives,” said State Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, who represents part of the city most affected by suspected electrical fires. “That’s inexcusable. ... I have no choice but to find a way to get this addressed. I honestly didn’t know that people were literally losing their lives and everything they own like this.” Johnson said she plans to reach out to Gov. Tony Evers’ office and work with colleagues in the Legislature to consider changes that could help tackle the problem. The reaction follows a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that uncovered how suspected electrical fires disproportionately harm Black renters in the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and how systems at all levels of government fail to address the underlying issues. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Evers said. “It’s very disheartening.” Evers said he already has spoken to staff members about potential ways to address the problem, which he blamed largely on legislative changes in the last decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city expects to face labor shortages across all industries as school-related coronavirus cases spike, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Quarantines and illnesses among children are forcing parents to stay home with their kids, according to the paper, and the problem has already caused issues at day cares.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/21/senate-impeachment-trial-trump-rules-witnesses/4493149002/", "title": "Live Trump impeachment trial updates: Senate adopts rules", "text": "Jan. 21, 2020 Updated Jan. 22, 2020, 12:04 p.m. ET\n\nThe Senate adopted a resolution that outlines basic rules for how President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial will operate after a marathon hearing that stretched into the early morning hours and resulted in both House managers and the president’s defense team being admonished by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe Senate adopted a resolution in a party-line vote of 53-47.\n\nEach of the 11 amendments offered by Senate Democrats, which included measures subpoenaing a variety of entities and officials – including the White House and John Bolton – were defeated by the Republican-held Senate.\n\nThe resolution calls for opening arguments to begin Wednesday at 1 p.m. House managers and the president’s counsel will be given 24 hours over three days to argue the case. After that, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions of the two panels. At that time, senators will have the opportunity to vote on whether they want to hear from additional witnesses or see additional documents.\n\nRead the updates below if you missed any of the key moments from Tuesday's debate.\n\nSenate votes to kill Schumer's 9th and 10th amendment\n\nThe Senate voted to table two measures that would have provided for a vote on any motion to subpoena documents and witnesses and given additional time for parties to file responses to motions.\n\nThe rules as written, Democrats argued, did not allow for votes to be taken on documents and witnesses - only for a vote on a procedural motion to allow for later votes on documents and witnesses.\n\nThis amendment failed along party lines in a 53-47 vote.\n\nBoth Democrats and the president's counsel offered brief remarks about the 10th amendment but did not debate the measure in detail as the clock ticked closer to 1:30 a.m. Democrats wanted to allow each side additional time to respond to motions. This amendment failed in a 52-48 vote with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voting with Democrats. It was the first time a Republican had voted with Democrats throughout Tuesday's marathon debate.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nRoberts admonishes House managers, Trump's defense team for heated back-and-forth\n\nChief Justice John Roberts admonished both the House managers and the president’s counsel after a fiery back and forth debating whether John Bolton should be subpoenaed to testify before the Senate.\n\n“Those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,” Roberts told the panels, advising them to “use language conducive to civil discourse.\"\n\nThe talking to came after the president’s legal team got into a heated back-and-forth with Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who said if senators voted against subpoenaing Bolton they would be “part of the coverup.”\n\n“Either you want the truth and you must permit the witnesses or you want a shameful cover-up. History will judge and so will the electorate,” Nadler argued.\n\nCipollone shot back, calling for Nadler to apologize to the Senate, the president and “most of all, you owe an apology to the American people.”\n\n“Mr. Nadler came up here and made false allegations against our team. He made false allegations against all of you. He accused you of a coverup,” Cipollone said. “The only one who should be embarrassed, Mr. Nadler, is you for the way you've addressed this body. This is the United States Senate. You're not in charge here.”\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nSenate votes to table Schumer's eighth amendment as Senate trial goes on past midnight\n\nThe Senate voted 53-47 along party lines to table a measure subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe trial seemed it would continue later into the night, though, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced another amendment, the ninth of the day, to provide for a vote on any motion to subpoena documents and witnesses.\n\nThe rules as written, Democrats argued, did not allow for votes to be taken on documents and witnesses - only for a vote on a procedural motion to allow for later votes on documents and witnesses.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nCollins, others were behind McConnell altering resolution\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was one of the leading voices that led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to abruptly change his resolution that outlines how the president's trial will operate.\n\nMcConnell originally established that both House managers and the president's defense team would have 24 hours to present opening arguments and would be able to do this over two days, which would likely leave arguments stretching into the evening and early morning hours. The original resolution also did not automatically enter evidence gathered by the House into the Senate’s record.\n\nMcConnell announced Tuesday afternoon that he was altering the rules he proposed just one day earlier to allow the arguments to span over three days instead of two and allowing House evidence to automatically be entered into the Senate’s record.\n\nCollins joined Democrats in criticizing the resolution, causing McConnell to adjust the language before it was debated on the floor throughout the day and evening.\n\n“Senator Collins and others raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in 2 days and the admission of the House transcript in the record,” said Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for Collins. “Her position has been that the trial should follow the Clinton model as much as possible. She thinks these changes are a significant improvement.”\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nSenate votes to table seventh Democratic amendment as Schumer introduces subpoena for testimony from John Bolton\n\nThe Senate voted to table Schumer's amendment on the handling of evidence by a 53-47 vote.\n\nShortly after, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a subpoena for the testimony of former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nHouse Democrats invited Bolton to testify during the impeachment inquiry but Bolton failed to appear. Bolton said he would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchumer introduces seventh amendment on handling of evidence\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced Democrats' seventh attempt to amend the rules for the Senate trial.\n\nThe measure would require that any new documents admitted in the Senate trial that had previously been subpoenaed by the House be made available to members of both parties, which Democrats said would prevent the \"selective\" admission of evidence from the president.\n\nSpeaking in support of the measure, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the trial rules as written would allow the president to \"cherry-pick documents he has failed to provide to the House in an attempt to admit them into evidence here.\"\n\nRepublicans thought the amendment would not be necessary.\n\n\"This amendment doesn't have anything to do with the rule of completeness,\" shot back Patrick Philbin, Deputy counsel to the president.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSixth amendment calling for subpoenas fails\n\nThe Senate voted 53-47 to kill an amendment offered by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would have subpoenaed testimony from Robert Blair, an assistant to the president and adviser to Mulvaney, and Michael Duffey, a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBoth officials were key to the House’s impeachment inquiry but were blocked from testifying by the administration.\n\n“As a former judge, I have never seen anything like this before, where someone is ordered not to appear by one party and witnesses just don’t appear. The United States Senate should not allow the president and his admin to continue to evade accountability,” Rep. Sylvia Garcia, said in her arguments. “We need to hold him [the president] accountable because no one is above the law.”\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nSenators starting to doze off after hours of debate\n\nAs the night wore on, the hours of debate in Trump's impeachment trial appeared to take a toll on some senators. Several appeared to doze off, or at least begin to before catching themselves.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s eyes closed several times as House managers argued that officials and documents should be subpoenaed. As his body started to lean forward, falling deeper into sleep, he caught himself and jolted back.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., also nodded off multiple times as the night wore on. At one point, she dozed off, startled, and then immediately started writing something in her notes. Afterward, she shook her head lightly and stood up, leaving the chamber for a few minutes.\n\nSome senators got up and stood in the back of the chamber. At one point, Gillibrand went to the back of the chamber, took off her black high-heels and took a deep sigh before returning to her desk and wrapping herself with a red blanket. Sen. Tom Cotton resorted to holding up a stack of papers to hide his yawns.\n\n-Christal Hayes and Savannah Behrmann\n\nSchumer introduces sixth amendment\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced his sixth amendment, a measure that would subpoena testimony from Robert Blair, an assistant to the president and adviser to White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Michael Duffey, a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBoth are officials that the House attempted to question during the impeachment inquiry, but were blocked from appearing by the administration.\n\nThe Senate has already rejected five subpoena requests from Schumer on party-line votes of 53 to 47.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nDemocrats’ fifth attempt to call witnesses and documents fails\n\nThe Senate voted 53-47 to table Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s amendment that would have subpoenaed documents relevant to the allegations against Trump from the Pentagon.\n\nDemocrats had advocated for the amendment as a necessary part of the case against Trump because of the Pentagon’s failure to comply with the impeachment inquiry.\n\n“The Senate has an opportunity to obtain and review the full record that could fully demonstrate how and why the president was holding the aid,” Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., an Army veteran and one of the House impeachment managers said in remarks supporting the amendment.\n\nPatrick Philbin, deputy counsel to the president, said the reason the Pentagon had not complied with the inquiry was because the inquiry itself was \"unlawful.\"\n\n\"It was unlawful and that's why no documents were produced,\" Philbin said.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nDonald Trump impeachment trial could continue late into the night\n\nThe Senate briefly halted proceedings to take a quorum call, or what is basically a roll call of senators, in order to give Senate Republican and Democratic leaders time to negotiate over proceedings.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had suggested Democrats bundle their amendments together for a single vote, rather than the sequence of debates and votes that have happened so far.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, disagreed.\n\n\"We will not back off on getting votes on all of these amendments, which we regard as extremely significant and important to the country,\" he said on the Senate floor.\n\n\"We are willing to do some of those tomorrow,\" he acknowledged. \"There is no reason we have to do them all tonight and inconvenience the Senate and Chief Justice.\"\n\nWhen the Senate finished its quorum call, though, the trial continued with the introduction of Schumer's amendment to subpoena Pentagon records, and it seemed no deal had been reached between senators.\n\nSenate votes down Democrats' fourth attempt to subpoena witnesses and documents\n\nIn a party-line, 53-47 vote, the Senate voted down Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s amendment to subpoena acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nDemocrats sought his testimony as someone with “firsthand knowledge” of the campaign to pressure Ukraine into opening politically motivated investigations.\n\n“Mr. Mulvaney was in the loop at each critical stage of President Trump’s scheme,” Jeffries said.\n\n“The subject of this amendment should appear before the Senate if we’re going to have a free and fair trial,” Jeffries argued.\n\nMulvaney had acknowledged Trump had held up military assistance to Ukraine to pressure the country, before walking back his comments.\n\n\"We do that all that time with foreign policy,” Mulvaney had said at a press briefing in October 2019.\n\nRepublicans countered by saying the president did nothing wrong.\n\nMichael Purpura, one of the president’s lawyers, said: “this chamber’s role is not to do the House’s job for it.”\n\n“There wasn’t any” quid pro quo, said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\n“Only in DC would someone say it’s wrong to not spend taxpayer dollars fast enough, even if it was on time,” Cipollone quipped.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nTed Cruz thinks Trump's impeachment trial will end with an acquittal\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the basement of the Capitol, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX., said he didn’t “think we're going to see a dismissal, and I think a dismissal is not nearly as good an outcome for the president and for the country as will be a final judgment on the merits.”\n\n“I think the judgment here is not going to be a dismissal but rather on acquittal on the merits at the end of both sides having an opportunity to present their case,” he continued.\n\nHe criticized Democrats for disagreeing “with the president politically\" but not \"satisfying the constitutional standard\" to remove him.\n\n“If you have the facts, you bang the facts. If you have the law, you bang the law. If you don't have either, you bang the table. Well, this afternoon we've seen a whole lot of table banging,” Cruz continued during his condemnation of Democrats.\n\nKlobuchar talks about running for president during an impeachment trial\n\n2020 Democratic candidate and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar spoke about her GOP colleagues, saying that during the trial she \"keeps looking\" at them \"to see if they look guilty, and some of them are kind of looking down.”\n\n“I don't know how they can deny all witnesses. Let's see what they do after a few days of this but I think that the House Managers made a very effective case for the fact that we have evidence, and we need to listen to evidence, and we need to listen to witnesses. You can’t have a trial with zero witnesses and zero documents. That is not how this works,” she said.\n\nShe also touched on juggling the 2020 campaign with the Iowa Caucus approaching with serving as a Senator.\n\n“That's always been my plan, we were prepared for this,\" she said. \"That's why my husband and daughter are there right now. But, I have a constitutional duty and so whatever the president's lawyers want to say, and poke at us for simply doing our jobs and being here, and act like it's some kind of political disadvantage, I think the people of this country understand it,” she continued. “The people in these early states are going to understand that I have to do my job.”\n\nTrump being 'constantly updated,' Ueland says\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump is away at Davos, he is being \"constantly updated\" of events in the impeachment trial, White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters during a break in proceedings.\"\n\nTrump was \"very impressed\" by how his defense team was handling themselves, Ueland added.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchumer proposes to subpoena Mulvaney\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed Tuesday to subpoena acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate recessed for dinner until 8 p.m. before debating the proposal.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said there could be votes to subpoena witnesses and documents after opening arguments by the House managers prosecuting the case and Trump’s defense lawyers.\n\nThe Senate has already rejected three subpoena requests from Schumer on party-line votes of 53 to 47.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSenate again rejects subpoena for budget documents\n\nThe Senate voted 53 to 47 to reject a proposed subpoena Tuesday for budget documents about Ukraine military aid for the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe defeat was the third party-line vote to reject proposals from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. But the Senate could vote again after hearing opening arguments from House managers prosecuting the case and Trump’s defense lawyers.\n\nOne manager, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., said withholding the $391 million in military aid was personal to him after he served as an Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n“When we talk about troops not getting the equipment they need when they need it, it’s personal to me,” Crow said. “Real people’s lives are at stake.”\n\nHe noted that 87 senators voted to provide the funding. Office of Management and Budget documents could help explain how and why the money was held, he said.\n\n“It’s clear the president is trying to hide this evidence because he knows what they would show,” Crow said.\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s private lawyers, quoted Ukraine officials saying that the suspension was short enough that they didn’t notice the lack of funding. He noted that the aid was released Sept. 11 without Ukraine announcing investigations that Trump requested.\n\nSekulow argued that U.S. policy toward Ukraine strengthened with the security aid, rather than just humanitarian assistance.\n\n“This president has been concerned about how aid has been put forward,” Sekulow said.\n\nAnother manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., noted that the Government Accountability Office found the suspension of funding violated the law and the money was released after Congress asked about it.\n\n“Yes, they got the money after the president got caught,” Schiff said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchumer proposes subpoena for budget documents\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed a third amendment Tuesday to rules for the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate has already rejected his two earlier proposals on party-line votes to subpoena documents from the White House and the State Department.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget defied a House subpoena for documents about withholding $391 million in military aid from Ukraine.\n\nThe online publication Just Security published emails from Michael Duffey, an associate director OMB, said that said there was “Clear direction from POTUS to continue the hold,” referring to the president of the United States. But Schumer sought more documents to explain how the money was suspended and whether there were concerns about it.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office reported that the hold on the money violated federal law because the Trump administration withheld the money for policy reasons rather than programmatic reasons.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nSenate rejects subpoena for State Department documents\n\nThe Senate voted 53 to 47 Tuesday to reject a proposal to subpoena State Department documents about Ukraine for President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed to subpoena department documents to overcome the administration’s stonewalling. The House impeached Trump for accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival.\n\nBut White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House on Oct. 8 that the administration would defy subpoenas from what he called an illegitimate inquiry.\n\nDemocrats continue to seek documents about a series of four calls March 27 from Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to the State Department switchboard. The calls came at a time when Giuliani was organizing a campaign to remove Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAnother document Democrats seek is a cable that William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to describe concerns about withholding $391 million in military aid from Ukraine.\n\n“The State Department has not produced a single document in response to the congressional subpoena,” said Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., one of the managers prosecuting the president.\n\nBut the Senate voted against issuing a subpoena. Another vote could come after House managers and Trump’s defense lawyers make their opening arguments and senators pose written questions to them.\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s defense lawyers, said courts have long recognized executive privilege to protect the confidentiality of communications with the president. Sekulow argued that the privilege also applied to communications between the president’s aides, as they formulate advice.\n\nSekulow called it “a dangerous moment for America” if Trump couldn’t assert executive privilege and defend the claim in federal court.\n\n“The Constitution allows it, if necessary,” Sekulow said. “The Constitution demands it, if necessary.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nWhat's it like inside the Senate trial?\n\nSenators Ben Sasse, R-NE., and David Perdue, R-GA., sometimes whispered back and forth, resulting in quiet chuckles, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., handed Sen. Warner, D-VA., what appeared to be a cough drop or a piece of candy.\n\nSusan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, two Republican senators who are considered to be moderates of their party and potential key voters during the trial, sat intently when listening to House Manager Rep. Zoe Lofgren. When White House legal counsel Patrick Philbin stood up to rebuke, both GOP senators sat up and began to scribble notes.\n\nUtah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, who has been critical of Trump in the past, sat mostly still when listening to Trump lawyers, at one point raising his eyebrows when one of them argued their view of the use of executive privilege.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave his GOP colleagues a glance when Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., asked the Senate, “We are ready to present our case, we are ready to call witnesses. The question is: will you let us?”\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, patted the backs of fellow legal team members as they filed out of the chamber for recess.\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nSleepy senator?\n\nSen. Jim Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was the first senator who appeared to doze off during the hours-long debate.\n\nRisch, R-Idaho, who was slouched back in his chair on the Senate floor, cradled his head in hand and shut his eyes as Rep. Demings argued that the chamber should subpoena the State Department for documents regarding Ukraine.\n\nRisch perked up and opened his eyes when House managers played a video of testimony given by Gordan Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. After looking up for a moment, Risch put his head back down and shut his eyes.\n\nThe feverish notetaking by senators slowed down as proceedings – and evening – wore on. Some fiddled with pens and eyeglasses or sipped from water glasses on their desk. Others sat with their arms crossed or leaned back further in their chairs.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nDemings becomes first African American impeachment trial manager\n\nRep. Val Demings, D-Fla., became the first African American to serve as an impeachment trial manager when she spoke in favor of a Democratic resolution today that would subpoena all relevant State Department documents.\n\nDemings is one of three women on the seven-person group of House impeachment managers, who serve a role akin to prosecutors. Two of the managers are members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and one is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nThe 13 Republican impeachment managers appointed for President Bill Clinton’s trial were all white men. Cheryl Mills, an African American woman, defended Clinton during his trial.\n\nDemings argued the documents Democrats sought could shed additional light on the alleged scheme to pressure the Ukrainian government into opening politically motivated investigations. The White House failed to comply with many of the congressionally issued subpoenas during the impeachment inquiry, so the documents needed to be called during the Senate trial, Demings said.\n\n“The president sought to conceal evidence of misconduct,” Demings said on the Senate floor. “He did so by ordering his entire administration, every office, every agency, every official, to defy every subpoena that was served in the House impeachment inquiry. No president in history has ever done anything like this.”\n\nSchumer introduces a second amendment\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a second amendment to the rules that would subpoena all relevant State Department documents.\n\nIt calls for all documents from Jan. 1, 2019 until the present, including President Donald Trump’s communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy, top State Department officials’ communications with Ukrainian officials about potential investigations, and communications regarding U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch’s removal as ambassador.\n\nA similar amendment to subpoena all relevant White House documents was voted down on a party-line vote\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nFirst vote of the Trump impeachment trial goes against Democrats\n\nBy a 53-47 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to table Schumer’s amendment, which would change the organizing rules for the trial to subpoena all documents from the White House relevant to Democrats’ allegations against Trump.\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats’ call for more documents meant they were bringing a factually deficient case to trial, while Democrats highlighted the White House’s prior failure to comply with congressionally issued subpoenas.\n\n-Nicholas Wu\n\nRep. Lofgren makes impeachment history\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren became the first female house manager to offer an argument on the Senate floor as part of a president’s trial.\n\nLofgren, D-Calif., is one of three women on the seven-member team of house managers. The impeachment trials of Presidents Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson featured an all-male team of house managers.\n\nLofgren offered arguments on behalf of Democrats on why the Senate should approve an amendment that would subpoena a number of key documents regarding Ukraine. The documents were among those that Democrats have been after for months but were blocked from being released by the administration.\n\n“The Senate should act on this subpoena now at the outside of the trial,” she argued, explaining it was “common sense” to request such information now, rather than at the end of the trial after both sides have made their arguments.\n\n“We don't know with certainty what the documents will say. We simply want the truth, whatever that truth may be,” Lofgren said. “So do the American people. They want to know the truth.”\n\nShe concluded, explaining that how this trial is remembered will be up to senators. “History is watching.”\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\n\"It pains me\": Jeff Flake spotted watching the trial unfold\n\nFormer Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was among the spectators in the balcony watching today's impeachment trial proceedings. Flake sat in the front row of the balcony ringing the Senate floor, silently observing the proceedings unfold.\n\nOn his way out of the Capitol, he told USA TODAY he was \"just in town and thought I'd take a look.\"\n\n\"They're taking it seriously,\" he said of his former senatorial colleagues, noting how rare it was to see the Senate with \"all there, all quiet.\"\n\nFlake called the proceedings a \"very solemn thing,\" but was unsure if he would vote to impeach the president if he were still a senator.\n\n\"You can make a compelling argument on both sides,\" he said of whether Trump's conduct merited impeachment, but added, \"what you can't do is argue the president did nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"I've always said I would like to see the voters remove the president,\" he said.\n\n\"It pains me,\" he said, to hear House Republicans insist Trump did nothing wrong with Ukraine.\n\nAsked whether he thought proceedings were fair, Flake replied, \"fairness is what the Senate decides.\"\n\nFlake said he had talked to \"a number of senators\" about the current proceedings but declined to elaborate on which members or about what.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nSchumer seeks to subpoena White House records\n\nSchumer introduced the first of what could be several amendments to the resolution setting up the rules for the trial.\n\nSchumer’s amendment would subpoena all White House records related to Democrats’ allegations against Trump, including National Security Council records, conversations about Ukraine, and the delay in military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nSenate Republicans have indicated they wanted to vote on subpoenaing witnesses and documents after the first phase of the trial.\n\n\"If any amendments are brought forward to force premature decisions on mid-trial questions, I will move to table such amendments and protect our bipartisan precedent,\" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor earlier.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nWhite House lawyers attack case as threat to the republic\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s defense team blasted the impeachment case against him as a \"ridiculous\" and \"outrageous\" threat to the republic, rather than debate the trial rules they supported.\n\nIn a wide-ranging pair of speeches on the Senate floor, private lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused Democrats in bracing language of seeking to remove Trump since he was elected.\n\nSekulow said Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., committed a “trifecta” of improprieties by denying Trump access to evidence, counsel access at hearings and the right to cross-examine witnesses during the House inquiry.\n\n“That’s a trifecta, a trifecta that violates the Constitution of the United States,” Sekulow said.\n\nHouse Democrats on three committees held closed-door depositions during the inquiry, but Republicans were allowed to attend and ask questions. The Judiciary Committee then invited Trump's lawyers to attend and participate in hearings by questioning witnesses, but the White House declined to participate in what Cipollone called a \"baseless and highly partisan\" inquiry.\n\nCipollone called the impeachment dangerous to the republic for seeking to remove the president elected in 2016 and block him from the ballot in the 2020 election.\n\n“A partisan impeachment is like stealing an election,” Cipollone told senators. “It’s a partisan impeachment that they delivered to your doorstep.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff: Trump “corrupt” even if dressed in “gaudy legal clothing”\n\nThe lead House manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., outlined the case against Trump while arguing the Senate needs to subpoena more witnesses and documents in order to conduct a fair trial.\n\nSchiff said the articles accusing Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress describe misconduct that “is the most serious ever charged against a president.”\n\nThe abuse of power came when Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, “to help him cheat in the next U.S. presidential election,” Schiff said. The request came as Trump withheld $391 million in military aid that Ukraine needed in its fight against Russia, Schiff said.\n\n“Astonishingly, the president’s trial brief, filed yesterday, contends that even if this conduct is proved, that there is nothing the House or this Senate may do about it,” Schiff said. “It is the president’s apparent belief that under Article II he can do whatever he wants, no matter how corrupt, outfitted in gaudy legal clothing.”\n\nThe charge of obstruction resulted from Trump directing his administration to defy congressional subpoenas while investigating the misconduct, Schiff said.\n\n“This is every bit as destructive of our constitutional order as the misconduct charged in the first article,” Schiff said. “It makes him a monarch, the very evil against which our Constitution and the balance of powers it carefully laid out, was designed to guard against.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff: 'Process makes no sense'\n\nThe lead House impeacment manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told senators that their vote on the rules would be more important than their eventual vote on whether to convict or acquit Trump.\n\nSchiff said a fair trial would depend on whether to subpoena witnesses or documents, or introduce evidence already gathered. He opposed McConnell’s proposal, saying it would conduct the trial backwards, with arguments first and evidence at the end.\n\n“That process makes no sense,” Schiff said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\n'President has done nothing wrong'\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone supported McConnell’s rules package, saying that it would provide a fair process for the president to defend himself.\n\n“The president has done absolutely nothing wrong,” Cipollone said. “It is long past time to start this proceeding and we are here today to do it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff plays videos of Trump\n\nThe Senate reacted sedately as Democratic impeachment managers played video and audio of Trump saying he \"would love\" for senior administration officials like acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to testify.\n\nUnlike the more raucous proceedings in the House, when Republicans would vocally voice their disapproval of Democrats' arguments by booing Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, senators quietly took notes, intently listening to Schiff's arguments.\n\nSenate rules prohibit side conversations and enforce a quiet debate \"on pain of imprisonment.\"\n\n- Christal Hayes and Nicholas Wu\n\nRoberts is not wearing Rehnquist's stripes\n\nThe last time the Senate conducted a president's impeachment trial in 1999, Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided. And Americans immediately were struck by his fashion statement: four gold stripes on each arm.\n\nWas it a special impeachment flourish? Nope. Rehnquist added the stripes four years earlier, in January 1995, in a whimsical emulation of Lord Chancellor in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera \"Iolanthe.\"\n\nThe chief justice went right on wearing those stripes for the remainder of his tenure, until his death in 2005 – both on the bench and during his public appearances, including when he delivered the oath of office at presidential inaugurations.\n\nRoberts, who succeeded Rehnquist and is in his 15th term as chief justice, has never adorned his robe with any accoutrements. The trial of Trump will be no exception.\n\n- Richard Wolf\n\nPublic packing balcony at trial\n\nMembers of the public packed the balcony overlooking the chamber, including actress and activist Alyssa Milano, who sat in the front row, listening intently.\n\nAs senators took their seat, they were greeted by staff passing out the trial briefs filed by both House managers and the White House. Many senators brought along notebooks.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., came prepared with a stack of sticky notes at the ready on his desk, along with dividers.\n\nRepublican senators warmly greeted Trump's defense team, many smiling and shaking hands or patting members of the group on the back. The team sat prepared with stacks of books and binders, including one with the White House logo that was labeled simply: \"Impeachment.\"\n\nDemocratic senators similarly shook hands and exchanged words with House managers before the trial got underway.\n\nThe two opposing panels sat at curved black tables, with glasses of water.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nSchumer: McConnell wants 'rushed' trial\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Tuesday he will propose changes to Republicans' proposed rules for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.\n\n“Leader McConnell wants the process rushed with as little evidence as possible in the dark of night,” Schumer said.\n\nSchumer said the first amendment will seek to subpoena White House documents that deal with withholding $391 million in military aid for Ukraine. Democrats impeached Trump for withholding the money in order to allegedly pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nA series of Schumer amendment proposals will deal with other documents and witnesses. Schumer has called for testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\n“It cannot be overstated how serious this charge is,” Schumer said. “If foreigners can interfere in our elections and determine the outcome instead of the American people determining the outcome, our democracy is vastly eroding.”\n\nWhat to expect Tuesday: What is planned to take place as the Senate trial resumes\n\nSchumer acknowledged the difficulty he faces in changing McConnell’s proposal. A 51-vote majority will set the rules in the chamber, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority over Democrats.\n\n“We need four Republicans who are willing to stand up for what’s right, who are willing to stand up for what America wants and needs, and not simply bow down to the president,” Schumer said.\n\nSchumer also accused McConnell of working with the White House on the resolution, saying it appeared the resolution was written in the White House, not the U.S. Capitol. He said it was a \"blueprint for an impeachment trial on fast-forward.\"\n\nThe Senate will resume its impeachment trial of the president at 1 p.m.\n\n- Bart Jansen and Christal Hayes\n\nRomney: late trial hours 'a nothing issue'\n\nRepublican senators decried Democratic objections to McConnell's proposed impeachment trial rules,saying they did not believe that Democratic amendments would garner any support from the conference.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah and a key potential swing vote in the chamber, said the objections over arguments being heard over two days – possibly leaving the trial in session into the early morning hours – was “kind of a nothing issue.\" He explained that the media will cover the trial “whether it happens at 2 a.m. or 2 in the afternoon” and that most people would not watch the trial in its entirety but rather would watch short clips of the events.\n\n“Our Democratic friends, I think, have failed to learn the lesson that if you call everything outrageous, then nothing is outrageous,” Romney said. “And whether it's two days or four days, we have the time to review what is presented because we have the full 24 hours.”\n\nRepublicans pushed back on the notion that the American people would not be awake for key parts of the president’s trial. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said the time difference would help those along the West Coast watch the proceedings. “It’s prime time for the West Coast,” he said.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nSchiff slams McConnell's proposed trial rules\n\nHouse managers who will prosecute the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump blasted the proposed Senate rules for how the trial will be conducted as “rigged,\" just hours before the trial resumes Tuesday.\n\nThe lead manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said requiring votes to admit evidence the House has collected, and to determine whether to subpoena witnesses or documents, is a recipe for hiding evidence from the American people.\n\nSchiff also said compressing arguments into 12-hour days that begin at 1 p.m., as proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would discourage people from watching the trial. Schiff said the argument time was expanded from six-hour days during the 1999 trial of former President Bill Clinton.\n\n“This is not a process for a fair trial. This is the process for a rigged trial,” Schiff told reporters at a news conference. “This is the process for if you do not want the American people to see the evidence.”\n\n‘Sham’? 'Rule of law’?: How the House debate set the stage for the impeachment trial\n\nAs an example, Schiff cited text messages between top diplomats questioning Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, which are at the heart of his impeachment. Schiff also said it is important to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who each declined invitations to testify during the House inquiry.\n\n“It will not prove the president innocent,” Schiff said of blocking their testimony. “It will mere prove the Senate guilty of working with the president to obstruct the truth from coming out.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrent Lott and Tom Daschle: Senate leaders from Clinton's impeachment trial say two sides must work together\n\nFor Senators: No gabbing, no milling\n\nNo cell phones. No talking out of turn. And stay at your desks.\n\nAnd bathroom breaks? They’re allowed but only through the adjoining cloakroom.\n\nDuring the impeachment trial, senators accustomed to moving about the chamber, chatting with colleagues and checking their phones will have to get used to decorum not unlike those practiced in a strictly run classroom. Even if the stakes are a little higher.\n\nHere are some of the rules that must be followed during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump:\n\nSenators should attend as much of the proceedings as they can.\n\nSenators will only have limited opportunities to speak. And they should refrain from conversing with other senators while the case is being presented.\n\nSenators can only read materials related to the matter before the Senate.\n\nNo use of phones or electronic devices are permitted in the chamber during the proceedings.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., stopped by the press pen outside the chamber to do an impression of \"Gollum\" from Lord of the Rings to demonstrate how senators feel when they get their phones back during recess, acting out: “Oh my precious!”\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nPoll: majority of Americans say evidence should be allowed\n\nA new poll found that a majority of Americans say introducing new evidence should be allowed in the impeachment trial.\n\nIn a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday before the trial, 57% of respondents said House managers should be able to present new evidence. Thirty-seven percent said they should be limited to evidence that was revealed as part of the impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\n- Jeanine Santucci\n\nDebate on rules to begin at 1 p.m. EST\n\nAfter House Democrats and Trump's legal team traded written jabs over the weekend, the Senate will resume its impeachment trial of the president at 1 p.m. Tuesday with a contentious debate about the rules for conducting the proceeding.\n\nMcConnell proposed allocating 24 hours to each side to present their case over two session days for each side. With sessions expected to start at 1 p.m. daily, Democrats assailed the proposal for having the trial run late into the night.\n\nAfter opening arguments, senators would have 16 hours to pose written questions to both sides through Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial.\n\nBut the Senate wouldn't automatically accept the House evidence gathered so far. Under McConnell's proposal, four hours of debate over whether to subpoena witnesses or documents would come after the opening arguments and questions.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the proposal a \"national disgrace\" and said he would offer amendments.\n\n“Under this resolution, Sen. McConnell is saying he doesn’t want to hear any of the existing evidence, and he doesn’t want to hear any new evidence,\" Schumer said.\n\nWho are the managers?: Who are the 7 impeachment managers selected for the Senate trial of President Donald Trump?\n\nThe seven House managers who will prosecute the case issued a joint statement calling McConnell’s proposal “an effort to prevent the full truth of the president’s conduct from coming to light.” The managers said it could become the first trial in history without House witnesses and documents.\n\n“That is not a fair trial. In fact, it is no trial at all,” said the managers: Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Jerry Nadler and Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Jason Crow of Colorado and Sylvia Garcia of Texas. “A White House-driven and rigged process, with a truncated schedule designed to go late into the night and further conceal the President’s misconduct, is not what the American people expect or deserve.”\n\nThe Constitution sets few requirements for a Senate trial, so senators must still decide basic rules such as to when the trial will be conducted each day and how long each side will have to speak. The set of rules is called an organizing resolution.\n\nA 51-vote majority of senators will set the rules – both at the beginning of the trial and whether to call witnesses – in a chamber with 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats.\n\nTrump will spend the opening two days of the trial at an economic conference in Davos, Switzerland. \"He has a full day here in Davos, but will be briefed by staff periodically,\" said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nWhite House lawyer could be disqualified, Dems say\n\nHouse managers who are prosecuting the case against Trump suggested Tuesday that the president’s top defense lawyer, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, could be disqualified from the trial because of his first-hand knowledge about the case.\n\nThe managers sent a five-page letter to Cipollone saying he could be a witness and should disclose any facts and information before making legal arguments on Trump’s behalf in the trial. The managers said the disclosure is important so that senators and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could be aware of any ethics issues, conflicts or biases.\n\n“These risks are so serious that they can require a lawyer’s disqualification,” the letter said.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Tuesday that Cipollone should be recused from the trial because of he was a “fact witness.”\n\n“Yes, he should,” Nadler said when asked if Cipollone should recuse himself.\n\nCipollone is a “fact witness,” Nadler added, and “one of the participants in what we’ve accused the president of.”\n\nWhat is a manager?: What is an impeachment manager, and what do they do?\n\nManagers focused on information that Cipollone had about concerns about Ukraine that several officials raised to the top lawyer at the National Security Council, John Eisenberg. Fiona Hill, a former NSC aide, said Eisenberg became “very concerned” when he learned that Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was involved. Other NSC staffers – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Tim Morrison – also reported concerns to Eisenberg about Trump’s July 25 call to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe call is at the heart of the impeachment accusations against Trump, which accuse him of pressuring Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n“In light of your extensive knowledge of these key events, your personal representation of President Trump threatens to undermine the integrity of the pending trial,” the managers said in the letter.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley pushed back on the request of Cipollone.\n\n“The Democrats are an utter joke - they have no case, and this latest political stunt proves it,\" he said. \"The idea that the Counsel to the President has to turn over protected documents and confidential information is ludicrous, and to imply he can’t represent the President of the United States in an impeachment proceeding is completely absurd.”\n\n- Bart Jansen, Nicholas Wu and David Jackson\n\nWill witnesses and documents be permitted?\n\nWhatever logistics are set for arguments, one of most contentious issues is whether the Senate will subpoena witnesses and documents, to gather additional evidence. But the final answer to that question isn't expected Tuesday.\n\nSchumer has proposed issuing subpoenas for four witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and three batches of documents.\n\nBut McConnell has said he has the votes to postpone that decision until after opening arguments and written questions. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggested that if Democrats are allowed to call their witnesses, Republicans will call witnesses such as Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who worked at a Ukraine gas company.\n\nThe articles of impeachment accuse Trump of abuse of power for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, while withholding $391 million in military aid. The articles also accuse Trump of obstruction of Congress because the White House then directed aides and agencies to defy subpoenas for testimony and documents during the inquiry.\n\nOnce the organizing resolution is adopted, the arguments about the evidence begins. House managers and Trump's legal team offered a sample of their arguments over the weekend, in written briefs.\n\nHouse Democrats said there was \"overwhelming\" evidence against Trump and said he was a danger to the country's national security.\n\n\"President Trump’s misconduct presents a danger to our democratic processes, our national security, and our commitment to the rule of law. He must be removed from office,\" the seven House managers wrote in a 111-page filing summarizing their opening arguments for the trial.\n\nTrump's legal team, meanwhile, called the House impeachment drive \"a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election – now just months away.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers said the articles \"do not identify any impeachable offense\" and that the inquiry was \"irredeemably flawed.\"\n\n\"All that House Democrats have succeeded in proving is that the President did absolutely nothing wrong,\" the filing said.\n\n- Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/30/animatronic-groundhog-coalfield-crayfish-old-bay-sauce-news-around-states/41109713/", "title": "Animatronic groundhog, coalfield crayfish: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nJan. 30, 2020, 2:54 a.m. ET\n\nAlabama\n\nAtmore: The state is largely shutting down a state prison that houses more than 600 inmates because of sewer and other infrastructure problems in the 51-year-old facility, the state commissioner announced Wednesday. The move is the latest upheaval in the prison system that has struggled with overcrowding, low staffing, violence and aging facilities. Alabama Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn said 617 inmates at Holman Correctional Facility at Atmore will be sent to other state prisons. Dunn said the decision was made because maintenance crews were struggling daily to maintain sewer and electrical systems housed in a tunnel running beneath the main prison building. Some inmates, including death row inmates, will remain at Holman in units that run on separate systems, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The population of endangered beluga whales in Alaska’s Cook Inlet continues to decline, federal marine mammal authorities announced Tuesday. A biennial survey conducted by the fisheries arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated the population of the white whales at 250 to 317, with a median estimate of 279. “The population is estimated to be smaller and declining more quickly than previously thought,” NOAA Fisheries said in the announcement. The survey is based on data collected by aerial surveys in summer 2018. The survey also documented that a contraction has persisted of the summer range of belugas, the geographical area where they live. Since 2008, on average 81% of the total population occupied the Susitna Delta near the north end of the inlet in early June during the aerial survey period. Before that, about 50% did.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: If you want to tie the knot at the Grand Canyon, you’ll want to get your request in sooner rather than later. A lack of staffing means applications for special use permits will take longer to process, park officials said this week. Weddings, family reunions, memorial services, organized group hikes or runs within the canyon, and scattering ashes within the park all require special use permits. The most popular request is to say “I do” at Shoshone Point at the South Rim, the only viewpoint available for outdoor receptions, or at a multipurpose building known as Shrine of the Ages, said Sharon Ringsven, the park’s deputy chief of commercial services. Other wedding locations are available within the park. Basic permits now take up to 30 days to process but will take up to 45 days starting Feb. 14. More complex requests could take up to 90 days.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit trying to block from this year’s ballot a referendum on a new law expanding the procedures that optometrists can perform. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen dismissed the lawsuit by Arkansans for Healthy Eyes, a group formed in opposition to the referendum effort. The lawsuit claimed the referendum wasn’t approved under the correct process. The new law allows optometrists to perform several procedures that previously only ophthalmologists could perform, including injections around the eye, the removal of lesions from the eyelids and certain laser eye surgeries. The law’s supporters say optometrists are already trained to perform the procedures but were being forced to refer patients elsewhere. It has drawn heavy opposition from ophthalmologists who say the change puts patients at risk.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A top public official and go-to bureaucrat to mayors over two decades was charged with public corruption Tuesday, upending City Hall as elected leaders scrambled to reassure the public that bribery and kickbacks would not be tolerated. The complaint unsealed against San Francisco Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru and longtime restaurateur Nick Bovis focuses on an aborted attempt in 2018 to bribe a San Francisco airport commissioner for retail space. It also alleges other schemes in which Nuru is accused of trying to help his friend score contracts to build homeless shelters and portable toilets, along with a restaurant at the city’s new $2 billion transit station. Nuru is also accused of accepting free labor at his vacation home and a John Deere tractor as well as lavish gifts from a developer, including a $2,070 bottle of wine.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state audit found Colorado may be losing significant tax revenue due to oil and gas companies failing to submit thousands of monthly reports used to track how much energy they produce. The audit estimated the energy producers operating in the state would have been subject to “about $308 million in penalties for delinquent reports,” Colorado Public Radio reports. Regulators are not imposing penalties or tracking missing or incomplete production reports, the audit found. The reports help the state determine whether the companies have paid the correct tax amounts. The audit said 10% of operators also filed reports with missing information. “It was distressing to see that there was a culture of acceptance of not filing forms,” said Rep. Dafna Michaelsen Jenet, the Democratic vice chair of the committee. “And the top producers are the biggest violators, and we’re talking about thousands upon thousands of forms not filed. ”\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The city is asking police to enforce a youth curfew following a shooting outside a courthouse that left four people in the hospital. Bridgeport Police Chief Armando Perez said Tuesday that the department increased patrols across the city immediately after the shooting. The victims were sitting in a car outside Bridgeport Superior Court on Monday afternoon when someone in a passing SUV opened fire, police said. City officials said the shooting was not random, and the four people were targeted. They were all taken to the hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening. The youth curfew, based on an ordinance passed and enforced in 2012, will be enforced from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight to 6 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Mayor Joe Ganim said it is up to police whether they will issue a $50 fine or order community service for curfew violations.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Reunited rockers Rage Against the Machine and Grammy record-setter Billie Eilish will lead a high-powered 2020 lineup for Firefly Music Festival on the first weekend of the summer. The festival, entering its ninth year in the city, revealed the lineup – which also includes Halsey, Khalid, Blink 182 and Maggie Rogers as headliners – on Tuesday morning. The three acts that will close Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights on the main stage are Rage, Eilish and Halsey, officials said. Presale tickets will go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. at fireflyfestival.com. Fans must first go to the site and register for a unique access code to the sale. Four-day general admission passes start at $299, VIP at $699 and Super VIP at $2,499. Tickets will open to the general public Monday. Once the $299 general admission tickets are sold out, they will increase in price by $20 increments each time a new batch sells out, topping out at $359 each.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local leaders have vowed not to support a former councilman who filed papers to run for the seat he vacated less than two weeks ago amid ethics violation allegations. Jack Evans filed paperwork Monday to seek reelection to the D.C. Council, news outlets report. Evans resigned Jan. 17, shortly before councilors were set to vote on his expulsion. An investigation found he used his position to benefit private clients and failed to recognize their payments as conflicts of interest. “I cannot support him coming back,” council Chairman Phil Mendelson said Tuesday. Evans has also been the subject of a federal investigation, according to news outlets. He’s denied any wrongdoing. “We should all call on Jack to do not what’s best for Jack but what’s best for the District of Columbia,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. A special election to fill Evans’ former Ward 2 seat has been scheduled for June.\n\nFlorida\n\nSanford: Inmates are sewing cloth pouches for kangaroos and koalas orphaned by wildfires in Australia, even if animal care organizations there have enough of them for the time being. The Seminole County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday tweeted video showing two inmates hard at work at sewing machines, stitching together what are called “joey pouches” for the orphaned marsupials. The pouches are made from old uniforms. “Inmates making them learn a new skill they can use upon their release,” tweeted the sheriff’s office, located outside Orlando. Australia’s unprecedented wildfire season has charred huge expanses of brushland, rainforests and national parks – killing more than a billion wild animals by one estimate. People hoping to help out from afar have been sewing pouches and sending them to Australia – so many that earlier this month, an organization distributing the pouches said it was being “overwhelmed.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Terrapin Beer Co. has installed solar panels and aims to reduce its energy consumption by 30%. The Athens-based brewery recently cut the ribbon on the project, which involves 720 solar panels on Terrapin’s roof and on its parking lot’s sunshades. “At Terrapin, we want to be bigger than beer,” Terrapin president Dustin Watts said. “That is our main focus and goal. ... Beer brings people together, and, with that beverage, if we can inspire people to do good or do better things for the planet and for human beings in general, that’s our main goal.” The solar panel array is part of Terrapin’s larger sustainability campaign called Terraprint. There’s now a TV screen in the tap room that shows customers how much solar energy is being used at any given time.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Fewer sea turtles were found stranded on Maui last year than in 2018, although officials say most cases continue to be caused by fishing gear. There were 141 documented cases of green sea turtles stranded on Maui last year, down from 174 in 2018, The Maui News reports. Among the stranded turtles reported in 2019, 117 were located alive. Fishing gear caused 102 strandings, and 13 were stranded due to unknown causes. The remaining 26 were caused by boat strikes, buoyancy disorders, injured flippers, shark bites, diseases, or turtles becoming stuck in rocks or sand, officials said. The Maui Ocean Center Marine Institute said fishermen are encouraged to help turtles by removing hooks and lines. The institute is the nonprofit arm of the Maui Ocean Center aquarium that coordinates responses to sick, injured, distressed or expired sea turtles on Maui.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s top wildlife official on Tuesday requested authorization from lawmakers to spend $408,000 to count wolves. Department of Fish and Game Director Ed Schriever told the Legislature’s budget-setting committee that the expense would become part of the agency’s annual budget to keep a running tally of the number of wolves in the state. Idaho stopped counting wolves in 2015 after it was no longer required to do so by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service following the lifting of protections for wolves under the Endangered Species Act. In April, Schriever cobbled together existing efforts to count wolves, and last week he announced there are 1,000 wolves in Idaho based on information from 600 cameras scattered around the state. The population had been closer to 1,500 early in the summer of 2019 but was reduced through hunting, trapping and killing of wolves that preyed on livestock.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Old St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church will no longer host its World’s Largest Block Party, the church announced on its website Tuesday. The 35-year-old, two-day festival of music and food drew thousands of people to a street west of Chicago’s business district. Old St. Patrick’s pastor, the Rev. Tom Hurley, said in the letter that the summer event environment in Chicago is more competitive than it was 35 years ago and more difficult for the 175-year-old church to navigate. “We are grateful for where we have been and we are excited as we look to the future and starting to plan events, experiences and programs that reflect where we are going,” Hurley wrote. In the block party’s place, the church on March 14 will host what Hurley calls a “Shamrock’n the Block” party to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day. Old St. Patrick’s used proceeds from the World’s Largest Block Party to fund its social justice initiatives.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: State officials have put the Gary Community School Corp. on notice for violating Indiana law by offering enrollment incentives last fall. The district posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram offering $25 Visa gift cards to parents who referred students to successfully enroll in Gary schools, Northwest Indiana Times reports. The posts said those students also would be entered in a raffle to receive an iPad. Indiana law explicitly prohibits any public, charter or private schools who receive state scholarship funding from offering incentives in the form “of any item that has monetary value, including cash or a gift card.” The incentive offer was posted online with a Sept. 13 deadline – the same day all Indiana districts were required to submit student enrollment totals to the Department of Education for verification. State school funding is directly tied to student enrollment.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will for the first time have two women on its Supreme Court after Gov. Kim Reynolds on Tuesday named an eastern Iowa attorney to the seven-member panel. Dana Oxley, the only female finalist on the list forwarded to the governor Jan. 9, is an attorney who has questioned the importance of abiding by past decisions. In her application she said that the court should “not blindly apply its prior decisions but must be vigilant in protecting the rule of law.” Oxley, 52, of Swisher is the second woman on the court, joining Susan Christensen, appointed by Reynolds in 2018. Oxley is only the fourth woman ever named to the state’s highest court. Reynolds said gender was not a factor in her choice. “We need more women in the courts, yes, but I don’t make my decision based on gender. They earned those selections,” Reynolds said. “She’s smart; she’s articulate; she’s hard-working; she brings a breadth of experience to the court.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Cropland that turned into a crime scene of serial slayings in the 1870s is up for auction. The 162-acre tract where the Bender family killed at least 11 people will be sold off to the highest bidder by an auction company next month, The Wichita Eagle reports. Accounts say the family of four who came to be known as the “Bloody Benders” would lure travelers into their home, inviting them for a hot meal and a place to rest. Once seated at the dinner table, instead of hospitality, these travelers would get their throats slit or heads bashed in – their bodies tossed into the cellar until they were able to be hauled out and buried at night. An 1873 excavation found 11 bodies in the garden, although some suspect the Benders killed up to 21 people. When people became suspicious over the missing travelers, the Benders fled. They were never captured. The Feb. 11 auction is open to the public.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A transgender candidate for the state House is criticizing three GOP bills affecting the transgender community. One measure would prohibit students from using public restrooms that don’t align with their “biological sex,” another would make it a felony for doctors to prescribe gender-altering medications to minors, and a third would require student-athletes to play sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate. Democrat Ramona Thomas, who began transitioning in 2017, said Tuesday that she wants to fight to protect transgender youth. Thomas is running for a House seat to represent southwestern Jefferson County. “These bills are the end result of LGBT people and trans people not being present in our government for so long,” Thomas said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A military veteran who was sent to prison for life after selling less than 1 gram of marijuana to an undercover investigator should be allowed to pursue an appeal of the harsh sentence, defense attorneys told the Supreme Court of Louisiana on Monday. Attorneys representing Derrick Harris said that during a habitual offender sentencing hearing, his trial lawyer failed to note mitigating circumstances, including mental health problems and drug addiction following his service during Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s. Those factors would have allowed the judge to impose less than the life sentence called for under Louisiana’s habitual offender statutes, his lawyers at Monday’s hearing said. In addition, an appellate lawyer failed to raise some of the trial lawyer’s failures in an initial appeal, according to a brief filed for Harris.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state ranks last in New England in access to high-speed internet, but a new push from state and federal leaders seeks to change that. A proposal before the Legislature would provide $15 million to ConnectME Authority, which seeks to bring broadband to more households in the state. The proposal, submitted by Democratic Sen. Erin Herbig of Belfast, received a public hearing Tuesday. Also, officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills are expected to make an announcement Thursday in Arrowsic about new broadband investments around the state. USDA officials called the new push “a multimillion-dollar Reconnect Pilot Program investment.” The pilot program provides grants and loans to improve broadband access in rural areas. The USDA funding will bring high-speed internet to more than 4,500 homes in Maine, officials with the agency said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Chesapeake flavor of Old Bay seasoning has been turned into a hot sauce. Hours after the release of a limited-edition Old Bay hot sauce, McCormick & Co.’s website sold out. In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, the company thanked its ardent fans for their love and said it is restocking. In an earlier press release, McCormick said the new sauce would hit stores in the next month. The company suggests using it to “warm up” foods like chili, soup, chicken wings, nachos and dips, as well as drinks like Bloody Marys. Old Bay Hot Sauce will be sold in Acme, Giant, Food Lion, Safeway and Wegmans, among other grocery stores. The company says it will also be offered in “many local favorite restaurants.” A 10-ounce bottle retails for $3.49. Old Bay seasoning is a trademark of Maryland seafood, but some loyalists in the region will use it on almost anything.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAuburn: The battle to eradicate Asian longhorned beetles continues over a decade after the species was first discovered in the Worcester area. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that an infested tree was discovered Jan. 14 at Pakachoag Golf Course in Auburn. Officials said survey crews will search trees on public and private property around the area where the infested tree was discovered, the Telegram & Gazette reports. Rhonda Santos, spokeswoman for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said there were no other infested trees when the area was inspected last week. The infested tree was a red maple tree, according to Santos. Santos said there were no adult beetles found, but there were egg sites and emergence holes. Tree climbers will be dispatched to the area to conduct additional surveys for the next one to two weeks, according to Santos.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has signed a $2.5 million agreement to design a project to remediate contaminated sediment and create a substantial new habitat at a riverfront park being developed in the city. The contaminated sediment at the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Centennial Park is within the Detroit River Area of Concern and identified by the U.S. and Canada as one of 43 toxic hot spots in the Great Lakes basin, according to the EPA. The project agreement allows the EPA to evaluate and develop a plan along the shoreline of the 22-acre site along the city’s west riverfront. Work will be funded through a Great Lakes Legacy Act cost-sharing partnership with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, which has agreed to contribute nearly $900,000 to the project’s cost.\n\nMinnesota\n\nGrand Portage: Ryan Redington has won the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon in northeastern Minnesota for the second time in three years. The Alaskan musher and his huskies spent more than 29 hours on the nearly 300-mile trail along Lake Superior before arriving in Grand Portage late Tuesday afternoon. The Star Tribune says Redington comes from a family of dog mushers. He won the Beargrease marathon in 2018 and has competed in numerous races, including Alaska’s famous Iditarod, which his grandfather founded. The seven dogs who finished the race with Redington were treated to hunks of frozen meat. A sleep-deprived Redington said he was looking forward to a shower and a warm meal. Redington’s team crossed about 15 minutes ahead of second-place finisher Keith Aili, of Ray, Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The University of Southern Mississippi expects hundreds of children’s librarians, teachers, and fans of books for children and young adults at its 53rd Fay B. Kaigler Children’s Book Festival on April 1-3. The event at the Hattiesburg campus includes lectures and workshops featuring renowned authors and illustrators and other experts in the field. The Wednesday-through-Friday festival also includes presentation of the Ezra Jack Keats Awards and the Magnolia Book Awards. The Keats title honors an outstanding new writer and an outstanding new illlustrator. Mississippi children and teens will vote in February for Magnolia Book Awards in four age categories. The festival’s top award, the Southern Miss Medallion, is going to Rita Williams-Garcia, who has written a dozen young adult and middle-grade novels.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The State Capitol dome will shine red for the Kansas City Chiefs as the team prepares to make its first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years. Gov. Mike Parson announced in a news release that he ordered the dome to glow in the team’s color Friday night. Parson said that as a season-ticket holder and longtime fan, he “couldn’t be more excited for the Chiefs.” The team’s last Super Bowl appearance was in 1970, when the Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings. Parson said it’s “about time we had another big win.” The Chiefs are playing the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in Miami.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: They hope to come up with a plan everyone can bear. The state kicked off a two-day summit Wednesday for groups that educate the public about grizzly bears with encouragement from the head of Fish, Wildlife and Parks to teach people how to live with and understand the ursines. “People were surprised at how many different efforts are going on right now at education and information regarding grizzly bears,” FWP Director Martha Williams said about conversations during a dinner with attendees the night before. Grizzly bear populations are growing in Montana, including into areas where they have not lived for decades, state officials said. Grizzly bears are listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in all areas of Montana, and delisting efforts continue in places where recovery goals have been met. There are reportedly more than 1,850 grizzly bears in north-central and northwestern Montana and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: The driver of a snowplow plunged the vehicle into the Platte River on Tuesday as he was being followed by authorities who later arrested him. U.S. marshals and Sarpy County sheriff’s deputies believed the driver of the Nebraska Department of Transportation snowplow was a wanted federal fugitive and began following the plow on a highway south of Gretna. After a few minutes, Deputy U.S. Marshal Will Iverson said the plow left the road and went down an embankment into the river. The driver managed to get out of the cab, and officers pulled him from the river. The driver’s name wasn’t released, but the Transportation Department told the Lincoln Journal Star he was employed by the agency. After being treated at a hospital, he was taken to jail. Charges against him remain sealed.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: About 1 in 10 people booked last year into the two largest jails in the city had no permanent place to live, a police official told a panel studying homelessness last week. Las Vegas Department of Public Safety Lt. Danielle Davis told the group the homeless make up about 10% of the overall city jail population, but one measurement put the figure at just over 15% of the more than 33,000 people booked last year, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Of the nearly 75,000 people processed into the Clark County Detention Center in 2019, just over 6% identified themselves as homeless, Las Vegas Metropolitan police Capt. Neldon Barrowes said. The presentations came with the city beginning Feb. 1 to enforce a law making it illegal for people to sleep on streets when beds are available at established shelters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A pair of civil engineers took their relationship to new heights atop a local bridge. Dan Del Tufo arranged to have the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth lifted to its maximum height, and that’s where he surprised Julia Kallmerten with a marriage proposal – so she could, in his words, “aggravate me for the rest of my life.” She said yes. The couple met at the University of New Hampshire, and both have worked on projects around the bridge, The Boston Globe reports. “This is not something we typically do, but through the description of the work they did at UNH and the work that (Julia) has done, DOT approved the request as long it could be tied to normal bridge maintenance operations,” said Eileen Meaney, communications officer for the New Hampshire Department of Transportation. “They were super cute, and we wish them the best.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A motorcyclist cited for turning his license plate upside down because he thought “it was cool” has lost another bid to rescind a traffic ticket he received. In a ruling issued Tuesday, a state appellate court determined that the ticket and the $139 penalty Scott DiRoma received in municipal court were both justified. The ruling upheld a decision issued by a Somerset County judge. DiRoma was driving his motorcycle in Warren Township in June 2018 when he was stopped by a police officer who noticed his license plate was mounted upside down. DiRoma told the officer he liked the way the plate looked and “wanted to be different,” authorities said. A municipal court judge eventually imposed a $106 fine and $33 in court costs after DiRoma was found guilty of violating a state law mandating that license plates be kept clear and distinct.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A Democrat-backed bill to legalize recreational marijuana businesses in all towns and counties across the state passed its first test late Tuesday amid heighten interested from businesses and health care advocates. The Senate Public Affairs Committee voted 4-3 along party lines to move along the measure that would subsidize medical marijuana and automatically expunge many past pot convictions. The committee had to convene on the Senate floor to accommodate crowds around a proposal that would subsidize medical marijuana for low-income patients and expunge many past pot convictions. An initial draft of the bill from Democratic Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino of Albuquerque would also override local governments that don’t welcome the industry. The condition is an attempt to stamp out black markets. “This is the future,” Ben Lewinger, executive director of the New Mexico Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, told lawmakers. “New Mexico doesn’t have time to waste precious years.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Bureau of Prisons is holding off on transferring the warden who was in charge of the New York City jail where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. The agency said Tuesday that it would defer the transfer of Lamine N’Diaye to a leadership role at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security prison in Burlington County, New Jersey, until the internal investigation is completed into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Epstein was found unresponsive in his jail cell Aug. 10 and was later pronounced dead. The Associated Press reported last week that N’Diaye was to be transferred despite multiple active investigations into Epstein’s death. The agency’s backtracking came after Attorney General William Barr stepped in and told officials at the Bureau of Prisons to reverse course given the active investigations, a person familiar with the matter told the AP.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nApex: A man who survived an attempted lynching in 1952 was helped by hundreds of people to move to a new home Tuesday so a highway can be expanded. Lynn Council, 87, planned to move into a new house in Apex after living in his current home for more than 60 years, news outlets report. Council was accused decades ago of a robbery he didn’t commit. Two deputies hanged him from a tree to try to get him to confess. When he didn’t, the deputies took him down. Council later settled into a home just outside Apex. About 20 years ago, he took out a $20,000 federal home repair loan. One condition of the loan was that the full amount must be paid if he moved out or died. The state recently bought Council’s home so the Department of Transportation can expand the NC-540 highway. That meant he needed to pay back the $20,000 loan. Garrett Raczek learned about Council’s story and launched an online fundraiser that by early Thursday had exceeded $24,000.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: City leaders are considering a change to an ordinance that restricts selling firearms and ammunition from home. City Commissioner Tony Gehring says the state has no restrictions on it, and if there is no good reason for the law enacted in 2001, it should be fixed. Duane Spooner, owner of Duane’s Gun Repair, tells KVLY-TV he welcomes the potential change and doesn’t think it would have a negative impact on his business. “I think from the city standpoint, it’s a positive thing to look at,” Spooner said. “Why would you want to do something that stops commerce in your city?” Fargo commissioners have sent the law to the city planning staff and law enforcement so they can research and review it and provide a recommendation.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Nearly halfway into a 10-year pledge to combat the toxic algae that turns Lake Erie a ghastly shade of green, the state has made little progress. Its patchwork of mostly voluntary efforts hasn’t slowed the farm fertilizers that feed algae blooms, leading to contaminated drinking water and dead fish. Ohio’s governor has authorized an ambitious plan that this year will begin offering farmers financial incentives to adopt new agriculture practices and will create a network of wetlands to capture and filter runoff from fields. The broad approach is being watched closely by states struggling with an increasing number of algae outbreaks. Some environmental groups are skeptical, but others that have been at odds with the farming industry are hopeful. While there are no guarantees the strategy will revive the shallowest of the Great Lakes, there are potential pitfalls, including a lawsuit calling for tougher regulations, that could upend the state’s goal of drastically reducing nutrient pollution entering the lake’s western end by 2025.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The state’s prison population has dropped below 25,000 for the first time in more than a decade, but the system is still overcrowded. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections’ weekly population count for Jan. 21 was 24,992, Tulsa World reports. The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ year-end data shows that the state’s prison population hadn’t been below 25,000 since 2009. Adam Luck, a member of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, credited positive changes to significant justice reform measures. But he said the state would benefit from engaging in a tough conversation about prison population goals. “It’s often overlooked, but there’s a deeper conversation we need to have – how over capacity we are even including all of the bunk beds we’ve added,” Luck said. The system is at 101% capacity, with state institutions at 109% and contracted private prisons at 93%, according to corrections department data.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Rockslides triggered by unrelenting rain have closed local roads and highways around the state, including a highway near Crater Lake National Park that was closed for hours Tuesday after two boulders the size of a small living room crashed down, narrowly missing a passing car. The giant boulders fell from a hillside that has endured pounding rain and repeated freezing and thawing of the rock because of harsh winter conditions, said Gary Leaming, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation. The driver of the Toyota SUV came around a curve on the windy and rural highway near Prospect, Oregon, and swerved to miss the first boulder but crashed into the second. The boulders are about 15 feet by 15 feet, he said, and dwarfed the large SUV in size.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPunxsutawney: Every Feb. 2 for more than 130 years, Punxsutawney Phil and his handlers have trekked to Gobbler’s Knob, where the groundhog is tasked with predicting the remaining winter season. This year, however, animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wants the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club to break from tradition, calling for the replacement of Punxsutawney Phil with an animatronic groundhog. In a Tuesday letter to club President Bill Deeley, PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said it is “long overdue for Phil to be retired.” She cited the “great stress” groundhogs feel when in “close proximity to the public.” Newkirk proposed a replacement for the live groundhog: an animatronic animal with artificial intelligence “that could actually predict the weather.” She said using animatronics in lieu of live animals is now “more popular than ever.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The new superintendent for the struggling Providence Public School District says he’ll work with a sense of urgency to unleash “hope and opportunity” for students. Harrison Peters was introduced this week as the superintendent charged with turning the district around. Peters, the outgoing chief of schools for Hillsborough County Public Schools in Florida, said that while he believes genius and talent is distributed equally across zip codes, he has found that opportunity is not. He said he will be a superintendent who moves with a sense of urgency, passion, purpose and respect. Rhode Island took control of Providence’s schools Nov. 1. It’s expected to take at least five years to turn around a district that has been beleaguered by low test scores, crumbling infrastructure and widespread dysfunction.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Dozens of teachers returned to the Statehouse on Wednesday to remind lawmakers they have their own ideas about how to reform education, a debate that continues to drag on in the Legislature. The teacher-led organization SC for Ed, which organized a rally of more than 10,000 people in support of teachers last year, prompting several school districts to close, has said its only planned actions so far this year are to talk to lawmakers and attend meetings. But the grassroots group’s social media hashtag #ScforEdDressRehearsal was a reminder of its March 17 deadline for lawmakers to set their goals. If they don’t meet the deadline, the group said, it will consider another walkout. The teachers who showed up Wednesday wore red, the color the organization adopted as its symbol for action.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nOglala: Oglala Sioux Tribe members will vote in March on whether marijuana should be legalized on the Pine Ridge Reservation and whether alcohol should be served in its casinos. Voters will answer three separate questions March 10: Should medical marijuana be available on the reservation? What about recreational marijuana? Also, should alcohol be sold at Prairie Wind Casino near Oglala and East Wind Casino near Martin? The referendums requite a majority of votes to pass, and the decisions would be binding, meaning the tribal council must implement them, according to Elections Commission executive Sandra Old Horse. The Rapid City Journal reports eligible voters are enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe who are at least 18 years old and have lived on the reservation for at least one year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two East Tennessee legislators are attempting to place a long-awaited statue of David Crockett outside the state Capitol in place of a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who was a prohibitionist leader and espoused racist views. Rep. David Hawk, R-Greeneville, and Sen. Steve Southerland, R-Morristown, are introducing a bill to move the statue of Edward Carmack, currently on display along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard above the Motlow Tunnel entrance to the Capitol, and replace it with one of Crockett. The Carmack statue would be moved to a new spot on the grounds, the bill says. Crockett, a pioneer and Tennessee politician who became a folk legend, has had a bust on display since 2016 on the second floor of the Capitol, outside the House of Representatives’ chamber.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: More than 20 police officers have been suspended without pay after an internal investigation found they failed to account for money won in gambling stings, document their use of police funds and properly place seized property into evidence, among other policy violations, officials announced Wednesday. None of the detectives and supervisors, who previously served on the city’s vice squad, will face criminal charges because prosecutors determined the nearly three-year investigation found “insufficient evidence” that the law was broken, the police department said. The group acknowledged some policy violations, but poor documentation prevented investigators from determining what happened to some of the funds and seized gambling machines, according to the department. Some officers were accused of giving internal affairs detectives false or misleading statements.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s new medical marijuana program will launch on time in the coming weeks, though health officials said Wednesday that it will start small. One or two dispensaries are expected to open the first week of March, when people can begin getting patient cards that will allow them to legally buy the drug in the state. To get the cards, they will need a recommendation from a doctor, which may be a challenge because the number of medical providers interested in recommending the drug has been “very limited,” said Marc Babitz, deputy director with the Utah Department of Health. Some medical providers may be hesitant because it remains illegal on a federal level, he said. But Utah is the 33rd state to legalize medical cannabis, and no doctors have been prosecuted. “I think this is actually much safer than a lot of the medications that we use,” he told a panel of lawmakers.\n\nVermont\n\nQuechee: A bird rehabilitation center treated a record number of wild birds last year, staff with the institute say. The Vermont Institute of Natural Science says staffers treated a record total of 705 wild birds in 2019 at the institute’s Center for Wild Bird Rehabilitation, and 77 of those were barred owls. In 2018, the institute treated 45 barred owls, out of 652 birds total, Valley News reports. The weather and an increase in public awareness contributed to the higher numbers, said Grae O’Toole, the lead wildlife keeper at the institute. “We weren’t expecting the influx that we received (last) winter,” she said. “They’re just not able to punch through the ice to get to prey on their own.” In addition to the barred owls, staff also treated a pine grosbeak and a Bohemian waxwing, songbird species that are typically found farther north in Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s attorney general, who has vowed to go to court if needed to see the Equal Rights Amendment adopted, plans to announce “landmark civil rights litigation” dealing with the proposed constitutional amendment, his office announced Wednesday. Attorney General Mark Herring is partnering on the lawsuit with fellow Democratic attorneys general Kwame Raoul of Illinois and Aaron Ford of Nevada, Herring’s office said in a news release. A news conference to discuss it is planned for Thursday. The announcement came two days after Virginia became the critical 38th state to ratify the measure, which would prohibit discrimination based on sex. Nevada and Illinois were the next-most recent states to ratify the ERA – Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. The ERA’s future is uncertain, in part because of a 1982 deadline for ratification that Congress enacted decades ago.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Another endangered orca is missing and presumed dead in the Pacific Northwest, a large male who had fathered many of the population’s calves in the past three decades. The whale, born in 1977 and known as L41 or by the nickname Mega, was not with his family when researchers encountered them last Friday, the Center for Whale Research said. He was last seen last summer, and he appeared thin then. Shari Tarantino, president of the Orca Conservancy, said L41’s death would leave just 72 animals in the “southern resident” population of orcas that frequents the waters between Washington and Canada. That’s the fewest since the mid-1970s, after more than 50 were captured for aquarium display or killed in the process. The whales have struggled with pollution, vessel noise and most significantly a dearth of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon. Researchers say they are on the brink of extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A federal agency has proposed designating habitat areas for two protected crayfish species in coalfield regions. The proposal announced in a statement this week by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would protect 362 stream miles for the Big Sandy crayfish and 83 miles for the Guyandotte River crayfish. The Guyandotte crayfish is listed as an endangered species and the Big Sandy crayfish as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the Guyandotte River crayfish has lost more than 90% of its range and is now only found in two streams in Wyoming County, West Virginia. The Big Sandy crayfish, whose range has been reduced by more than 60%, is found in the upper Big Sandy watershed in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky. The environmental group alleged in a 2018 lawsuit that the species were being harmed by sediment from coal mining operations that disturbed their stream habitat.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The School of Architecture at Taliesin, which architect Frank Lloyd Wright opened in 1932, will close in June, the school announced Tuesday. Approximately 30 students are currently enrolled at the school, splitting their time between Taliesin West, Wright’s winter home in north Scottsdale, Arizona, and Taliesin in Wisconsin. The school’s governing board made the decision to close Saturday, after the school was unable to reach an agreement with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to keep the school open, according to the announcement. The foundation issued a statement saying the school’s governing board “had communicated unequivocally to the Foundation that the School did not have a sustainable business model that would allow it to maintain its operation as an accredited program.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An annual sled dog race through Wyoming and Idaho begins Friday. The first day of the 25th annual Pedigree Stage Stop Sled Dog Race is for show. Teams will run through downtown Jackson and finish at a park on the south side of town. From there, racers go to Alpine, Pinedale, Kemmerer, Big Piney/Marbleton, Lander and Driggs, Idaho, before finishing near Lower Slide Lake northeast of Jackson on Feb. 8. The racers will compete for $165,000 in prize money. This year’s race will discontinue eight-dog teams and feature only traditional 10-dog teams, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Canadian musher Anny Malo won the 10-dog race in 2019. She completed her first appearance in the event in a cumulative time of 14 hours, 34 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/30/obamas-break-ground-missing-zebras-planet-word-bathrooms-news-around-states/119000794/", "title": "50 States - USA Today", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nSept. 30, 2021, 12:38 a.m. ET\n\nAlabama\n\nBrighton: Police have recovered a horse-drawn carriage that was stolen from a church parking lot near Birmingham ahead of a funeral. The carriage and the trailer it was on were found Monday behind a home about 20 miles from the church in Brighton where it was taken, al.com reported. Brighton Police Chief Larry Woods told the news site multiple people are in custody in connection with the theft. The owner of the carriage, Frank Tate, said it was valued at more than $15,000. His company, Magic Tours, provides carriages for funerals, downtown Birmingham tours and other special occasions. Tate told al.com he left the carriage in the parking lot of St. Mark AME Church to pick up horses. He planned to use it later on Saturday to take a family to a funeral, but when he returned about 9 a.m., it was gone. He said the carriage would be hard to hide. “It’s a distinctive carriage,’’ Tate said. “Nobody else around here has carriages.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. prosecutors have charged three men with leaving a special viewing platform and getting too close to bears in Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve. The U.S. attorney’s office filed charges last week in the August 2018 incident. Spokesperson Lisa Houghton said the office doesn’t discuss the timing of cases. “Every case is unique, and it takes varying amounts of time to bring forth criminal charges,” she said by email. The remote park on the northern Alaska Peninsula protects some of the highest densities of bears in the world and requires visitors to abide by special rules. Mature male brown bears at Katmai can weigh up to 900 pounds, the park said. The charges alleged the men entered a closed area of the park by leaving an authorized viewing area and wading into the Brooks River when bears were feeding on salmon in the nearby falls. The U.S. attorney’s office said two of the men are from Alaska and one is from New Mexico. An online court records system did not show attorneys for the men who could comment on their behalf.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed former television broadcaster Kari Lake in the Republican race for governor. Trump retains a strong following among many Republicans and his endorsement catapults the former news anchor into clear front-runner status in the crowded GOP primary field. Lake is a political newcomer who left her job in March and launched her bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 2022 in June. She had been widely seen as a possible candidate and has criticized a media landscape that she contends needs more balance.Trump announced his endorsement via email because he remains banned from Twitter and other social media sites following the Jan. 6 incidents at the U.S. Capitol. He said Lake is strong on crime, the border and supports gun rights. He also took a shot at Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who is term-limited. Using the expression for “Republican in name only,” Trump said “she will do a far better job than RINO Governor Doug Ducey.” Ducey certified President Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona over Trump last year despite pressure from the former president to overturn the election results.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday said he allowed the state’s public health emergency for the coronavirus pandemic to end, saying he didn’t need any additional powers to respond to it. Hutchinson told reporters he didn’t seek an extension from the Legislature for the emergency, which expired Monday. But Hutchinson cautioned that the state is still feeling the effects of COVID-19, which the Health Department on Tuesday said had claimed another 21 lives in the state. “I need to emphasize that we are still in a pandemic. We still have 20 plus people dying every day because of COVID,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news conference. “Just because the technical emergency was not extended does not mean we’re not still in a very serious situation with the pandemic and the actions we need to take.” Arkansas lifted most of its virus restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate, and ended its emergency declaration last spring. But Hutchinson in July reinstated the emergency as the state saw a surge in cases due to the delta variant of the virus. The Health Department said the state’s death toll from COVID-19 now totals 7,651. The state reported its cases rose by 800 to 493,920 total since the pandemic began.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State Treasurer Fiona Ma repeatedly shared hotel rooms with employees, a practice she said saved money but that business experts contend crosses an ethical line and can lead to lawsuits like one Ma now faces, the Sacramento Bee reported Tuesday. Judith Blackwell, the former head of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, sued Ma in July, alleging sexual harassment, racial discrimination and wrongful termination. Ma said the allegations are without merit. Records obtained by the Bee show Ma shared a hotel room with her chief of staff, Genevieve Jopanda, 13 times over two years. She also stayed with four other aides at a three-bedroom property on a trip. There’s no policy in the state’s human resources manual on whether managers and staff can share hotel rooms. Ma said her work as state treasurer frequently requires her and aides to travel across the state and that the hotel rooms were shared to save money.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverthorne: The residents of several hundred homes have been evacuated or warned to be ready to leave because of a wildfire burning in Colorado’s north-central mountains. Evacuations were first ordered Monday night near Silverthorne shortly after the fire was reported on U.S. Forest Service land. The Ptarmigan Fire was burning on about 60 acres around midday Tuesday, after growing about 40 acres overnight, an amount which surprised officials, Dillon District Ranger Adam Bianchi said, the Summit Daily News reported. Air tankers and a helicopter were initially used to try to slow the fire’s growth and prevent it from moving downhill toward residential areas because it was considered too dangerous to send in firefighters on the ground. Officials have some hope that forecasted cooler weather in the mountains, where it has been dropping below freezing at night, and possible rain and snow in the coming days will also help.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate voted Tuesday to extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s emergency powers for the sixth time during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite pushback from Republican lawmakers who argued the state is no longer in crisis. “It all needs to end,” said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott. “No one can deny that there’s no public health emergency and that individual, local and legislative powers must be restored.” Yet Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said state legislators have a “much stronger reason” to extend the public health and civil preparedness emergencies than back in July, the last time Lamont’s powers were extended until Sept. 30. He noted how the state’s COVID positivity rate and number of hospitalizations have increased since then because of the delta variant. The resolution to extend the governor’s powers until Feb. 15 passed 18-15 on Tuesday with two Democrats joining the Republicans in opposition. Three senators were absent. The vote came day after the House of Representatives voted 80-60 in favor of extending Lamont’s renewed declaration of public health and civil preparedness emergencies until early February, when the General Assembly’s regular legislative session is scheduled to open. Democrats control both chambers.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: All teachers and school staff in Delaware will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. The requirement announced by Carney, the Division of Public Health and Department of Education will be formally issued by emergency regulation and takes effect Nov. 1. The requirement also applies to contractors and volunteers who work in K-12 public and private schools. The top priority has been to get all students back in school this fall and the mandate will help minimize disruptions, Carney said in a statement. “There’s no better way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and keep all Delaware children in their classrooms, than to get vaccinated,” Carney said. “These vaccines are safe and extremely protective against COVID-19 infection and serious illness. I encourage all Delawareans to get your shot and help us finally put an end to this pandemic.” The Delaware State Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, supports the decision and urges members to get vaccinated, according to a statement from President Stephanie Ingram. The union’s goal is to keep educators and students in school while protecting their health, Ingram said. Since some have concerns about the vaccine, weekly testing is a “reasonable alternative,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The city’s new Planet Word museum is being lauded for its lavatories, WUSA-TV reported. Cintas, the cleaning product and services company, selected 10 places across the country for the cleanest, most innovative commodes, and Planet Word is among the finalists. “Planet Word is flush with bathroom humor,” said founder Ann Friedman, reading a slogan from one of the walls. She has a bit of a potty mouth. “Here’s our take on Shakespeare. ‘Farting is such sweet sorrow,’” she said, opening a stall and revealing the slogan painted behind a porcelain throne.The toilets on the second floor of the downtown museum are ripe with ribald literary references. “To pee or not to pee, that is the question,” is emblazoned in another stall. Then there’s “If at first you don’t succeed, flush, flush again.” and “I stink, therefore I am.” The museum has five floors, with restrooms on each, each with its own theme. “Here we have euphemisms for No. 1 and No. 2,” she said on the main floor. They include: “Take a whiz”...and others maybe we shouldn’t mention. Even Friedman’s a little embarrassed by some of the bathroom humor. Although when she was looking for donors, the phrase, “Take the Browns to the Super Bowl,” may have helped her close the deal with a guy from Ohio.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A group of South Florida businessmen sued the federal government Monday in hopes of overturning a gambling agreement Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed with the Seminole Tribe. The suit filed against the Department of the Interior in federal court in Washington claims the agreement illegally expands gambling in Florida. Among the plaintiffs are developer Armando Codina and car dealer Norman Braman. The department approved the deal in August. It allows the Seminole Tribe to operate sports betting and add roulette and craps to its seven Florida casinos, with the state potentially receiving $20 billion over the next 30 years. But the lawsuit claimed that the state constitution requires voters approve an expansion of gambling. The state Legislature approved the deal in May. It is the second suit filed challenging the gambling compact.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Logistics company Radial Inc. plans to hire 4,000 entry-level workers outside Atlanta this year ahead of the busy holiday season, the company announced Tuesday. The new employees will work out of two Atlanta-area fulfillment centers – one in Locust Grove and one in Buford – to process online orders from various different brands, Radial said in a news release. The company then plans to promote more than one-third of the seasonal employees to full-time positions, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. According to the statement, research conducted by Radial shows that 65% of shoppers plan to spend either increased or similar amounts of money on online purchases this year compared to 2020. The site director of the Locust Grove fulfillment center, Eric Narvaez, did not disclose how much the positions would be paid but said the pay would be similar to that of other large companies like Home Depot and Amazon, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. regulators on Tuesday banned swimming with Hawaii’s spinner dolphins to protect the nocturnal animals from people seeking close encounters with the playful species. Swimming with dolphins is a popular tourist activity in Hawaii. Several companies offer tours that take swimmers to areas frequented by dolphins with the aim of giving them an opportunity to get in the water with the animals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule under the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits swimming with or getting within 50 yards of a spinner dolphin that is within 2 nautical miles of the shore of the main Hawaiian Islands. The rule applies to boats, canoes, stand-up paddleboards, drones or other objects. NOAA also is proposing a regulation that would prohibit entering certain areas between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. in parts of the Big Island and Maui that are considered essential daytime habitats for spinner dolphins. Spinner dolphins hunt in offshore waters at night. During the day, they use areas close to shore that have optimal environmental conditions to socialize, nurture their young, hide from predators and rest in preparation for nightly hunting. Hawaii’s spinner dolphins get their name from their habit of leaping in the air and spinning around. Some scientists say such behavior is not always playfulness and can instead be an attempt to alert others to danger.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Schools should set up confidential tip lines that can be used by students and others to report concerning behavior as a way to prevent school shootings, a report reviewing an eastern Idaho school shooting said. That’s one of 29 recommendations in the report released Monday by the Idaho State Board of Education following a school shooting at Rigby Middle School in May. Authorities said a sixth grade girl injured two other students and a custodian after pulling a handgun from her backpack and firing multiple rounds inside and outside the school. She was ultimately disarmed by a teacher. The report said students saw behavioral changes in the accused attacker, but that didn’t come to light until after the shooting. The report, made by the School Safety and Security Program, noted that the behavior change was not apparent to school staff because the girl was in her first year at Rigby Middle School after moving up from elementary school. The same school had another incident last week when authorities said a 13-year-old girl brought a gun to school, but was disarmed by a school resource officer in the bathroom, and no one was injured. Immediately after that incident, Jefferson School District Superintendent Chad Martin banned backpacks at two middle schools and two high schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After five years of legal fights, gentrification concerns and a federal review, Barack and Michelle Obama dug shovels into the ground Tuesday during a celebratory groundbreaking on the Obama Presidential Center. Construction on the center along Lake Michigan, near the Obama family home and where the former president started his political career on Chicago’s South Side, officially began last month. Standing near an excavator and other heavy equipment, Obama described how the city’s South Side shaped him, first as a community organizer, then as a husband, father and elected official. He said the center was one way of giving back and he hoped it would bring an economic boost to the area and inspire a future generation of leaders. “We want this center to be more than a static museum or a source of archival research. It won’t just be a collection of campaign memorabilia or Michelle’s ballgowns, although I know everybody will come see those,” he joked. “It won’t just be an exercise in nostalgia or looking backwards. We want to look forward.” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and several city aldermen were among the few people allowed at the event, which was streamed online to limit crowds amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The presidential center will sit on 19 acres of the 540-acre of Jackson Park, named for the nation’s seventh president, Andrew Jackson.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: A historical marker has been dedicated in western Indiana in remembrance of a Black man lynched about 120 years ago by a white mob. George Ward’s descendants, Terre Haute residents and Mayor Duke Bennett were among those at Sunday’s ceremony in Fairbanks Park, the (Terre Haute) Tribune-Star reported. George Ward was arrested in 1901 in the slaying of a white teacher, Ida Finkelstein. The mob took him from the Vigo County Jail and struck him in the head with a sledgehammer, said Terry Ward, adding that the attackers grabbed his great-grandfather along a bridge and bystanders pelted him with sticks. “Imagine the pain and the fear and no one comes to your aid,” Terry Ward told those at the dedication. George Ward then was hanged from a former wagon bridge. His body later was cut down and burned. “George Ward was denied due process for a crime for which he was accused,” Terry Ward said. “He was killed by a mob that acted as judge, jury and executioner.” The dedication was part of the national Community Remembrance Project, which recognizes lynching victims.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The longtime president of the Des Moines police officers’ union sent explicit photos to four female colleagues but retired before he could face discipline and wasn’t criminally charged, the city confirmed late Tuesday. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, four Des Moines Police Department employees alleged that they were sent unsolicited photos by Des Moines Police Bargaining Unit Association President Stew Barnes in 2019 and 2020, including many of himself naked. The department let Barnes, 61, retire in August 2020 with full benefits despite “overwhelming evidence” of his harassment of co-workers and employees of a tanning salon and a credit union, the lawsuit claimed. Department leaders recognized him at a retirement banquet in October 2020. Iowa law allows the state pension system to deny retirement benefits to members who are not “in good standing,” including those who face pending disciplinary proceedings for misconduct. The lawsuit argued that Barnes should have been disqualified from benefits and faced a criminal investigation, alleging he was using police resources “to find and stalk women” and that his victims were ready to cooperate. A statement through the city manager’s office defended the department and the city’s handling of the internal investigation but did not explain the lack of a criminal investigation. Barnes confirmed to have sent the inappropriate photos and resigned his job before the inquiry concluded, the statement said. Police Chief Dana Wingert later determined the misconduct occurred and that it would have been a fireable offense.\n\nKansas\n\nSanta Fe:John Freeman Colt, a convicted sex offender who escaped June 30 from Larned State Hospital, was captured Monday night in Wayne County, Utah. Colt’s arrest came after residents recognized him from a wanted poster they saw on TV and contacted the U.S. Marshals Service and the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office, the marshals service said in a news release Tuesday. “As sheriff’s deputies were staging in a parking lot near the target house, they saw Colt roll by on his blue motorcycle and gave chase,” the marshals service said. “Colt eventually decided to give up.” Colt was being held Tuesday in Utah awaiting his return to Kansas, according to the news release.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State police said new regional driver testing branches have been created in Madisonville and Owensboro. The Madisonville office serves Caldwell, Crittenden, Hopkins, McLean, Muhlenberg and Webster counties, and the Owensboro site is for residents of Daviess, Hancock, and Ohio counties. Gov. Andy Beshear said the regional testing locations offer more efficient services. Driver testing was offered starting Monday in both locations. Appointments can be made online and are available Monday through Friday at the state police website. Appointments are required for a permit, driver’s license or commercial driver’s license test. Officials are working to open the remaining regional offices statewide by June 30.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Five people were injured in an explosion at a chemical plant, news outlets reported. The explosion at the Westlake petrochemical plant near Lake Charles was reported late Monday night, Louisiana State Police spokesman Derek Senegal said. He said five workers were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not immediately known. A fire at the site is now out, and the cause of the blast is under investigation. KPLC-TV reported that the unit where the explosion occurred is used in the production of ethylene and was undergoing maintenance at the time.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The owner of four hydroelectric dams on the Kennebec River sued two Maine agencies alleging they improperly cooperated on fish passage regulations that impact the future of the dams and fish populations. The lawsuit filed in Kennebec Superior Court is the latest brought by Brookfield Renewable Power, a subsidiary of a large Canadian company that owns many of the dams in the state, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lawsuit contended the Department of Marine Resources improperly helped the Department of Environmental Protection draft fish passage policies, claiming that the cooperation between state agencies violates a 1993 settlement between the dams’ then-owners, environmental groups and state and federal bodies. The company argued under that settlement, disputes about fish passage standards related to the dams must be resolved through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which licenses dams. The Shawmut dam is under review for FERC relicensing and must get water quality approval from Maine as part of that process.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: Five zebras that escaped from a farm nearly a month ago are still on the loose. They got away Aug. 31 from a private farm near Upper Marlboro, about 20 miles southeast of the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reported. Prince George’s County animal control officials told the newspaper the caretakers have been trying to lure the animals into a fenced feeding area ever since. Zebras have to be corralled to be captured, not chased. Three of the animals have been traveling together while the other two have been in a pair, officials said. Residents have been sharing stories of zebra sightings on social media. Joshua DuBois, who worked for the White House during the Obama administration, tweeted Sept. 19 that he and his wife dressed up their three children in zebra-print outfits to go “zebra hunting.” He shared a video and photos of when they found the animals. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton – who represents Washington in Congress – joked in a Sept. 10 statement that despite her general support for freedom and her recent opposition to fences, referring to the fences around the U.S. Capitol, she was not responsible for setting the zebras free.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMelrose: A home seriously damaged by fire has been listed on the market with an asking price of $399,000. WBZ-TV reported Monday that the listing for the home in Melrose, a suburb of Boston, is evidence of how hot the housing market is. In August, industry groups listed the median sale price of single-family homes in the state to be between $535,000 and $552,000. The online listing for the burned three-bedroom, 1,857-square foot home starts with a call out to contractors, and continues: “House is in need of a complete renovation or potential tear down and rebuild. Buyer to do due diligence. House being sold as is.” The house suffered an intense fire in August that blew out the front windows, which are now boarded up. The Boston Globe reported that firefighters had to tear out parts of the walls and ceiling of the home to extinguish the blaze.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A young Detroit-area man who snapped a photo of a gang chart while cleaning an FBI office and posted it on social media was sentenced Tuesday to probation. Publicizing the chart could have caused a “bloodbath,” said U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. Parker said it was a serious case, but she turned down the government’s request that Anthony Cassani be locked up for three months. “I don’t think you need to be incarcerated to understand the gravity of what you’ve done here,” the judge said. In 2020, Cassani, 22, was cleaning an FBI office to reduce the risk of COVID-19 when he saw a chart of Detroit gang members. He admits taking a picture of the chart with his phone and posting it on Snapchat. It could have gone “horribly wrong” if “search warrants were executed and the targets of the search warrant were prepared for the agents to come in,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Eaton Brown said. “We’re thankful that’s not what happened.” Cassani pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. He apologized and acknowledged the potential harm.\n\nMinnesota\n\nChaska: Tensions at a suburban Twin Cities school board meeting over a new mask mandate escalated to a physical scuffle. The Eastern Carver County Schools said Monday all students would need to wear a mask through at least the middle of next month because of a rise in coronavirus cases. At a meeting Monday night in Chaska, speakers lined up to talk about their support or opposition to the mandate. A couple of men got physical over what appeared to be a disagreement about someone taking a photo. Several other men intervened to separate the two and police were summoned, video from WCCO-TV showed. Some parents said the mask mandate is causing bullying concerns on both sides of the issue. Many parents said they want some sort of protocol about what they should do if their child is exposed, and if there is a required quarantine period.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: Three Mississippi cities and Birmingham, Alabama have been awarded grants to improve their train stations ahead of the planned return of Amtrak service to the Gulf Coast. Bay St. Louis, Gulfport and Pascagoula received a little more than $700,000 total, and another $250,000 went to Birmingham, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported. The newspaper said the grants were announced Monday by the Southern Rail Commission. The money will fund improvements to amenities such as lighting, sidewalks and parking areas. The grants require an equivalent matching contribution from local officials. Amtrak said it hopes to resume operating between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama in January. The region has been without passenger service since Hurricane Katrina badly damaged tracks and equipment in 2005. Before that, passenger trains ran between the cities three times a week. The start of service is still pending a decision by the federal Surface Transportation Board on Amtrak’s right of access to freight lines.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A southwest Missouri prosecutor said he has charged five employees of a private Christian boarding school with abusing students – far fewer than the number of charges recommended by state investigators. The five employees of the Agape Boarding School near Stockton were charged with a total of 13 third-degree felony assault counts, Cedar County Prosecuting Attorney Ty Gaither said. The charges came after the Missouri State Highway Patrol investigated allegations of abuse at the school. Based on that investigation, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt recommended prosecuting 22 employees with 65 counts on behalf of 36 victims, including felonies for abuse of a child and tampering with a victim, and misdemeanors for endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report child abuse. After Gaither said last week that he planned to charge far fewer employees than recommended, Schmitt asked Gov. Mike Parson to remove his office from the investigation because he didn’t believe Gaither intended to “seek justice” for all the victims. Gaither said this office believed “these to be the appropriate charges under the fact of the investigation,” The Kansas City Star reported. Although Gaither asked for the attorney general’s assistance in the case, Missouri law gives county prosecutors sole authority in deciding what charges are filed.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal authorities are investigating a small plane crash that killed a couple and critically injured their son in southern Montana on Sunday, authorities said. Robby and Pam Stephens died at the crash south of Billings and son Riley was taken to a hospital with critical injuries, officials said. Responders arrived to find the plane on fire in a wooded area near the Blain Airstrip, Yellowstone County Sheriff Mike Linder said. According to preliminary information, the Beech 35S plane crashed at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday, National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson Keith Holloway said. The investigation will include looking at any air traffic communications, radar data, weather reports and a review of the plane’s maintenance records and medical and flight history of the pilot, Holloway said. A typical NTSB investigation can take between one and two years to complete, he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nMaywood: A woman was arrested over the weekend in southwestern Nebraska after being accused of pulling a gun after a store clerk refused to sell her beer, authorities said. The incident happened shortly before noon Saturday, when a business in the village of Maywood called the Frontier County Sheriff’s Office to report that a woman who appeared to be high on drugs pulled a gun when she wasn’t allowed to buy beer, KRVN reported. Deputies and the Nebraska State Patrol later stopped a vehicle on Highway 23 in which the woman was believed to be riding. Officers arrested Dixie Kaiser, 39, of Wellfleet, on suspicion of making terroristic threats. Kaiser was being held in the Seward County Jail on $15,000 bond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Mt. Rose Ski Tahoe is launching the largest capital improvement project in the history of the resort with a $7.5 million expansion that includes a new high-speed chairlift and trail additions to help skier traffic patterns. Resort officials said the expansion including the new chairlift in the Lakeview mountain zone near the Mount Rose Highway connecting Reno to Lake Tahoe is expected to be completed ahead of the 2022-23 winter season. Mike Pierce, the resort’s marketing director, said strong ridership combined with COVID-19 related lift restrictions made it necessary to increase Lakeview’s lift capacity last season. The old lift has been accessing a part of the mountain with views of the alpine lake for 41 years. Improvements already under way include a $1 million investment in snowmaking infrastructure, and slope grading to reduce obstacles and allow opening of terrain with as little as a foot of packed snow, Pierce said. A 60-year-old domestic water system serving the main lodge base area also is being replaced.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging a decision by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s administration to end unemployment benefits under the federal CARES Act early, saying the claims are based on flawed interpretations of state law. The pandemic-related benefits were scheduled to run out on Sept. 6. The lawsuit filed in Hillsborough Superior Court in Nashua against the state of New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Employment Security and its commissioner asked a judge to reinstate the benefits dating to June 19, when they were ended. In her ruling, Judge Jacalyn Colburn wrote “the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims because neither of the statutes on which they rely require the defendants to act.” New Hampshire was among the first to expand eligibility for unemployment benefits when the pandemic first struck. Thousands of people were collecting unemployment benefits, including $300 per week supplemental payments either from the state or a federal program created during the pandemic. The state decided to end the extra payments early because the unemployment rate had dropped and given the abundance of available jobs, Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: A man who apparently tried to break into a restaurant in a southern New Jersey strip mall died after he got trapped in an exhaust fan on the roof of the building, authorities said. The body was found shortly before 10 a.m. Monday at the restaurant in Galloway Township. It’s not known how or when the man became trapped, police said, and officials are still working to determine his identity. Authorities have not said how the body was discovered or who found it. A similar robbery had occurred at the business a few weeks ago, and authorities are trying to determine if the episodes are connected.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The family of a passenger on a hot air balloon that crashed and killed five people in Albuquerque in June is suing the estate of the deceased pilot and the companies that operated the commercial balloon. The estate of Martin Martinez, 62, filed a lawsuit in state district court last week against Hot Air Balloonatics LLC, Sventato LLC, and the estate of the pilot, Nicholas Meleski. The suit accuses Meleski, who had drugs in his system, of piloting the balloon in a reckless manner. Martinez’s family is seeking unspecified monetary, punitive and other damages. A Federal Aviation Administration report showed that Meleski, 62, had marijuana and cocaine in his blood and urine. The National Transportation Safety Board hasn’t ruled on the cause of the crash. According to the lawsuit, Meleski was an employee of Hot Air Balloonatics and one of the organizers of Sventato, which owned the balloon that crashed June 26. The balloon struck a power line and the basket toppled about 100 feet onto a busy street. Hot Air Balloonatics declined to comment on the lawsuit. Also killed in the crash were Martinez’s wife, Mary, 59; Georgia O’Keeffe Elementary School assistant principal Susan Montoya, 65; and her husband, John, 61. Co-workers had chipped in to purchase the balloon ride for Susan Montoya as a going-away gift because she planned to transfer to another school.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of the Catholic bishop of Brooklyn, Nicholas DiMarzio, weeks after a Vatican investigation cleared him of sexual abuse allegations, and appointed a native New Yorker to replace him. DiMarzio is 77, two years beyond the usual retirement age for bishops. Francis accepted his resignation and appointed Bishop Robert Brennan of Columbus, Ohio, to take over in Brooklyn, the Vatican said. On Sept. 1, the New York church announced that the Vatican had closed its case against DiMarzio after an investigation concluded that the allegations against DiMarzio didn’t have “the semblance of truth.” Two men had separately claimed DiMarzio abused them a half-century ago, when he was a priest in New Jersey. DiMarzio denied the allegations. The accusers’ attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, has said the men will press forward with civil cases against DiMarzio. In a tweet Wednesday, DiMarzio welcomed Brennan to Brooklyn and said he had “great confidence in his ability to lead” the diocese. Brennan, 59, was educated at St. John’s University in Queens, ordained in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and made an auxiliary bishop there before being sent to lead the Columbus diocese in 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCarolina Beach: The town’s council terminated the contract of Reef Parking because of defective parking meters and the need for new ideas. Reef Parking manages 1,200 parking spaces in Carolina Beach, including spots in 20 surface lots and 165 metered on-street spaces. Parking fees account for more than $1.9 million of the town’s $16.5 million general fund revenue for fiscal year 2022. This summer, the town fielded complaints about inoperable parking meters, Mayor LeAnn Pierce said. Pierce said she received more complaints about meters not working than about the town’s parking rates. The town will be accepting requests for proposals, which will include reviewing past proposals submitted by other parking companies, Pierce said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The developer of an oil refinery planned near Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota has a new contract with a company that will buy and market all diesel and gasoline produced at the facility. Developer Meridian Energy Group said its 10-year contract with Musket Corp. covers 360 million gallons of diesel and 280 million gallons of gasoline produced annually. The fuels make up 90% of the volume of refined products at the plant. Meridian first proposed the refinery just 3 miles from the park in 2016, with the goal of having it operating by next year. Meridian says the Billings County project has faced delays from the pandemic and litigation from environmental groups, and the company has struggled to secure financing. Environmentalists objected to the permitting process and have concerns about the refinery’s proximity to the national park, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The company announced last November that it had entered into an agreement with Utah-based Kiva Energy, which will purchase propane and butane from the refinery.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Ohio’s utility commission said it has asked an independent auditor to examine whether FirstEnergy Corp. used customer money to pay for naming rights at the stadium where the Cleveland Browns play. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio announcement follows a request on Tuesday by Democratic lawmakers. They want FirstEnergy’s name removed because of its involvement in secretly funding a $60 million bribery scheme to win legislative approval in 2019 for a $1 billion bailout for two nuclear plants operated by a wholly owned FirstEnergy subsidiary. Akron-based FirstEnergy in 2013 agreed to pay $102 million over 17 years for naming rights to the stadium that was called Cleveland Browns Stadium when it opened in 1999, cleveland.com reported. FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the corporation pays for the naming rights deal and not customers of its three Ohio electric companies.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Cherokee Nation and three opioid distributors reached a $75 million settlement to resolve opioid-related claims against the companies. The Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe announced the settlement, the largest in Cherokee Nation history, with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation. The settlement will be paid out over 61/ 2 years. The tribe sued the three companies, along with several pharmacy companies, in 2017, alleging they contributed to “an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse” within the tribe and have not done enough to prevent tribal members from acquiring illegally prescribed opioid painkillers. The three companies said in a joint statement that the settlement is a step toward “a broader settlement with all federally recognized Native American tribes across the country.” The Cherokee Nation’s claims against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS are pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:After more than a year of renovations – and a much-anticipated reopening delayed by rising COVID-19 cases — the Salem Public Library is set to open Friday with limited in-person services. Residents can visit the library for Express Service, which includes browsing, pickup of holds and limited public computer use. The services will be available 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday. Curbside services will continue by appointment, and the outdoor book return is available 24 hours a day. The library closed its downtown location in February 2020 to undergo $18.6 million bond-funded seismic retrofits and cosmetic renovations. It relocated its collection to a temporary location on Broadway Road NE, but the location was only open a few weeks before the pandemic hit Oregon and closed libraries and indoor services. There will be a number of rules in place, including masks being worn over the mouth and nose at all times inside the library and a maximum of 200 visitors in the building at one time.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Allegheny County government employees will be required to submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination by Dec. 1 or face termination under a policy announced Wednesday by County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. About 5,000 employees are subject to the new mandate, of whom more than 75% are already vaccinated. The rest will need to get the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines on or before Dec. 1 to be considered in compliance, officials said. Government workers who remain unvaccinated and who do not obtain an exemption will face termination beginning Dec. 2, the county said. County officials cited the rise of the highly contagious delta variant, which has led to increased COVID-19 caseloads, hospitalizations and deaths, and the need to protect workers and the public.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation has awarded another $450,000 in grants to several more nonprofits that are helping state residents cope with and recover from the pandemic. Centro de Innovacion Mujer Latina, Rhode Island Rescue Ministries and The Samaritans of Rhode Island are among the organizations that benefited from the latest round of grants. Centro received $30,000 to provide community mental health services and other assistance to the Spanish-speaking community. Rescue Ministries received $20,000 to purchase cold storage and nonperishable food containers for its homeless shelter, food pantry and soup kitchen. Samaritans received $20,000 to improve the responsiveness of its digital suicide prevention services. The foundation has now awarded more than $21 million in pandemic relief since March 2020.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A federal judge suspended South Carolina from enforcing a rule that banned school districts from requiring masks for students. Parents of disabled children, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the state saying the ban discriminated against medically vulnerable students by keeping them out of public schools as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The mask ban has been forcefully backed by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster and GOP lawmakers who said parents should decide whether students wear masks, not school officials. U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis compared the General Assembly preventing mask requirements to telling schools they can no longer install wheelchair ramps. McMaster’s spokesman, Brian Symmes, said the ruling isn’t the last word in the case. “The governor strongly disagrees with the court’s decision and will defend a parent’s right to decide what’s best for their children up to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary,” Symmes said in a statement,\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBlack Hawk: More than 150 homeowners in a development outside Rapid City are suing Meade County over risks to their properties after a sinkhole exposed an abandoned gypsum mine. The federal complaint filed Monday by Hideaway Hills residents in Black Hawk seeks damages to be determined by a jury and other relief “allowed by law or equity.” The sinkhole forced about 40 residents from 15 homes in April 2020. Geotechnical studies showed there could be water flowing through the abandoned mine and toward Interstate 90 and there is the potential for future sinkholes, the Rapid City Journal reported. The complaint alleged several violations of the state Constitution. It said the decision to approve the subdivision by the county Planning Commission and the Meade County Commission put homeowners at risk. Developers allegedly informed the county in 2001 of an underground gypsum mine and discussed taking steps to determine if it was safe to build on. The commission approved the subdivision proposal in 2003. Katelyn Cook, an attorney for the county, said her legal team does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin:A house in downtown Franklin that belonged to the grandparents of country comedy legend Minnie Pearl, who performed at the Grand Ole Opry for more than 50 years, is for sale for $2.75 million. The home on West Main Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It belonged to Ophelia and William House,the grandparents of Sarah Colley Cannon, better known by her stage name of Minnie Pearl. The Queen Anne-style home was built in 1873 and sits in Franklin’s historic downtown district. Many of the original furnishings and fixtures remain, including mantels for the six fireplaces. The distinctive home has glass doorknobs and intricately designed door handles. The nearly 6,000 square foot residence sits on a little more than an acre, and has four bedrooms and five bathrooms. Outdoor space includes a wraparound front porch, sunroom, back porch and patio. Hardwood floors are throughout the home.\n\nTexas\n\nHuntsville: Rick Rhoades, 57, was executed Tuesday night for fatally stabbing two Houston-area brothers during a robbery in their home more than 30 years ago. Rhoades was executed by lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the September 1991 killings of Charles Allen, 31, and Bradley Allen, 33. The brothers were killed less than a day after Rhoades had been released on parole after serving a sentence for burglary. Rhoades, strapped to the death chamber gurney, turned his head and looked briefly at relatives of his victims as they walked to a window in a witness area a few feet from him. Asked by the warden to make a final statement, he declined. He was pronounced dead at 6:29 p.m. CDT, 17 minutes after the lethal injection began. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to delay Rhoades’ execution over claims his constitutional right to due process was being violated because he was being prevented from pursuing allegations that some potential jurors at his trial might have been dismissed for racially discriminatory reasons. Rhoades was the third inmate put to death this year in Texas and the sixth in the U.S. Four more executions are scheduled for later this year in Texas, the nation’s busiest capital punishment state.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: The police chief in the tourist town where officers stopped Gabby Petito and her boyfriend weeks before her death has taken a leave of absence. Moab Police Chief Bret Edge requested a leave of absence that began Monday, city spokesperson Lisa Church said. It is unknown if his request is related to criticism the department has faced over the past week after Petito’s body was discovered in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Petito and her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night but no charges were filed and no serious injuries were reported. Last week, the city of Moab said it would conduct a formal investigation into the police department’s handling of the dispute. Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Laundrie visited parks in the West. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A food box program with its roots in the early days of the pandemic is ending after distributing tens of thousands of meals to people across Vermont. In June, the Full Plates Vermont program run by the Vermont Foodbank took over the Farmers to Families Food Box program that was begun by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The original USDA program was designed to feed people left hungry by the pandemic and give those in the food industry, notably farmers, a place to sell their products. The food bank, working with private, state and other partners, coordinated food distribution events where people’s vehicles were loaded with boxes of food containing poultry, fruit, vegetables and dairy items. The Rutland Herald reported that after the original program ended in May, the Vermont Foodbank continued with its version of the program, which has distributed 40,000 meals since June. Sayles said after the program ends Thursday, people who benefited from it can check with the Foodbank to learn where they can get help.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin clashed Tuesday night over vaccinations, tax policy, education and their respective records in the second and final debate in Virginia’s closely watched gubernatorial election. The event quickly got off to a combative start and neither candidate let up over the course of the hour, with each accusing the other of lying to voters. Five weeks from Election Day and with early voting already underway, recent polls suggested a tight race between McAuliffe, who is seeking a second term after his first ended in 2018, and Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer. Democrats made huge gains in Virginia while President Donald Trump was in office, taking full control of state government, but Republicans are more energized and optimistic about their chances this fall than they have been in years. The contest, one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races this year, is also drawing national attention as a possible indicator of voter sentiment heading into next year’s midterms.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: A woman has filed a lawsuit against King County Metro claiming a bus driver ran over her leg while she was laying on a sidewalk and then drove away. Jessica Chapel’s injuries were so severe that doctors had to amputate one of her legs, her attorneys said. The bus driver, who is no longer with King County Metro, is facing hit-and-run charges, KOMO-TV reported. Chapel was homeless in March and decided to lay down on the sidewalk to take a nap, her attorneys said. The bus pulled out of the South Renton Park & Ride lot and turned right, cutting the corner short. The rear tire of the bus ran on top of the curb and drove over Chapel’s leg, her attorneys said. “The injuries were gruesome,” said attorney Kirk Bernard. According to the complaint filed Tuesday, the King County bus driver initially stopped to check on Chapel before returning to the bus and pushing the response button to get help from law enforcement. The lawsuit alleged that the driver left Chapel on the road side and canceled the help that was supposed to be on the way. A passerby called for help.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A new program launched by West Virginia’s Supreme Court that uses technology to promote safety and access in cases involving sexual assault and domestic violence is expanding to Ohio County, officials said. The new system allows victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to file petitions for protective orders without going to a courthouse. Ohio County is the second community to pilot the program, which was introduced last month in Cabell County as a way to address safety concerns. The only option before the program was for victims to appear in person at the courthouse. “This new system will provide an option to victims to help keep them safe from the people they allege assaulted them. We also are ensuring every person’s constitutional rights are protected,” Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau:The city could soon be home to up to 85 refugees, including some of the thousands of evacuees who fled the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The Ethiopian Community Development Council announced Wednesday that it is preparing for the first 10 individuals to be resettled into the central Wisconsin city by December, and that another 75 could be received from January through September of 2022. The organization said among those resettled in the community could be Afghans, through the Afghan Placement and Assistance program. The organization received authorization for the resettlement from the Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, but no costs have yet been completed for the effort. Before the refugees can be resettled, the organization is working to hire a director for its Multicultural Community Center and raise funds to hire other local staff members, according to a release. As soon as staff members are in place, the group will work with local partners to prepare for the first arrivals.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Widespread news coverage of Gabby Petito helped searchers in an unrelated case find a man’s body not far away, officials said. A team with a search dog looked for four hours Tuesday before finding the body of a man matching the description of Robert ‘Bob’ Lowery, according to a Teton County Search & Rescue statement. Lowery, 46, of Houston, went missing Aug. 20. The man’s body was found on a steep, wooded slope in the area of Teton Pass in western Wyoming. How the man died wasn’t immediately known. Authorities notified Lowery’s family while awaiting confirmation the body was his. News coverage of Petito, 22, who went missing on a cross-country road trip and whose body was found near Grand Teton National Park on Sept. 19, sometimes mentioned Lowery’s disappearance. That prompted at least two people to call authorities with information about Lowery, searchers said Tuesday. Lowery was wearing a black baseball cap with a gold letter “P” and spotted in hotel camera images carrying a black duffel bag with the Nike logo. Searchers in the area of a popular canyon trail said they found a bag matching that description with the body, far off the trail. The bag contained a tent and sleeping bag, Lowery’s sister, Leigh, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. The Teton Pass-area canyon where the man’s body was found is about 45 miles from where Petito was found. Petito’s parents reported her missing Sept. 11 after she didn’t respond to calls and texts while she and boyfriend Brian Laundrie visited national parks in the West.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/21/hollywood-home-water-shutoff-saliva-tests-sturgis-worries-news-around-states/113411612/", "title": "50 States - USA Today", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAug. 21, 2020, 3:44 a.m. ET\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Auburn University said a number of students are quarantined after four COVID-19 cases were reported in a campus residence hall and a fraternity house, a university spokesman said Wednesday. “Auburn is aware of multiple students who have tested positive for COVID-19 in a campus residence hall and a fraternity house. The university has taken immediate action to quarantine the impacted students and is going above and beyond all guidance from public health officials,” spokesman Preston Sparks wrote in an email to the Associated Press. Sparks in a follow-up email said it involved four COVID-19 cases. The school did not name the fraternity or dorm. The university said that 32 students and eight employees tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Sparks said the students will remain quarantined until each has received medical clearance. The students will complete coursework remotely while quarantined. Auburn has about 30,000 students on its main campus. The university is requiring face coverings, both indoors and outdoors on campus, and has taken other steps to try to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The University of Alaska Anchorage will drop its men’s hockey program and three other sports next year because of significant reductions in state funding, the university said Wednesday. The school also will cut men’s and women’s skiing and women’s gymnastics. The moves will save about $2.5 million a year, chancellor Cathy Sandeen said. “This comes at a difficult time as they are already facing much uncertainty surrounding this year’s season due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Sandeen said. The Seawolves will go from sponsoring 13 sports to nine. The hockey team began play in 1979. The ski program dates to 1970, and the Seawolves have had nine skiers win national championships. About 55 athletes, seven coaches and two athletic department staff members are impacted. Travel to the Lower 48 states for competitions exacerbated the athletic department’s financial woes. Recent budget issues made the situation untenable.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizona’s downward trend of coronavirus cases means parts of the state could meet all three metrics the state’s health and education departments set for at least a partial reopening of schools by Labor Day, according to a former state health director. And bars and nightclubs in at least some counties could meet the parameters for reopening shortly after that, according to Will Humble, who now leads the Arizona Public Health Association. But caution is the word of the day, according to Humble and Dr. Joshua LaBaer, executive director of the ASU Biodesign Institute, which has been tracking the virus in Arizona. “Arizona continues on what I would consider a positive trend, a good trend for us,” LaBaer said Wednesday at his weekly media briefing. Humble credited local government officials for requiring masks and gives the Republican governor credit for closing bars. The third element in the case drop, he believes, is some level of so-called “herd immunity” that came from lots of people being infected.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas is seeking $300 in additional weekly federal unemployment benefits, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday as the state reported 729 new confirmed coronavirus cases. Hutchinson said the state is submitting its application to the federal government for the unemployment extension. He said state lawmakers are also reviewing the request. Arkansas is the latest state to seek the extended benefits under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump this month. Congress approved payments of $600 a week at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, but those benefits expired Aug. 1 and Congress has been unable to agree on an extension. Hutchinson opted against seeking $400 in weekly benefits, which would have required the state to pay a quarter of the cost. Hutchinson has said that would cost $265 million and would require tapping into coronavirus relief money the state has received that’s already been allocated for other programs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that he authorized shutting off utility services at a home in the Hollywood Hills that has been the site of raucous parties despite a ban on large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “Despite several warnings, this house has turned into a nightclub in the hills, hosting large gatherings in flagrant violation of our public health orders,” Garcetti said. “The city has now disconnected utilities at this home to stop these parties that endanger our community.” The city did not identify the home’s address or the owner. Garcetti announced earlier this month that he would ask the city’s Department of Water and Power to shut off service to houses and businesses hosting parties. With bars closed in town, large house parties can become “superspreaders” of COVID-19, Garcetti said. The announcement came days after an Aug. 3 party at a mansion where hundreds of people gathered without masks or social distancing. The party ended in a shooting that killed a woman and wounded two other people.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo:With the looming start of the 2020 Colorado State Fair, Pueblo County’s COVID-19 testing site will be temporarily relocated. The Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said the site will move while the expo is in session, and an announcement about where the new site will be will be made soon. The site will be moved from Monday through Sept. 9, according to the health department. Testing will remain from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The testing site is expected to move back to the fairgrounds once the state fair has ended. The site opened in April and 8,652 tests have been conducted there. There have been a total of 14,369 COVID-19 tests completed in Pueblo County to date. The fair runs from Aug. 28-31.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: University of Connecticut officials have evicted several students from on-campus housing after learning of a crowded dormitory room party with no mask-wearing or social distancing, which violated the school’s coronavirus rules. School officials notified the campus community of the disciplinary actions and investigations in a letter Tuesday night. Students began returning to campus Aug. 14, all were tested for the virus and all were supposed to limit their contact with others during their first 14 days back on campus. Video of the party was posted on social media. “Students were not wearing masks, closely assembled, and endangering not only their own health and well-being, but that of others at a time when UConn is working to protect our community and resume classes in the context of a deadly global pandemic,” said the letter sent by Eleanor Daugherty, associate vice president and dean of students, and Pamela Schipani, executive director of residential life. Temporary disciplinary action was taken against an undisclosed number of students and they were removed from student housing pending a school investigation, they said. Many colleges have changed course and moved all undergraduate classes online as schools struggle to contain outbreaks and students continue to gather in large groups without masks or social distancing. UConn officials, however, said there is no outbreak at the Storrs campus and the students’ actions were not representative of the entire student body, most of which has been following the coronavirus protocols. About 5,000 students are on campus.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware and New Castle County are giving out $100million in grants for small businesses and nonprofits in the state. The program known as DE Relief Grants, which was announced on Wednesday afternoon, will provide grants ranging from $30,000 to $100,000 to 3,000 small businesses and nonprofits, according to a news release from Gov. John Carney's office. Organizations can use the money to buy equipment such as PPE, air purifiers or plexiglass to make the workplace safer during the COVID-19 pandemic; refinance debt incurred because of COVID-19, including the state's HELP loans; advertise efforts undertaken as a result of COVID-19; and fix expenses accrued during COVID-19. The size of the grant will depend on the organization's 2019 revenue. The Division of Small Business is administering the program and will start accepting applications in early September at business.delaware.gov/relief.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:As of Wednesday, 600 people have died from COVID-19 in the District of Columbia, WUSA-TV reported. The District reported 29 new cases of the coronavirus – its lowest daily number of cases since July 4. D.C. health has now reported successfully contact tracing more than 90% of new coronavirus cases for 60 consecutive days.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:With more than 28% of Florida voters casting ballots, Tuesday’s pandemic-shaded elections drew the largest state primary turnout in 18 years – setting the stage for what could be another record in November. The primary can prove a tough sell to voters, but almost 3.9 million cast ballots in the primary – almost 1 million more than during 2016 presidential year. The turnout also was the largest in a presidential year Florida primary since 1992, when 35% of voters cast ballots. About 1.1 million people voted at the polls on Tuesday.Much of the primary turnout increase was powered by the 2.3 million vote-by-mail ballots submitted, which represented about 59% of all votes cast.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp defended his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in fiery remarks Wednesday after a report from the White House coronavirus task force said Georgia led the nation last week in new cases per capita. The White House report, dated Sunday, recommends several steps to curb the virus that Kemp has declined to take, including closing bars and issuing mask mandates in counties with 50 or more active cases. Kemp was among the first governors to ease earlier restrictions this spring, and although infections declined for weeks afterward, they began to rise in June and peaked in late July. First reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the report said “Georgia’s small gains are fragile and statewide progress will require continued, expanded, and stronger mitigation efforts, including in all open schools.” Kemp insisted Wednesday that other markers he’s watching paint a different picture. The report from the White House coronavirus task force says that last week Georgia had 216 new cases per 100,000 residents, compared to the national average of 112 new cases per 100,000 residents. State health officials say more than 243,000 people in Georgia have contracted the virus and at least 4,849 people have died from COVID-19.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii attorney general’s office denies threatening a Republican state House of Representatives candidate with arrest for violating a traveler quarantine mandated to protect the islands from the spread of the coronavirus. Lori Ford was in California visiting family when Hawaii’s 14-day quarantine on arriving travelers went into effect in March. She returned in May to file candidacy papers and then returned to California. Agents from the Hawaii attorney general’s office contacted her and told her she would be arrested for violating the quarantine, Ford and her attorney Bilal Essayli said. Because of that threat, she remains in California. “Our office has communicated with Ms. Ford’s attorney, and we informed him that if Ms. Ford were charged, we would contact him so he could assist her in receiving the Complaint and a penal summons to appear in court,” Krishna Jayaram, spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said in a statement. “These communications did not contemplate or threaten Ms. Ford with arrest should she return to Hawaii.” Ford said she didn’t attempt to seek an exemption to the quarantine so that she could file her candidacy papers. Essayli said she was required to appear in person at the elections office by June 2. However, Nedielyn Bueno of the state Office of Elections said Wednesday a candidate is not required to file candidacy papers in person. “Candidates may have a representative deliver or submit the required documents by mail,” she said. Authorities have routinely arrested tourists and returning residents for violating the quarantine.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday called the part-time Legislature back into a special session because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor in a news release said the special session will start Monday. He said lawmakers will consider election law changes as well as establishing temporary civil liability standards related to the pandemic. Lawmakers meeting in special working groups comprised of senators and representatives from both parties have been calling for a special session to address those two issues. Election officials have testified before those lawmakers that polling places for the November election could be limited because of a lack of volunteers afraid of getting the virus and some facilities declining to be polling places. That has led to suggestions of polling centers with expanded voting times as well as using National Guard soldiers at polling places. Election officials have also sought changes in the absentee ballot system to make vote counting more efficient due to possibly much larger numbers of absentee ballots. Another group of lawmakers said that a liability shield law is needed to protect government, schools and private businesses from frivolous lawsuits. Lawmakers said that if someone gets the virus at a school or workplace, they could file a lawsuit. But others said such a liability shield would remove responsibility from businesses, schools and government.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker touted a University of Illinois saliva test on Wednesday as a potential “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19. The test, which involves spitting into a test tube, can offer results in hours and is expected to cost about $10. The university has performed more than 50,000 tests since making it available at no cost to faculty, staff and students last month. University officials said Wednesday that the test had become the latest to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The university expects to test up to 20,000 students at a day when the fall semester begins next week and students will be required to be tested twice a week. Pritzker said there are possibilities for the tests to be used statewide, particularly for K-12 schools. “If ongoing research continues to yield positive results, this has potentially game-changing implications for our statewide testing complex as well as for testing on a national level,” Pritzker said. “The potential here is enormous.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State officials are working to develop a public website that will track the number of coronavirus cases among students, teacher and other employees at Indiana’s K-12 schools. Dr. Kristina Box, the state health commissioner, said her goal was to have the website available by mid- to late September and that the information would broken down by individual school. The public tracking system is being developed as school districts across the state have struggled with reopening decisions. Gov. Eric Holcomb and state health officials have declined to set benchmarks for the circumstances when schools should close their doors to students. Several of the state’s largest school districts have started the academic year with only online classes. Some opened with in-person classes only to backtrack after facing coronavirus cases.\n\nIowa\n\nCoralville: An increase in coronavirus cases prompted Iowa prison officials on Wednesday to stop admitting inmates from county jails to the Iowa Medical and Classification Center in Coralville. The Department of Corrections said 59 inmates tested positive in the last week out of nearly 800 tests conducted at the center. When officials believe the virus is no longer spreading in the facility, it will end the suspension. Staff implemented enhanced quarantine and testing measures after an inmate tested positive for the coronavirus last week. Inmates typically are temporarily assigned to the center before being sent to another prison in Iowa’s system. The Coralville center usually admits about 65 inmates a week from jails.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: University of Kansas Chancellor Douglas Girod is seeking permission to obtain a $20 million, short-term line of credit in case the coronavirus pandemic significantly modifies the 2020 football and basketball seasons. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that Girod said in an email calling an emergency meeting of the governing board that oversees Kansas Athletics that the line of credit is just to provide “emergency liquidity.” Girod said the credit would also allow Kansas athletics to continue its operations in such a scenario without having to ask the university for financial assistance. The university is facing a budgeting shortfall of at least $120 million on its own during the current fiscal year. The meeting will take place through a group email, with the results of each board member’s vote made public. Votes must be submitted by 5 p.m. Friday. Girod, as chairman of the board, also requested that members give University of Kansas Athletic Director Jeff Long permission to refinance nearly $30 million in outstanding bond debt. If board members allow Long to undertake the financial restructuring, both the refinanced bond debt and emergency line of credit will be up for a final discussion and vote at the board’s September meeting.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has ruled that the state cannot force religious schools to close as long as they are following health recommendations put in place to protect against the coronavirus. Cameron wrote in the Wednesday opinion that a forced closure of religious schools by Gov. Andy Beshear would violate the U.S. Constitution and state law, news outlets reported. When asked about the opinion, Beshear said Wednesday that “nobody is trying to close any school that is complying with guidelines and preventing outbreaks.” “I don’t know where that came from,” the Courier-Journal quoted him as saying. Republican state Sen. Wil Schroder requested the opinion, according to the ruling. Cameron said in a statement that religious schools were protected by the Constitution, even during the pandemic. “Religiously affiliated schools are an important extension of faith for many Kentucky families, and the state cannot prevent them from operating so long as necessary health precautions are observed,” according to the statement. The opinion comes after Beshear recommended Kentucky schools begin the year with online learning until Sept. 28 to give more time to bring a recent surge in virus cases under control. The Archdiocese of Louisville and other religious schools, as well as some public districts, have decided to move ahead with or have already begun reopening for in-person classes, the newspaper said. Others have said they plan to start virtually.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As college students return to campus, Gov. John Bel Edwards is urging them to take precautions against the coronavirus, worried the schools could undercut recent progress the state has made in fighting the pandemic. Louisiana continued Wednesday to have one of the nation’s highest per capita virus infection rates in recent weeks. But the average number of new confirmed cases per day has fallen by more than 50% over the past 14 days, to about 1,000. The number of people hospitalized with the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus also has significantly declined. But elementary and secondary schools started opening this month, and move-in days began last week at Louisiana’s universities, raising fears of a new spike in COVID-19 just as the state is making strides to contain its second surge of the disease. “This is going to be a lot more movement, a lot more activity and people coming into contact with one another than we have seen on our campuses since March … so we have to be especially vigilant right now,” Edwards said. Louisiana’s universities are planning to hold classes through a mix of in-person and online learning, with a wary eye toward the experiences in other states. Edwards is asking college students to wear masks as the state requires, maintain social distancing and to “think twice about going” to a party or event if it will be packed with people not following those rules.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The largest school district in Maine has approved a plan for the upcoming school year that will mix in-person learning with remote instruction. The Portland Board of Public Education unanimously approved the proposal on Wednesday. The school year will begin on Sept. 14. The proposal calls for elementary students to return to school full-time on Oct. 13. The possibility of more in-person learning for middle-schoolers is scheduled to be reassessed after the first trimester, school officials said. The plan also calls for students in grades 10 through 12 to take courses remotely four days a week and receive in-person instruction in a learning center one day a week. District officials said they hope to “maximize in-person learning time for students in grades 10-12 starting in October.” The district has more than 6,700 students.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Multiple Maryland inmates have filed federal lawsuits alleging a leak spilled sewage into cells for days and that rules meant to protect against the coronavirus are being repeatedly ignored in state facilities. Baltimore County inmates Keith Wiggins and Reginald Dorsey said in separate complaints filed last week in U.S. District Court that they were forced to sit in dirty jails without running water for at least four days in April, The Baltimore Sun reported Thursday, citing the lawsuits.The men said staff members were slow in responding, and when they did, they shut off the water in the cells and kept inmates locked inside. The allegations join those that were contained in several other federal complaints recently filed against the Baltimore County Detention Center. Inmates are seeking damages and asking the court to address what they said are chronic health and safety issues, as well as repeated violations of coronavirus guidelines. Another inmate, Renardo Whitehead, alleged in a separate federal lawsuit that he asked for a coronavirus test several times and was denied. He added that staff has ignored social distancing orders, allowing groups of nearly 20 people to congregate. Other inmates accused prison officials of failing to provide proper access to protective equipment and overlooking mask mandates. The Director of the Baltimore County Department of Corrections contended the department has been following safety measures.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston:Ten people who work at a Massachusetts courthouse have tested positive for the coronavirus, and the building will remain closed until further notice, according to a court official. In addition to the 10 employees at New Bedford District Court who tested positive, 25 have tested negative for the disease and additional test results are pending, trial court spokeswoman Jennifer Donahue told The Standard-Times. The facility closed for cleaning and disinfecting last week after an employee tested positive for COVID-19. Donahue said in an email Wednesday that court officials do not yet have a reopening date for the public. “The Trial Court is analyzing the protocol in response to this situation and working with the Department of Public Health,” she said, “There are still virtual hearings going on, and in-person matters for New Bedford are currently taking place in Fall River.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday that her administration is assessing the risk of reopening Michigan businesses that have been closed for five months under her orders to curb the spread of the coronavirus, saying she will have more to say next week. Movie theaters, gyms and indoor pools are among the places that remain barred from operating in much of the state amid the pandemic. The Democratic governor told reporters her office is working with the state health department to “drill down” into businesses that are closed, “where we can do another assessment on risk mitigation and determine if we might consider making some improvements in the policy.” Whitmer said other states have taken “bad” steps that “we don’t want to do,” but there are “perhaps some things that they have done and been successful.” She has come under criticism from the owners of theaters and fitness clubs – which are now open with capacity restrictions in many other states – for letting Detroit casinos reopen at 15% capacity about two weeks ago while keeping their businesses shut except in northern counties. Other closed operations including amusement parks, arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor climbing centers, indoor dance areas, skating rinks, trampoline parks, water parks and other similar recreational or entertainment facilities.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Minnesota’s unemployment rate fell to 7.7% in July from 8.6% a month earlier, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development said Thursday, but cautioned that job growth is slowing as the coronavirus pandemic persists. The agency said Minnesota added 32,500 payroll jobs in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, while the U.S. added 1.8 million jobs in July. The U.S. unemployment rate was 10.2% for July, down from 11.1% in June. “We’re moving in the right direction, but job growth is slowing, a sign that this recovery will likely take some time,” DEED Commissioner Steve Grove said in a statement. Minnesota’s unemployment rate was 2.9% before the pandemic struck, according to the department’s revised figures. Some groups of Minnesotans have been more affected more than than others during the pandemic. Based on six-month moving averages, the agency said, unemployment for Black Minnesotans was 15.3% in July, up 9 percentage points from 6.3% one year ago. For Hispanic Minnesotans, unemployment was 8.6% in July, double the rate from July 2019. White Minnesotans had a jobless rate of 6.3% in July, up from 3.1% one year ago. Seasonally adjusted job gains in July were led by the leisure and hospitality sector, which added 17,200, or 9.8%.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Outbreaks of the new coronavirus have been found at two of Mississippi’s eight public universities within the first days of students returning to campuses, the state health officer said Wednesday. Dr. Thomas Dobbs said cases at the University of Mississippi in Oxford and Mississippi University for Women in Columbus appear to have originated off-campus. The University of Mississippi said in a memo Wednesday that 13 student-athletes and one employee had tested positive for COVID-19. The memo said 11 of the athletes are on the same team, but it did not name the sport. “These individuals were tested earlier this week as part of a mass screening for student-athletes returning to campus and were instructed to quarantine until test results were received,” the memo said. Mississippi University for Women said on its website Wednesday that seven students had reported testing positive for the virus since Friday, and each had been on campus within a week before the diagnosis. Dobbs said some of the Mississippi University for Women cases can be traced to the Cotton District in Starkville, an area with restaurants and bars that are popular with students from MUW and Mississippi State University.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A businessman who went to prison in June after pleading guilty in a pay-to-play scandal that brought down a top St. Louis County elected official has asked to be released because he has the coronavirus. John Rallo, 55, asked a federal judge to allow him to serve some of his 17-month prison sentence under home confinement with family in Salt Lake City because of health concerns, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Rallo pleaded guilty last summer to three bribery counts as part of a scheme involving former Democratic St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger, who pleaded guilty in May 2019 to corruption charges for providing political favors in exchange for campaign donations. Stenger is serving a sentence of nearly four years in prison. Rallo was sentenced in early March but his date to report to prison was pushed to late June because of the pandemic. In an Aug. 11 letter to U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber, Rallo wrote that his cellmate, Taiwan Davis, died after contracting COVID-19. Rallo’s attorney, Curtis Poore, told the newspaper that Rallo tested positive for the virus on Aug. 2, and that he has been very ill and is still having difficulty breathing. He said Rallo has a compromised immune system because he has thyroid cancer and a blood disorder. “No one deserves to be put in harms way and exposed to COVID-19 as I have been for the last several weeks,” Rallo wrote in his handwritten letter to the judge.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Visitation to Yellowstone National Park has increased substantially despite the coronavirus pandemic, park officials said. Visitation rates were higher in July than they were in the same month last year. This comes after the park’s overall visits had been down 49% from last year through the end of June. The park’s visitation rates were down 32% in June compared to the same month last year. The park hosted 955,645 people in July, up about 2% from July 2019. The influx of visitors occurred despite the fact that campsites and hotels inside Yellowstone have drastically reduced their capacity. Just over 1,000 campsites have been used inside Yellowstone this summer, compared with more than 57,000 last year. Park-operated campgrounds have seen 198,500 people this year compared with 380,900 last year. Concession lodging was down 84% from last year, with 72,700 this year and 465,000 in 2019. Backcountry camping in the national park was down by half. Visitors have used surrounding national forest campgrounds or lodging in bordering gateway communities for shelter instead, The Billings Gazette reported. Grand Teton National Park just to the south of Yellowstone also experienced a 3% increase in July visitors. “We are seeing visitors from all 50 states,” said Wendy Swenson, marketing director for the West Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce, who added that most visitors are from Idaho, California and Utah. Yellowstone was closed in full from March to May as a result of the pandemic. Its two Wyoming entrances reopened its doors on May 18. The park’s three Montana entrances followed suit on June 1.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Thirty-five confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Omaha-area schools in the early weeks of the school year, Douglas County health director Adi Pour said. Seventeen students and 18 school staff members have tested positive as of Tuesday night, Pour said Wednesday. Another 152 students, staff and faculty who had close contact with those who are ill were in quarantine, The Omaha World-Herald reported. Pour told the Douglas County Board of Health she was surprised more cases haven’t been confirmed but attributed that in part to the Omaha Public Schools teaching only remote classes for the first quarter. Positive cases have been confirmed at the Millard, Gretna and Ralston school districts in recent days, she said. County health department employees and experts from the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center are working with schools to respond to the coronavirus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A veteran Las Vegas police lieutenant who died from complications of COVID-19 was remembered Wednesday for his police career and for leading a program supporting families of officers injured or killed in the line of duty. Departmental honors for Lt. Erik Lloyd included a vehicle procession on area freeways and the Las Vegas Strip, and a memorial at a church in suburban Henderson. Lloyd, 53, died July 29 at a hospital in Las Vegas in what Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo classified as the line of duty. Lloyd was a police officer for nearly 30 years and was president of the Injured Officers Police Fund for 16 years. He and his wife, Minddie Lloyd, coordinated support for wounded officers and their families. They recently organized a fundraiser for Officer Shay Mikalonis, who is being treated for paralysis after he was shot June 1 during a protest on the Las Vegas Strip. Lloyd was a married father of two with five grandchildren. He was originally from Downey, California, and became a patrol officer in Las Vegas in September 1990. He became a narcotics detective and served in roles in internal affairs, counter-terrorism and use-of-force investigations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Communities can require that voters and poll workers wear face coverings on Election Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, according to state officials. Attorney General Gordon MacDonald and Secretary of State Bill Gardner released a 10-page document Wednesday with guidance for the Sept. 8 primary and Nov. 3 general election. They said they agreed with town moderators that decisions about mask requirements should be made locally given the wide variation in the size of polling places, expected volume of voters and other factors. Communities that require face coverings for voters must, however, provide alternatives for those who can’t or won’t comply, the officials said. Although the officials said they believe towns likewise have the right to require poll workers to wear masks, they also highlighted the “risk of a legal challenge” and urged local officials to consult their attorneys. They noted that some voters might feel uncomfortable encountering unmasked poll workers, and that it might be hard to attract sufficient workers without a mandate. The guidance also clarifies issues around absentee voting, which has been temporarily expanded to allow the coronavirus pandemic as a reason for voting absentee. Municipalities can set up drop boxes to collect absentee ballots from those who don’t mail their ballots – both before Election Day and on Election Day – but the boxes must be staffed by election workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The agency that oversees high school sports in New Jersey has decided that indoor fall sports will be delayed until early next year, but outdoor sports will start their seasons in about a month. The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association’s Sports Advisory Task Force released its “Return to Sports Plan” on Thursday. It features condensed schedules and will keep most contests local. The plan also prohibits out-of-state competition except for “exceptional circumstances” and states postseason play will be limited and local, with no statewide championships. Under the plan, outdoor fall sports – football, cross country, field hockey, girls tennis and soccer – will begin practice on Sept. 14. The girls tennis season will start two weeks later, while cross country, field hockey and soccer will begin competition on Oct. 1. Opening day for football will be Oct. 2. The indoor fall sports – gymnastics and girls volleyball – will be moved to a new, special season that will begin with practices on Feb. 16. They will start their seasons on March 3. The task force noted that if circumstances force the outdoor fall sports to be postponed, their seasons will also be played during this “special season” time frame. Winter sports teams will be allowed to start practicing on Dec. 3, with competition commencing on Dec. 21.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The Albuquerque Public Schools Board voted to extend online instruction through the end of the first semester. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had said classes would take place remotely until at least Sept. 7. The public schools board conducted a survey sent out to all 59,000 parents that said 56.3% of the nearly 14,000 who responded said they were “very uncomfortable” with their children returning to school in person. About 61% of parents who responded said that sending their children back to school in person was an “unnecessary risk.” That same survey found about 29% of the responding parents are thinking about transferring their children to a school that is teaching in-person and just over 34% are thinking about switching their children to home schooling. About 10% have transferred their children’s schools, and just below 12% have switched their children to home schooling. Three public schools in the jurisdiction have had positive cases of the coronavirus. East San Jose Elementary has seen two cases and Hawthorne Elementary and Hayes Middle School have had one each. All three schools are closed.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo dismissed concerns that his state’s coronavirus death toll in nursing homes could be a significant undercount, saying it makes sense to include only those residents who died on the home’s property. Unlike the federal government and every other state with major outbreaks, only New York explicitly said that it counts just residents who died on nursing home property and not those who were transported to hospitals and died there. “If you die in the nursing home, it’s a nursing home death. If you die in the hospital, it’s called a hospital death,” the Democratic governor said Wednesday during an interview on Albany public radio station WAMC. “It doesn’t say where were you before.” Cuomo said if New York were to count a death as a nursing home death and a hospital death, that could lead to a “double count.” “And if I’m a nursing home operator, I say: ‘Don’t say that person died in my nursing home, because they didn’t,’ ” Cuomo said. “‘They died in the hospital. And if the hospital did a better job, they wouldn’t have died. So why do I get the blame for the death when it didn’t happen in my nursing home?’ So it depends on how you want to argue it.” Some New York lawmakers have accused Cuomo’s administration of refusing to divulge the complete count to make it appear that his state is doing better than others on the nursing home crisis and make a tragic situation less dire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain touch-screen ballot-marking machines will remain in use in North Carolina this fall, a judge ruled in a case in which voters questioned the equipment’s accuracy and health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The state NAACP joined the four voters who demanded in April that the ExpressVote machines – already used in roughly 20 of the state’s 100 counties since last year– be barred from future elections. They wanted hand-marked paper ballots used instead. But Wake County Superior Court Judge Rebecca Holt rejected their request, saying no tabulation errors have been reported since the machines were first used last fall. There’s also no evidence their use will increase the likelihood of the virus’s spread, especially with cleaning guidelines issued by the State Board of Elections, Holt wrote. The names of the voters’ choices are printed on the ballot by the ExpressVote machine. They correspond with bar code data that’s also printed on the same ballot and tallied by a separate counting machine.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gerald VandeWalle, North Dakota’s longest-serving Supreme Court justice, is expected to be released from a hospital this week, where he has been recovering from COVID-19. VandeWalle, who has been on the court for 42 years, has been hospitalized at Sanford Health in Bismarck since Aug. 3. The 87-year-old justice said the virus has been much more debilitating than a typical cold or flu. VandeWalle told the Bismarck Tribune that he lost a lot of his strength while being confined to his room. He said he has been keeping up with his work on the court, reading emails and printed briefs and drafting opinions. But VandeWalle said he hasn’t been able to communicate as well with his law clerks and four fellow justices. VandeWalle said he isn’t sure how he contracted COVID-19. He had been working from the state Capitol amid the pandemic and has worn a mask and gloves while shopping.\n\nOhio\n\nMiddletown:A 9-year-old girl who fought brain inflammation, COVID-19 and body paralysis for nearly three months died Wednesday, according to the family's online fundraiser. Dorielis Reyes-Paula, a fourth-grade student, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on May 10 after her mother Doranny Escolastico noticed her walking strangely and dragging one foot. Doctors found brain inflammation during an MRI scan. She was sent home with medication and returned to the hospital on July 19 after suffering from severe headaches and having an epileptic seizure. She also lost her ability to walk. Dorielis continued to get sicker while doctors at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital tried to figure out what was causing the brain inflammation, speech impairment and paralysis. During her stay at the hospital, she endured several biopsies, MRIs, blood tests, and treatments. At one point, the doctors tested her blood to see if cancer was causing the illness. Escolastico said her oxygen levels constantly fluctuated. Escolastico, a single mother of four, started a GoFundMe fundraiser to help cover bills and purchase household items for her other children. To date, the account has raised more than $19,000. The goal was $15,000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: Mayor Will Joyce has signed an emergency proclamation limiting the number of people in bars and requiring people to be seated in order to be served after videos emerged last weekend of packed bars in the city that’s home to Oklahoma State University. The proclamation signed Wednesday closed dance floors and requires tables to be 6 feet apart and all customers to wear masks except while eating or drinking. All employees – including musicians and disc jockeys – must also wear masks. Bars are limited to 50% of maximum capacity or the maximum number of customers possible under the distancing guidelines, whichever is fewer people. The order took effect immediately and is set to expire Nov. 30. Meanwhile, one of the headliners at a three-day music festival in Stillwater called “Weedstock” canceled his appearance after testing positive for the coronavirus. Musician Parker McCollum said on Twitter that he had no symptoms. Stillwater’s mayor has expressed concern about the event, which was set to start Thursday, but he said the venue, Tumbleweed, is outside the city limits. A Tumbleweed official did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment and a recorded message said the venue follows U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that include masking, social distancing and personal hygiene.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Democratic and Republican lawmakers lawmakers said county governments should directly receive tens of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief funds rather than having the state government funnel them to communities. The Legislature has debated how to spend $1.4 billion in COVID-19 money for months, but last week more than half of Oregon’s lawmakers signed a bipartisan letter – addressed to Gov. Kate Brown, Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, and House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland – requesting a $200 million payout that they said had been promised to local governments. “By keeping a disproportionate amount of the funds, the state has created inadequate resource distribution with significant statewide inequities in the amount of aid provided to local governments to help their communities respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the letter, signed by 47 of 90 lawmakers, read. The bipartisan letter specified that according to United States Federal Treasury guidelines, 45% of the funds must be given to local government – about $625 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Republican-sponsored legislation that would give Pennsylvania school districts the final say over whether to hold sports and other activities during the pandemic cleared a House committee Thursday, a day before the governing body for interscholastic sports was to decide the fate of the fall season. With dozens of parents, students and coaches staging a “Let Our Kids Play in PA” rally on the steps of the Capitol in Harrisburg, the House Education Committee passed a bill that would give “exclusive authority” to public and private schools to make decisions on sports, and require them to develop safety protocols. Majority Republicans in the Legislature introduced the legislation after Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf issued a “strong recommendation” that all youth athletics be canceled until 2021 to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Wolf and his administration have repeatedly said the decision on whether to hold fall sports rests with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association and individual school boards. Some districts and leagues have canceled fall sports, saying the risk of spreading the virus is too great, and others plan to play if they get the PIAA’s blessing. Several Pennsylvania high schools have already reported virus cases among athletes, prompting temporary shutdowns of sports programs. The bill passed the committee largely along party lines, though it attracted the support of two Democrats. The PIAA had been making plans to start the season as scheduled when the Wolf administration recommended Aug. 6 that scholastic and recreational youth sports be put off until January.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s slow recovery from the economic shutdown prompted by the coronavirus continued last month as the state’s unemployment rate dropped to 11.2% and the economy added nearly 14,000 jobs, the state Department of Labor and Training said Thursday. The July unemployment rate was down 1.4 percentage points from the revised June rate of 12.6%. The rate in July 2019 was 3.6%. The national unemployment rate was 10.2% in July, down from 11.1% the previous month. With the addition of 13,800 jobs in July, the state has recovered more than half of the 98,100 jobs lost in March and April when the economic shutdown meant to control the spread of the virus took effect, the department said. The accommodation and food services sector accounted for about 4,000 of the jobs added July as full service and limited-service restaurants steadily continued to add employment to their payrolls, the department said. The health care and social assistance sector, which includes dentist’s offices, added about 1,600 jobs in the month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina is joining a handful of universities nationwide to implement saliva tests for COVID-19, as part of its plan to reopen for classes this week. The tests will be free for students, faculty and staff on the school’s Columbia campus, the university said in a news release Tuesday. The tests, which require a spit sample, are an alternative to nasal swab tests and typically deliver results within 24 hours. The implementation of the tests comes amid the university’s attempt to hold classes, which are set to begin Thursday, in person. Other higher education institutions in the state, including Clemson University and the College of Charleston, are delaying the start of in-person teaching because of the pandemic. The University of South Carolina is now the only school in the state to receive state certification for the saliva tests, and one of a handful of universities nationwide approved for the tests. The school said West Columbia-based Nephron Pharmaceuticals donated 50,000 sample tubes and a robot for processing samples.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials warned Thursday that a number of people who attended the 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally this month, including some who came from out of state, have come down with COVID-19. Department of Health officials did not give an exact number of attendees who tested positive, but they said it was below 25. The rally, which ended Sunday, brought hundreds of thousands of people from far and wide to the city in the western part of the state. Even before it kicked off, some locals and officials expressed concern that COVID-19 could spread rapidly at the rally and that it would be hard to track attendees who got infected before heading home. The state’s health department has received reports from other states that people who traveled from the rally have tested positive, state epidemiologist Josh Clayton said. Contact tracers have been able to work with most people to determine who they were around and might have infected. But the health department has issued public warnings for two bars in the region because they were not able to track all of the people at the bars who may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Sturgis is planning to conduct mass testing of its residents next week to stem a possible outbreak of infections from the rally.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State authorities cannot pursue perjury charges against voters who seek mail ballots by concluding on their own that they, or someone in their care, have a health condition that increases their risk for COVID-19, an attorney for the state said in court Thursday. The comment by Deputy Attorney General Janet Kleinfelter came during questioning by Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle as the state and the groups that sued over absentee ballot access continued to argue about transparency in the state’s vote-by-mail eligibility parameters. Earlier this month, Tennessee’s Supreme Court sided with the state by overturning a vote-by-mail option ordered by Lyle for all eligible voters. Afterward, the state removed mentions of COVID-19 from the absentee ballot application. The plaintiffs argued the form doesn’t follow the Supreme Court’s order, which requires instructions for people with underlying health conditions to vote by mail. The state counters that underlying conditions are mentioned on its website and it has sent out news releases to publicize the change, which requires voters to check existing boxes on the form for either illness or caretaking. The state did change its form in another way. A new section on the absentee application offers a reward of up to $1,000 for reporting voter fraud that leads to a conviction. Additionally, the absentee application continues to requires voters to attest to the information they provide under the penalty of perjury.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas on Thursday joined the growing list of states that will pursue President Donald Trump’s plan to offer a stripped-down boost in unemployment benefits to millions of Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced that Texas will apply for federal grants allowing the state to increase unemployment checks by $300. An Associated Press survey found that as of Thursday, at least 25 states have said they intend to pursue the money while two states, Mississippi and South Dakota, have said they won’t. Abbott previously was noncommittal about whether Texas would accept the money while expressing optimism that Trump and Congress would reach a deal on a broader new coronavirus relief plan. People out of work had been receiving an extra federally funded $600 a week, but the boost expired at the end of July. The president signed an executive order on Aug. 8 to extend the added weekly benefit, but cut it to $300 or $400 a week, depending on which plan governors choose. “The Lost Wage Assistance program will provide crucial financial support to Texans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah overhauled crisis guidelines Thursday that could have put people with disabilities at the back of the line if hospitals become overwhelmed during the coronavirus pandemic, adopting a new plan that federal officials said should serve as a national model for removing bias from life-or-death decisions. The changes settle a complaint from disability advocates and set a new standard for other states in removing bias from making potentially agonizing decisions, said Roger Severino, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “When the going gets tough you don’t throw the most vulnerable overboard,” he said. Utah was one of several states facing complaints over state guidelines meant to help doctors and nurses making life-or-death decisions about who gets care if faced with a nightmare scenario like a shortage of ventilators. Advocates said the criteria devalued older people and those with disabilities, putting their lives at risk in worst-case scenarios. Complaints have also been filed in places like Kansas, Washington state and Oklahoma. Five states have settled so far.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Federal coronavirus relief funding is now available to Vermont farmers, sugar makers, meat processors and agricultural food and forest products businesses to help cover losses and costs related to the pandemic. A total of $8.5 million in grants is available and will be distributed to applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. The deadline to apply for the Agriculture and Working Lands Assistance Application is Oct. 1. “Farmers have not stopped working since the pandemic and are providing us with food but many of their markets were disrupted, creating economic hardship,” said Gov. Phil Scott in a written statement. “These grants are intended to alleviate losses and added expenses due to the impacts of COVID.” Applicants are advised to complete a W-9 form and collect records of losses and costs since March 1 that are related to the public health emergency. The Vermont Agency of Agriculture will hold webinars on the application process, with the first one happening at noon Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nHopewell: A prison staff union representative said nearly a third of inmates at a federal correction facility in Virginia have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Wednesday that the outbreak is at the Federal Correctional Institution Petersburg complex. It includes a work camp, as well as a low- and medium-security prisons in Prince George County. Michael A. Castelle Sr., a union representative for the facility’s prison staff, shared an email with the newspaper from a prison official that said that 60 of 187 inmates are currently positive for the virus. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on specifics. Emery Nelson, a bureau spokesperson, told the newspaper that all of its institutions “have areas set aside for quarantine and isolation. Inmates are treated at the institution unless medical staff determine they require hospitalization.” Nelson added that all inmates are managed per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The Bureau of Prisons has reported that 1,378 federal inmates and 592 staff have currently tested positive for the virus across the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday updated his coronavirus proclamation so that it requires agricultural employers to test their workforce broadly when health officials identify an outbreak that passes certain thresholds. Since the governor first issued his proclamation on May 28, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Washington has increased from 21,138 to 67,721, an average of more than 500 new cases per day. Many of the new cases are appearing at farms and food-packing facilities, where employees often work, travel, and live together in close contact. “From the data, we know that people of color have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic, and while we have much work to do to address that, this is one step in the right direction,” Inslee said. In addition, Washington Secretary of Health John Wiesman ordered Gebbers Farms, located in Okanogan County, to test all its employees in coming weeks. Gebbers Farms has suffered a significant outbreak of COVID-19, including the deaths of three employees. “We call upon all agricultural employers to join us in proactively safeguarding against workplace outbreaks,” Inslee said. “When employers are unable to do so on their own, local health jurisdictions and state Department of Health will be ready to intervene.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A child has a rare, serious immune system condition associated with the coronavirus, health officials said Thursday. The Department of Health and Human Resources said the child was the first in the state to be diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 570 children in the U.S. have contracted the condition and 10 have died. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 does not just affect the elderly,” Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state’s health officer, said in a news release. “We must continue to be diligent in our efforts to protect each other by social distancing, wearing masks in public and following all recommendations of local, state and federal health experts.” Forty other states had reported similar cases from mid-February to mid-July. The CDC said a study found many of the patients with the condition had severe complications, including inflammation of the heart, shock and kidney damage. Nearly two-thirds of the cases overall were admitted to intensive care units, and the average ICU stay was five days.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay:Fifty-seven people have tested positive for the coronavirus at the Green Bay Correctional Institution, according to state officials. All of the prisoners who have tested positive are being isolated and anyone who was exposed is being quarantined, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections said. All inmates and staff at the prison are in the process of being tested for COVID-19 with the help of the National Guard. “As we’ve all learned about COVID-19, due to asymptomatic cases, mass testing is the only way for us to identify all persons in our care infected and isolate them from the uninfected,” DOC Secretary Kevin Carr said in a statement. Three staff members are among the 57 positive cases, the State Journal reported. Corrections officials completed a mass testing of inmates and staff at each of its 37 prison facilities at the end of July and just nine people tested positive. Green Bay prison staff have been required to wear masks, except while eating or drinking or while alone in an office, DOC said. Inmates are required to wear masks in common spaces. The only other major outbreak DOC has reported in a Wisconsin prison was at the Waupun Correctional Institution in May and early June, when there were 228 positive COVID-19 cases. among prisoners. All since recovered from the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 67 on Wednesday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 59, the Casper Star-Tribune reported, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update.

In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.\"\n\nPrince William, Prince Kate: The royal couple support King Charles amid Andrew arrest\n\nWilliam and Kate have not made their own comments on Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest, but USA TODAY understands they support the king's statement.\n\nWilliam and Kate last appeared together at the BAFTAs three years ago. In February 2024, William attended the ceremony solo while Kate was recovering from surgery. At the time, William said he had not seen many of the movies that were nominated because he had \"other things on my mind.\" Kate revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer the following month.\n\nNeither William nor Kate attended the BAFTAs in 2025, which were held one month after the Princess of Wales announced her cancer was in remission.\n\nKate recently reflected on battling cancer in a video released for World Cancer Day earlier this month. \"As anyone who has experienced this journey will know, it’s not linear,\" she said at the time. \"There are moments of fear and exhaustion. But also moments of strength, kindness and profound connection.\"\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra and Taijuan Moorman, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2026/02/24/john-davidson-baftas-tourettes-michael-b-jordan-delroy-lindo/88850186007/", "title": "John Davidson condemns racial slur he ticked at the BAFTAs", "text": "Feb. 24, 2026 Updated Feb. 25, 2026, 4:19 p.m. ET\n\nJohn Davidson is setting the record straight on the \"offensive words\" he said at the BAFTAs, which included a racial slur.\n\nDavidson, who is 54 and has lived with the nervous system condition Tourette Syndrome for almost 40 years, felt \"shame and embarrassment\" when \"my tics ramped up\" during the Feb. 22 U.K. award ceremony, he said in an interview with Variety that was conducted over email and published Feb. 24. Davidson also called out the BBC for failing to prevent his verbal tics from ending up in the broadcast, which was aired on a two-hour delay.\n\n\"Tourette’s can make my body or voice do things I don't mean, and sometimes those tics land on the worst possible words,\" Davidson wrote. \"I want to be really clear that the intent behind them is zero. What you're hearing is a symptom — not my character, not my thought, not my belief.\"\n\nDescribing his tics as an \"involuntary neurological misfire,\" Davidson opened up about initially experiencing symptoms that manifested as \"noises and movements,\" but \"the more nervous I got, the more my tics ramped up.\"\n\nHe continued, \"When my coprolalia tics came out, my stomach just dropped.

The majority of people with Tourette syndrome do not have Coprolalia, with a prevalence of 10-33% of people, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nJohn Davidson reached out to apologize to Michael B. Jordan, Delroy Lindo\n\nDavidson explained that \"the most offensive word that I ticked at the ceremony,\" a racial slur that was heard during the BBC's broadcast as Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented onstage, \"is a word I would never use and would completely condemn if I did not have Tourette's.\"\n\nPer Variety, Davidson has reached out to the studio behind \"Sinners\" to apologize to Jordan, Lindo and production designer Hannah Beachler, who said in a social media post that Davidson's use of the racial slur \"was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.\"\n\nLindo told Vanity Fair at a Warner Brothers post-ceremony afterparty that he and Jordan \"did what we had to do\" by continuing to present, but that he also wished \"someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards.\"\n\nDavidson was in attendance due to his executive producer role on the BAFTA-nominated film \"I Swear,\" which is based on his life story. Robert Aramayo, who portrayed Davidson, won in an upset in the leading actor category.\n\nJohn Davidson ticked '10 different offensive words' at the BAFTAs\n\nDavidson clarified that there were several occasions where he'd ticked while he was seated in the audience at the Royal Festival Hall.\n\n\"I would appreciate reports of the event explaining that I ticked perhaps 10 different offensive words on the night of the awards,\" Davidson wrote. He added that the racial slur \"was one of these, and I completely understand its significance in history and in the modern world, but most articles are giving the impression I shouted one single slur on Sunday.\"\n\nHe explained the symptoms of his Tourette's as he wrote, \"I am often triggered by what I see and/or what I hear, and this part of the condition is called echolalia. For example, when the chair of BAFTA started speaking on Sunday, I shouted, 'Boring.'\"\n\nHe also acknowledged \"homophobic tics\" that \"led to a shout of 'pedophile'\" during one of host Alan Cumming's jokes about Paddington Bear, who was one of the presenters. This \"was likely triggered because Paddington Bear is a children's character,\" Davidson said.\n\nWhat happened at the BAFTAs: How Alan Cumming addressed John Davidson's tics\n\nDavidson expected BBC to edit his swearing out of BAFTAs broadcast\n\n\"I Swear\" film distributor StudioCanal was working \"closely with BAFTA,\" and the organization \"made us all aware that any swearing would be edited out of the broadcast.\"\n\nAs such, Davidson wrote, \"I had an expectation that the BBC would physically control the sound at the awards on Sunday. I was so far from the stage. From the lack of response from the early presenters to my tics, and with no one turning around to look at me, I assumed, like everyone else, that I could not be heard on the stage.\n\nHe added, \"I have made four documentaries with the BBC in the past, and feel that they should have been aware of what to expect from Tourette’s and worked harder to prevent anything that I said — which, after all, was some 40 rows back from the stage — from being included in the broadcast.\"\n\nWhat happened during the BAFTAs was \"just a heightened version of my everyday life,\" Davidson explained. Incidents like what happened at the ceremony \"are the reason why, for many periods in my life, I have been fearful of leaving the house — because I am so anxious and nervous about what I might tic and what people’s reaction might be,\" he added.\n\nBBC apologized to Michael B. Jordan, Delroy Lindo\n\nIn a statement issued Feb. 25, the BBC said it \"has been reviewing what happened at BAFTA on Sunday evening.\n\n\"This was a serious mistake and the Director-General has instructed the Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) to complete a fast-tracked investigation and provide a full response to complainants.\"\n\nThe BBC previously apologized for the move, saying that a shout was audible, but the word would have been difficult to make out.\n\nIn an internal memo shared with USA TODAY on Feb. 25, BBC Chief Content Officer Kate Phillips wrote, \"I'm so sorry that a racial slur was not edited out of our broadcast. We understand how distressing this was.\" She added that \"The edit team removed another racial slur from the broadcast. This one was aired in error and we would never have knowingly allowed this to be broadcast.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for what happened. When I was made aware it was audible on iPlayer, I asked for it to be taken down.\"\n\nIn a lengthy statement published by The Hollywood Reporter on Feb. 23, BAFTA leadership offered an apology for \"putting our guests in a very difficult situation\" and explained the events of the evening.\n\n\"Early in the ceremony a loud tic in the form of a profoundly offensive term was heard by many people in the room,\" the organization said in part, apologizing \"unreservedly\" to Jordan and Lindo, as well as \"to all those impacted.\" They also thanked the actors \"for their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"\n\n(This story was updated to add more information.)\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/media/academy-awards-how-to-fix-low-ratings", "title": "Here's how to make the Oscars more watchable | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is Hollywood’s biggest night, and for decades, it was one of the most watched television events each year.\n\nNot anymore. Last year the broadcast experienced record low ratings, bringing in a mere 9.8 million viewers. Just eight years ago, the Oscars nabbed more than 40 million viewers. (The show’s all-time high was 55 million in 1998.)\n\nThe slump in viewership has prompted the Academy to take some new — and much criticized — steps to make the show more watchable, including cutting big award categories such as original score and editing from the main telecast.\n\nSo what can the Oscars do to attract more viewers? CNN Business asked some Hollywood experts.\n\nThe responses have been edited and condensed.\n\nShow exclusive movie clips during the show\n\nMatthew Belloni, founding partner of Puck and host of ‘The Town’ podcast\n\n“The Oscars should be a venue to debut exclusive, original footage of upcoming blockbuster movies. Say to the studios, you have two minutes during the show, and the only rule is you have to show footage of an upcoming movie that has never been seen before.\n\nI’m not talking about trailers necessarily. I’m talking about clips from the movies, and it would air during the show, introduced by a star, not during commercials. Who wouldn’t tune in for a first look at ‘Avatar 2’? Or ‘Top Gun: Maverick’? Or ‘Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’? If there’s a fight among studios for the limited slots, hold a lottery.”\n\nMore reaction shots\n\nKatey Rich, awards and audio editor, Vanity Fair\n\n“Give us more crowd reaction shots! I know it’s hard when half the audience is outside at the bar at any given show, but the joy of re-watching old Oscars ceremonies is seeing which celebrities are seated next to each other, who is conspicuously clapping for whom, who is gossiping across the rows, etc. Ellen’s viral selfie in 2014 should have been proof enough of the true, enduring power of the Oscars: a bunch of famous people in one room, under our watchful eye for three glorious hours.”\n\nKeep tradition, up to a point\n\nNekesa Mumbi Moody, editorial director, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n“People are creatures of habit and we want to see something familiar. So when the telecast changes things like the order of the awards (like the disastrous decision to give best actor as the last trophy of the night in 2021) or not showing highlight clips of the acting nominees, like it has a times (again, like last year), it leaves viewers grumpy. The people who tune into the Academy Awards relish in the tradition of the event, so reward them by celebrating the facets of the show that has drawn them to it, like a great host (or this year, hosts) to guide the show along, blockbuster performances, and yes, faces from the past that warm us with nostalgia.”\n\nNominate more blockbusters\n\nBrian Lowry, senior writer, CNN Media and Entertainment\n\n“The truth is there might be no ‘fixing’ the Oscars if the goal is to make them a hugely watched event again — a horse that was gradually leaving the barn before the pandemic turned that into a gallop. But at the risk of being dubbed a heretic in critical circles, just in terms of making it a more watchable and populist show, nominating one or two popular movies that people have widely seen would surely help.\n\nThat was, after all, the whole goal of expanding to 10 best-picture nominees. You don’t have to name ‘The Dark Knight’ or ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ best picture, but at least acknowledge them.”\n\nSplit it up\n\nTim Gray, senior VP and awards editor, Variety\n\n“I would split the Oscars into two ceremonies. One is the behind the camera people. The editors, the cinematographers, all that. The other is the money categories like best picture and the acting categories … Those [behind the camera] people are really interesting to talk to, so I would give them their own show and give them more time.”\n\nMake it easier for the show to go viral\n\nEric Deggans, TV critic, NPR\n\n“What the Oscarcast desperately needs is something that is almost impossible to manufacture: viral moments that reach beyond the telecast to make people wish they had watched the ceremony when it was happening. But you can make the environment better for encouraging such things to happen.\n\nThat means no more boring montages about the importance of film. That means picking presenters with care, matching them with the categories and encouraging them to say something interesting beyond the canned speeches written for them. It means leaning into the controversies facing the film industry and exploring them, not ignoring or downplaying them. And, unfortunately, it does mean finding a way to downsize categories that casual film fans will not find relevant, so that when big awards happen, the winners feel free to make the most of their acceptance speech and create the kind of moment that may live on beyond the telecast.”\n\nEmphasize the show’s cultural cachet\n\nAnne Thompson, editor at large, IndieWire\n\n“I would lean into the Tiffany patina of the Oscars, and play to the insider industry side of the audience at Hollywood and Highland, by making the show sophisticated and classy, with appeal to grown-ups who love movies. My ideal hosts are good on their feet and know the Hollywood players, such as talk show hosts with comic chops like Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, or Graham Norton, or stars Steve Martin, Chris Rock, and Hugh Jackman.”\n\nStart it earlier\n\nFrank Pallotta, media reporter, CNN\n\n“As an East Coast-based entertainment reporter, I beg the Academy to start the show earlier than 8 p.m. ET It’s a three-hour show that goes way too late into the night on a Sunday. The Super Bowl starts around 6:30 p.m. ET. Why not The Oscars?\n\nYes, I know that celebrities in Los Angeles will have to be at the Dolby Theater earlier for the preshow and red carpet, but L.A. has beautiful beaches and gets perfect weather every day, so they can make this one sacrifice.

Netflix’s film “The Power of the Dog” is among the frontrunners to take home the Oscars’ biggest prize on Sunday night. It would be the first streaming service to win the category.\n\nCritics have hailed “Dog,” a western starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Jane Campion, as one of the year’s best films. It’s earned a 94% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, is most nominated film at this weekend’s Academy Awards and has swept much of the awards circuit in winning major accolades at the BAFTAs, the Director’s Guild of America and the Golden Globes.\n\nThat’s good news for Netflix, which has tried — and failed — to win best picture for years.\n\nThe power of winning best picture\n\nCan \"The Power of the Dog\" finally win Best Picture for Netflix? Kirsty Griffin/Netflix\n\nNetflix scored its first best picture nomination with “Roma” in 2019. The following year it received two best picture nominations with “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story” and another for “Mank” in 2021.\n\nGetting that type of respect from the Academy typically doesn’t come cheap. The Los Angeles Times reported that Netflix spent at least $70 million in 2020 to promote its films to Academy voters. That money likely helped the company pick up a few Oscars that year, but not the coveted top prize.\n\nAnd for Netflix, it does matter. The Oscars may be losing their luster with the general public given that its ratings recently hit record lows, but the show still carries a lot of prestige in Hollywood. A best picture win could serve both as a marketing tool and as an enticement for top talent.\n\n“As the tech outsider this gives them the ultimate form of acceptance inside Hollywood,” Zak Shaikh, vice president of programming at research-based media firm Magid, told CNN Business. “To win best picture says they are a legitimate movie studio.”\n\nApple could ruin the party\n\nCould Apple's \"CODA\" take the spotlight from Netflix this weekend?

The company has already changed the industry, and while some of the old Hollywood types may never fully embrace a streaming service, it’s certainly no longer an outsider.\n\n“Their films have won Oscars, which is big progress,” Tim Gray, a senior VP and awards editor at Variety, told CNN Business. “Netflix is so gigantic… It’s not like they need a best picture.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2026/02/23/paul-mescal-gracie-abrams-baftas-2026-photos/88821311007/", "title": "Paul Mescal, Gracie Abrams at BAFTAs – Couple make red carpet ...", "text": "Updated Feb. 23, 2026, 12:35 p.m. ET\n\nAwards season.

Here's what to know", "text": "Updated Feb. 6, 2026, 10:15 a.m. ET\n\nNASA's Artemis 2 mission has been delayed until at least March due to recent setbacks.\n\nMost recently ,a hydrogen leak was discovered in the Space Launch System rocket during a critical prelaunch test.\n\nArtemis 2 is a 10-day mission that will send astronauts on a trip around the moon without landing.\n\nIt's been a busy week for NASA's Artemis lunar campaign, which has experienced a number of recent setbacks as the agency has again delayed the first crewed mission under the program.\n\nThe launch date for a mission known as Artemis 2, the second spaceflight under the multibillion-dollar program, has been in flux in recent days due to a variety of unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFirst, there was an unseasonable cold snap in Florida that prompted NASA to delay a critical prelaunch test meant to assess the status of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will propel the astronauts on journey around the moon. Delaying the test, known as a wet dress rehearsal, meant delaying by a couple more days the earliest launch opportunity for the mission.\n\nThen, when that test got underway, NASA's ground teams encountered trouble with the towering rocket that raised concerns about its readiness to fly.\n\nSo, NASA pushed off the launch date once again – this time for at least a month.\n\nIt's been a lot to track, so if you need a refresher, here's a recap of what happened with the Artemis 2 mission in the previous week – and what's ahead.\n\nWhen is the Artemis launch date? Moon mission delayed until March\n\nAfter a previous delay, the Artemis 2 mission was due to get off the ground as early a Sunday, Feb. 8 from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nBut after NASA conducted a critical fueling test Feb. 2 known as a wet dress rehearsal, the agency decided the massive 322-foot Space Launch System rocket wasn't quite ready for liftoff. After bumping the mission, the earliest the SLS rocket could now launch on the Artemis 2 mission would be March 6.\n\nNASA, though, has not yet announced an official launch date.\n\nWhy did NASA delay the Artemis 2 mission a month?\n\nNASA's elaborate launch day rehearsal, intended for ground teams to assess whether the SLS was ready for takeoff, ended with the discovery of a hydrogen leak within the rocket's 212-foot core stage. The issue arose while fueling the vehicle with 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant that were later drained.\n\nWill the SLS rocket need to be rolled off the launch pad?\n\nNASA officials have not addressed whether the rocket, which has been vertical on the launch pad since mid-January, will need to be rolled back to the agency's massive Vehicle Assembly Building where spacecraft are prepared for launch.\n\nWhen are the Artemis 2 launch windows? What NASA says\n\nIn early January, NASA identified three launch periods between Feb. 6 and April 6 during which the SLS rocket – topped with the Orion spacecraft the astronauts will ride in orbit – could lift off. Because mission managers have to account for the moon's location in its orbit of Earth, the result is a week of launch opportunities, followed by three weeks with none.\n\nNow that the first launch period has been ruled out, here's a look at NASA's other two launch periods, which include all possible dates for Artemis 2 to get off the ground.\n\nLaunch period Feb. 28-March 13 Launch opportunities March 6-9 and March 11\n\nLaunch period March 27-April 10 Launch opportunities April 1 and April 3-6\n\n\n\nWho will be on the Artemis 2 mission?\n\nHere's a look at the four-member crew of Artemis 2:\n\nNASA astronaut Reid Wiseman , a Baltimore native and the mission's commander who last flew to space in 2014 on a Russian Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.\n\n, a Baltimore native and the mission's commander who last flew to space in 2014 on a Russian Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.

Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen, another mission specialist who will fly to space for the first time.\n\nKoch and Glover represent the first woman and first African American, respectively, assigned to a NASA lunar mission. Additionally, Hansen is set to become the first Canadian to fly close to the moon.\n\nArtemis astronauts leave quarantine\n\nDelaying the mission until March means the astronauts have exited quarantine at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, which is protocol ahead of spaceflights to ensure crews avoid exposure to illnesses.

Here's what we know", "text": "Feb. 23, 2026 Updated Feb. 24, 2026, 6:44 p.m. ET\n\nNASA's Artemis 2 moon mission has encountered another setback, likely delaying its March launch window.\n\nAfter a successful fueling test, ground teams discovered an issue with the helium flow to the rocket's upper stage.\n\nThe Space Launch System rocket will be rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs.\n\nNASA's historic Artemis 2 moon mission has had yet another setback.\n\nA successful prelaunch fueling test for the rocket due to propel four astronauts on their way gave the space agency cause to celebrate. But a day after the test ended, those spirits were dampened when ground teams discovered that not all was well with the towering Space Launch System rocket.\n\nThis time, it wasn't a leak that ailed the rocket, but not enough flow of helium to the spacecraft's upper stage. The discovery of the issue marks the latest setback for NASA's reinvigorated lunar program, which aims to return Americans to the moon's surface for the first time since the Apollo era.\n\nArtemis 2 – the first human spaceflight under NASA's multibillion-dollar program – appeared on track for a March liftoff after the mission last slipped from February following the first preflight fueling test. Under the mission, three Americans and one Canadian are due to fly around the moon ahead of a future moon landing.\n\n\"This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a Feb. 21 post on social media site X.\n\nIf it's been difficult to keep track of all the latest updates, delays and potential launch windows for Artemis 2, here's everything to know.\n\nWhen is the Artemis 2 rocket launch date?\n\nOriginally slated for liftoff in February, NASA officials initially delayed the Artemis 2 moon launch from the Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida, by about a month. The Artemis 2 mission slipped to no earlier than March 6 after NASA's first elaborate launch day rehearsal ended with the discovery of a hydrogen leak within the 322-foot Space Launch System rocket's core stage.\n\nNow, though, NASA simply hopes to preserve launch opportunities in April since it’s apparent engineers have more work to do on the SLS.\n\n\"I understand people are disappointed by this development,\" Isaacman said in a follow-up online post with more information. \"That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor.\"\n\nHelium flow problem marks latest issue for Artemis 2 moon rocket\n\nGround teams at NASA observed \"interrupted flow of helium\" Feb. 21 to the rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage.\n\nHelium flow is required for launch, as the upper stage uses it to maintain \"proper environmental conditions\" for the engine and to pressurize propellant tanks. While the system worked during the most recent fueling test, known as a wet dress rehearsal, \"teams were not able to properly flow helium during normal operations and reconfigurations,\" NASA said in a blog post.\n\nNASA conducted successful 2nd fueling test\n\nThe discovery came on the heels of an otherwise successful wet dress rehearsal in which the SLS was fueled with and later drained of 700,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.\n\nThe test, meant to simulate launch day operations, ended Feb. 20 on a high note after NASA teams didn't encounter the liquid hydrogen leaks that plagued the first such demonstration earlier in the month.\n\nWill the Space Launch System rocket need to be rolled from launch pad?\n\nThe Space Launch System will soon be departing the launch pad, where it's been vertical since mid-January, as NASA is planning to roll the giant rocket back to the agency's Vehicle Assembly Building where spacecraft are prepared for launch.\n\nThe rollback could happen soon, NASA said. An exact time to conduct the 4-mile, daylong trek has not been announced.\n\nWhile a number of factors could be causing the problem with the rocket, \"accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,\" Isaacman said.\n\nWhen will NASA say more about what's next for Artemis 2?\n\nNASA officials have indicated plans to host a news conference \"in the coming days\" to discuss the status of Artemis 2, though a date has not been announced.\n\n\"Please expect a more extensive briefing later this week as we outline the path forward, not just for Artemis II, but for subsequent missions, to ensure NASA meets the President’s vision to return to the Moon and, this time, to stay,\" Isaacman concluded in his online statement.\n\nWho will be on the Artemis 2 mission? Astronauts exit quarantine again\n\nThe crew of Artemis 2 includes NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, as well as the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen.\n\nFollowing the successful prelaunch fueling test, the astronauts had reentered quarantine Feb. 20 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to avoid exposure to any illnesses, NASA said. But amid the latest setback, the crew members once again exited quarantine and will remain in Houston until a new target launch date is about two weeks away.\n\nWhat are NASA's Artemis missions?\n\nNASA's Artemis program is the agency's ambitious campaign to return Americans to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo era came to an end in 1972. Ultimately, Artemis reflects NASA's moon-to-Mars approach to getting the first humans to the Red Planet.\n\nIn the years ahead, NASA's Artemis campaign aims to launch a series of crewed missions to establish a continuous human presence on the moon with a lunar settlement on the south pole. That's where water ice thought to be abundant in the region could be extracted and used for drinking, breathing and as a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel.\n\nArtemis 2 not landing on the moon, but circling it\n\nThe Artemis 2 astronauts won't be landing, but will instead circle the moon on a 10-day trip to test systems and hardware for future expeditions to the surface. The Orion capsule the crew will pilot – built by Lockheed Martin – is due to travel about 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon, taking its passengers the farthest humans have ever ventured in space before returning to Earth.\n\nWhile NASA tested its spacecraft during the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, Artemis 2 will be the first time that the giant, 322-foot-tall SLS rocket and the Orion capsule will fly with humans aboard.\n\nWhen would a moon landing happen? What to know about Artemis 3\n\nA moon landing would take place during Artemis 3, which President Donald Trump has signaled he wants to see happen before the end of his second term. The astronauts for that mission have not yet been selected.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Engineers are now working furiously to find a solution to the coolant issue, with hopes that the rescheduled launch can still go ahead this week.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

It is hoped this will eventually serve as a springboard to send humans to Mars.\n\nArtemis 1 “represents a crucial turning point in NASA’s moon plans”, said CNBC. The 42-day mission involves the inaugural launch of the massive Space Launch System (SLS) mega-rocket, which will carry the unmanned Orion spacecraft beyond the Moon.\n\n“The 98-metre Space Launch System is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built,” said Sky News, “and in this crucial testing phase it will fly further than any spacecraft built for humans: 40,000 miles past the far side of the moon and 280,000 miles from Earth.”\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAccording to Nasa, each of its two boosters generates more thrust than 14 four-engine commercial airliners combined.\n\n“The purpose of Artemis 1 is to put vehicles and systems through their paces before putting astronauts aboard in 2024,” said The Times.\n\nFor Artemis 1, the Orion capsule, which can hold up to six astronauts, will carry just mannequins, including Commander Moonikin Campos, and a Snoopy soft toy to float around the cabin as a zero gravity indicator.\n\nProvided this initial test flight is a success, Artemis 2 will carry four as-yet-unnamed astronauts on an eight-to-ten day mission that includes a fly-by of the Moon.\n\nArtemis 3, planned for 2025, will finally land humans on the lunar surface, with Nasa saying the crew will include the first woman and person of colour. All 12 people to have landed on the Moon, between 1969 and 1972, have been white men from the US.\n\nWhat is the timeline?\n\nNasa is not commenting publicly about the rescheduled Artemis 1 launch but it could be as soon as Friday or next Monday, weather permitting and provided engineers solve the engine cooling issue.\n\n“Launch opportunities are limited by the stage of the moon and lighting conditions upon re-entry, among other considerations,” reported Space.com, so if Nasa misses this window then the next launch attempt is likely to be in October.\n\nNo firm timeline for the next stage of the project, which includes establishing a permanent base on the Moon followed by a manned mission to Mars, has been announced but it is not likely to get the go-ahead until the end of the decade or into the 2030s.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nWith the world in the midst of an energy and cost-of-living crisis, many are questioning the value of spending tens of billions of dollars on sending a handful of people into space.\n\nIt is estimated that US taxpayers will end up paying $93bn to fund the Artemis programme, with Florida Today arguing that the giant SLS “stands at risk of going down as one of the biggest boondoggles in spaceflight history if Nasa can’t find a way to control costs”.\n\nThe Observer said in an editorial: “It is a colossal investment and there are nagging doubts that it is justified at a time when private space companies, such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, are developing giant reusable rockets that could slash deep-space mission cost.”\n\nOthers have suggested it would be more cost-efficient to send robots into space in place of humans, seeing as they require no life-support system and do not need to be brought home.\n\nYet for all the talk of cost-benefits, there are other factors to consider.\n\nThe first is political. “Despite the delays, and absorbing much of Nasa’s relatively small budget by federal agency standards, the Artemis programme has enjoyed strong bipartisan political support,” said CNBC, in part because the SLS development has engaged many different partners around the US and the world.\n\nA map on Nasa’s website shows contributing contractors in every US state and more than 20 partners across Europe. “Keeping those aerospace industry jobs going became a yearly focus for many in the US Congress hoping to boost their political standing with constituents and district aerospace companies,” said Space.com, helping to give SLS and the Artemis programme “staying power”.\n\nRussia and China threat\n\nThere is also concern that Russia and China could step in to fill a lunar void left by the US. Last year the two authoritarian regimes announced a joint plan to build a research station on the Moon, raising serious security concerns among Western analysts.\n\nThen there is the argument that lunar travel “transformed our understanding of our place in the universe”, said The Observer.\n\nNot only did the Apollo missions 50 years ago inspire a new generation, but observations, experiences and images such as Bill Anders’ iconic 1968 “Earthrise” photo “underlined the fragility of the Earth and played a key role in the birth of the environment movement in the late 1960s”, said the paper.\n\n“From that perspective,” it added, “lunar travel can be seen to have provided value for money and suggests there is still something to be gained from continuing to put men and women into space.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/04/artemis-2-rocket-launch-date-delay-nasa-spacex-crew-12/88490132007/", "title": "NASA updates Artemis 2 launch date delay. Here's what to know", "text": "Feb. 4, 2026, 8:01 a.m. ET\n\nNASA's Artemis 2 moon mission has been delayed until at least March due to issues found during a fueling test.\n\nA hydrogen leak was discovered in the Space Launch System rocket's core stage during a wet dress rehearsal.\n\nThe delay of Artemis 2 opens a launch window for the SpaceX Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station.\n\nThe launch of NASA's historic Artemis 2 moon mission slipped another month after ground teams uncovered issues with the massive rocket that will launch the four astronauts on their way.\n\nThe delay, the latest in the U.S. space agency's campaign to return eventually Americans to the moon, is no doubt a disappointment to those eager to see the first human lunar mission in more than fifty years.\n\nBut there is a silver lining: Postponing Artemis 2, which will send three Americans and one Canadian on a 10-day trip around the moon, means that a separate human spaceflight with SpaceX known as Crew-12 is all but clear for takeoff.\n\nNASA had been juggling how to get both missions on their way around the same time, giving priority to the second spaceflight under its Artemis program. A sense of urgency, however, also surrounds launching the Crew-12 astronauts to the International Space Station – which has been understaffed for weeks since an unprecedented medical evacuation.\n\nHere's the latest on Artemis 2, and what the postponement means for the Crew-12 mission.\n\nWhen is the Artemis launch date? Moon mission delayed until March\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission was due to get off the ground in February from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nBut after NASA conducted a critical fueling test Feb. 2 known as a wet dress rehearsal, the agency encountered issues with the massive 322-foot Space Launch System rocket's fueling process. The mission has now slipped to no earlier than March 6. NASA, though, will not announce an official launch date until another wet dress rehearsal is conducted.\n\nWhy did NASA delay the Artemis 2 mission a month?\n\nNASA's elaborate launch day rehearsal began Feb. 2 and extended for hours into the early morning of Feb. 3 as teams assessed whether the rocket was ready for takeoff.\n\nDuring the test, teams discovered a hydrogen leak within the rocket's 212-foot core stage while fueling the vehicle with 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant, NASA said in a blog post. Essentially, liquid hydrogen was leaking through tiny fittings of the tool that pumps the fuel into SLS, Reuters reported.\n\nThe NASA teams weren't able to complete the test, which ended with more than five minutes on the countdown clock.\n\nNASA officials did not address whether the rocket, which has been vertical on the launch pad since mid-January, will need to be rolled back to the agency's massive Vehicle Assembly Building where spacecraft are prepared for launch.\n\n\"For me, the big take away was we got a chance for the rocket to talk to us, and it did just that,\" John Honeycutt, chair of the Artemis 2 mission management team, said during a Feb. 3 press briefing.\n\nWho will be on the Artemis 2 mission? Astronauts leave quarantine\n\nThe crew of Artemis 2 includes three Americans and one Canadian. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, as well as the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen, had entered quarantine Jan. 21 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to avoid exposure to illnesses ahead of the launch.\n\nDelaying the mission until March means the astronauts will exit quarantine until about two weeks ahead of the next launch opportunity. When a launch is imminent, the astronauts will fly to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida about a week prior to liftoff.\n\nArtemis delay opens up window for SpaceX Crew-12 launch\n\nPrior to pushing off the Artemis 2 mission, NASA was balancing preparations for that and one other seperate human spaceflight.\n\nThe Artemis 2 delay ends that delicate dance and means a mission with SpaceX known as Crew-12 can launch much sooner. A recent NASA blog post suggests the agency is still working toward a Wednesday, Feb. 11 launch of the Crew-12 mission, which will send a four-person crew to the International Space Station for about six months.\n\nThe mission's earliest launch window was moved up by four days as NASA races to send more people to the orbital outpost, which has been understaffed since Jan. 15 when the Crew-11 astronauts were rushed home. The Crew-11 mission came to an early end after one of the astronauts experienced a health issue that prompted the first medical evacuation in the station's history.\n\nWhat is the Artemis mission?\n\nNASA's Artemis program is the agency's ambitious campaign to return Americans to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo era came to an end in 1972.\n\nThe Artemis 2 astronauts won't be landing, but will instead circle the moon on a 10-day trip to test systems and hardware for future expeditions to the surface.

Moon mission delayed until March\n\nOriginally slated for liftoff in February, NASA officials have delayed the Artemis 2 moon launch to March from the Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida. Under NASA's current timeline, the earliest the mission could get off the ground is March 6.\n\nNASA, though, has not yet announced an official launch date.\n\nWhy did NASA delay Artemis 2 mission? Hydrogen leak in SLS\n\nThe mission slipped at least a month after NASA conducted a critical fueling test at the beginning of February known as a wet dress rehearsal that uncovered issues with the massive 322-foot Space Launch System rocket.\n\nNASA's elaborate launch day rehearsal, intended for ground teams to assess whether the SLS was ready for takeoff, ended with the discovery of a hydrogen leak within the rocket's 212-foot core stage. The issue arose while fueling the vehicle with 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant that were later drained.\n\nThe rocket, which has been vertical on the launch pad since mid-January, has not yet needed to be rolled back to the agency's massive Vehicle Assembly Building where spacecraft are prepared for launch.\n\nNASA engineers work on Space Launch System rocket\n\nCommitting to a new launch date won't happen until NASA conducts another wet dress rehearsal and completes a prelaunch analysis known as a flight readiness review.\n\nSince the first prelaunch countdown test, ground teams have worked on the SLS rocket, replacing seals where operators \"saw higher than allowable hydrogen gas concentrations\" and evaluating the cause of the leak, NASA said.\n\nNASA also conducted an unscheduled \"confidence test\" Thursday, Feb. 12, in which the rocket's core stage liquid hydrogen tank was \"partially filled\" to assess the area where the seals were replaced, NASA said in its latest mission blog post.\n\nThat test also uncovered an issue – this one with ground support equipment that \"reduced the flow of liquid hydrogen into the rocket,\" NASA said. Engineers were expected to purge the rocket of liquid propellants during the weekend and continue inspecting ground equipment before replacing a filter suspected to be the cause of the problem.\n\nA second wet dress rehearsal has not yet been scheduled.\n\nWho will be on the Artemis 2 mission? Astronauts leave quarantine\n\nThe crew of Artemis 2 includes three Americans and one Canadian. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, as well as the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen, had entered quarantine Jan. 21 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to avoid exposure to illnesses ahead of the launch.\n\nDelaying the mission until March means the astronauts have exited quarantine at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, which is protocol ahead of spaceflights to ensure crews avoid exposure to illnesses. They will re-enter quarantine about two weeks ahead of the next launch opportunity before flying to the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nWhat is the Artemis mission?\n\nNASA's Artemis program is the agency's ambitious campaign to return Americans to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo era came to an end in 1972.\n\nThe Artemis 2 astronauts won't be landing, but will instead circle the moon on a 10-day trip to test systems and hardware for future expeditions to the surface.

The rocket, which is topped with the Orion capsule the astronauts will ride in orbit, was rolled out Jan. 17 to the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nNASA to conduct fueling test, review before announcing mission date\n\nCommitting to a launch date won't happen until NASA conducts a preflight test known as a wet dress rehearsal. After that, mission engineers also must complete an analysis known as a flight readiness review in which they assess a variety of factors, including the status of the spacecraft.\n\nThe prelaunch test, which is on track for Feb. 2 involves conducting a mock launch countdown and fueling the towering Space Launch System rocket with 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellants, which are drained.\n\nAhead of the wet dress rehearsal, ground teams continued to prepare the spacecraft, including powering up the rocket’s core stage, which is what will be loaded with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen during the test.\n\nThe Orion capsule has remained powered for several days, with its heaters configured for the colder temperatures in Florida. Engineers were to begin charging the vehicle's batteries and core stage, NASA said in its most recent blog post.\n\nWhen, how to watch wet dress rehearsal at Kennedy Space Center in Florida\n\nThe wet dress rehearsal is scheduled to take place from around 9 p.m. Monday, Feb. 2 to 1 a.m. Tuesday, Feb. 3, according to NASA.\n\nThe agency, which is maintaining a 24/7 livestream of the SLS rocket vertical at the launch pad, said it will provide a separate feed during the fueling test. Updates will also be made in real time on the Artemis blog during the test.\n\nWho will be on the Artemis 2 mission?

That was before NASA's ground teams encountered a liquid hydrogen leak with the towering Space Launch System rocket designed to propel the crew of astronauts on their way.\n\nNow, it'll be take two for NASA as the space agency eyes another critical fueling test known as a wet dress rehearsal. The next prelaunch test, designed to assess whether the rocket is ready for flight, would come more than two weeks after the last launch day rehearsal ended early and exposed issues with the SLS.\n\nAs of now, NASA is still hoping to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the beginning of March – sending three Americans and one Canadian on a 10-day trip around the moon in the first crewed venture under the agency's multibillion-dollar program.\n\nHere's what to know about the next wet dress rehearsal scheduled ahead of a potential Artemis 2 rocket launch.\n\nWhen is the Artemis launch date? Moon mission delayed until March\n\nOriginally slated for liftoff in February, NASA officials have delayed the Artemis 2 moon launch to March from the Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida. Under NASA's current timeline, the earliest the mission could get off the ground is March 6.\n\nNASA has not yet announced an official launch date. The agency, though, said in its most recent blog post that it found an additional day in the first week of March that would be suitable for a launch opportunity.\n\nWhile NASA did not specify the new date, the previously announced Artemis 2 launch window in March included March 6-9 and March 11.\n\nNASA schedules next prelaunch test for SLS rocket\n\nCommitting to a new launch date won't happen until NASA conducts another wet dress rehearsal and completes a prelaunch analysis known as a flight readiness review.\n\nThe next wet dress rehearsal, a test designed to mimic a launch, is scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 19, NASA announced. During the test, teams will run through the full range of operations that would take place on launch day, including loading the SLS rocket with 700,000 gallons cryogenic liquid propellant that is later drained and conducting a mock countdown.\n\nLaunch controllers are due to arrive at 6:40 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 17, at the control center to begin the nearly 50-hour countdown to the four-hour rehearsal itself, according to NASA. The simulated launch is then targeted for 8:30 p.m. ET, Feb. 19.\n\nThe impending test comes after teams replaced a filter in ground support equipment during the weekend that was suspected of reducing the flow of liquid hydrogen during another Feb. 12 test to partially fuel the rocket.\n\nWhy did NASA delay Artemis 2 mission? Hydrogen leak in SLS\n\nThe mission slipped at least a month after NASA conducted an initial wet dress rehearsal at the beginning of February that uncovered issues with the massive 322-foot Space Launch System rocket.\n\nNASA's elaborate launch day rehearsal ended with the discovery of a hydrogen leak within the rocket's 212-foot core stage.\n\nWho will be on the Artemis 2 mission? Astronauts leave quarantine\n\nThe crew of Artemis 2 includes three Americans and one Canadian. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, as well as the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen, had entered quarantine Jan. 21 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to avoid exposure to illnesses ahead of the launch.\n\nDelaying the mission until March means the astronauts have exited quarantine at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, which is protocol ahead of spaceflights to ensure crews avoid exposure to illnesses. They will re-enter quarantine about two weeks ahead of the next launch opportunity before flying to the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nWhat is the Artemis mission?\n\nNASA's Artemis program is the agency's ambitious campaign to return Americans to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo era came to an end in 1972.\n\nThe Artemis 2 astronauts won't be landing, but will instead circle the moon on a 10-day trip to test systems and hardware for future expeditions to the surface. The Orion capsule the crew will pilot – built by Lockheed Martin – is due to travel about 4,700 miles beyond the far side of the moon, taking its passengers the farthest humans have ever ventured in space before returning to Earth.\n\nThe mission would come more than three years after Artemis 1 launched Nov. 16, 2022, from the Kennedy Space Center, sending the Orion capsule on a moon-orbiting mission without a crew in the first test of the vehicle.\n\nA moon landing would take place during Artemis 3, which President Donald Trump has signaled he wants to see happen before the end of his second term.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Artemis delay prompts ...", "text": "Jan. 18, 2024, 5:23 p.m. ET\n\nThe United States appears to be in the midst of another heated space race, this time with China.\n\nThe delay in NASA's Artemis lunar program prompted some members of Congress this week to fear that the U.S. goal of beating its Asian adversary back to the moon could be threatened.\n\nNASA had hoped to send a group of spacefarers on a trip circumnavigating the moon as early as November as part of its goal of putting astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the last Apollo mission in 1972.\n\nBut last week, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced that the space agency’s first crewed lunar mission in more than 50 years, Artemis II, would be delayed until at least September 2025. Artemis III, the mission that would land Americans on the moon itself, now won't be happening until 2026.\n\nThe setback appeared to unnerve some elected leaders concerned about China's own lunar ambitions. The country's growing space program is actively seeking international partners for a moon mission with the stated goal of putting astronauts on the surface by 2030, Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), chair of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said during a Wednesday hearing.\n\n“I remind my colleagues that we are not the only country interested in sending humans to the moon,” Lucas said in opening remarks. “The country that lands first will have the ability to set a precedent for whether future lunar activities are conducted with openness and transparency or in a more restricted manner.”\n\nInternational Space Station NASA's bold plans to land outpost in the ocean\n\nWhy did NASA delay the Artemis missions?\n\nA battery flaw and \"challenges\" with the air ventilation and temperature control systems of the Orion spacecraft, the vehicle that will ferry Artemis astronauts to the moon, were among the issues prompting NASA to postpone Artemis II by at least a year.\n\nFor Artemis I, NASA first tested the Orion spacecraft needed for deep space exploration in 2022 during an uncrewed flight to see how its heat shield performed under extreme reentry conditions. The heat shield charred more than expected, prompting NASA to launch an investigation into the issue it expects will conclude this spring.\n\n“We are returning to the Moon in a way we never have before, and the safety of our astronauts is NASA’s top priority as we prepare for future Artemis missions,” Nelson said in a statement announcing the delay.\n\nOnce the problems are fixed, the Artemis II crew of NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover and Reid Wiseman, as well as Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen will head out for a 600,000-mile round trip to the moon and back. And when they board the capsule for the 10-day trip to test the capabilities of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and a crewed Orion spacecraft, they'll help pave the way for Artemis III.\n\nThat mission, which NASA promises will see the first woman and first person of color walk on the moon, has faced setbacks of its own.\n\nOnce NASA is back on track in the years ahead, the crew is intended to land at the moon's south polar region, where they will will lay the groundwork for NASA to establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon ahead of future missions to Mars.\n\nBut the delays aren't the only problems ailing NASA. George Scott, the agency's acting inspector general, said in testimony released Wednesday that the total cost of the program could reach $93 billion by 2025.\n\n\"Of utmost importance is resolving technical issues that could threaten astronaut safety,” Scott told lawmakers. “The agency will need to do this while also addressing long-standing concerns such as unsustainable costs, unreliable project schedules, and the lack of transparency into funding needs.”\n\nNelson, however, said at a briefing last week that he remains confident that NASA is still in a position to land its astronauts on the moon before China.\n\n\"I think that China has a very aggressive plan,\" Nelson said. \"But, the fact is that I don't think they will.\"\n\nArtemis retains bipartisan support despite concerns\n\nHowever, not everyone shares that optimism.\n\nMike Griffin, a former NASA administrator who has also served at the Pentagon, testified Wednesday that the space agency's program is \"excessively complex, unrealistically priced, compromises crew safety, poses very high mission risk of completion and is highly unlikely to be completed in a timely manner.\"\n\nMeanwhile, China is a growing space superpower who remains one of four nations in history, along with the U.S., Russia/Soviet Union and now India, to successfully touchdown a lunar lander. Now, NASA is locked in a competition with China to return humans to the lunar surface.\n\n“Our self-declared adversaries, the Chinese Communist Party, together with their Russian partner, fully understand the role that being on the space frontier has in the world of global power politics,” Griffin said. “For the United States and its partners not to be on the moon when others are on the moon, is unacceptable.”\n\nDespite his concerns, the Artemis program established under the Trump administration continues to have bipartisan support in Congress.\n\n“I support Artemis,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said during Wednesday’s hearing. “But I want it to be successful, especially with China at our heels.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Most prominently, the mission will attempt for NASA's crewed Orion capsule to rendezvous and dock in lunar orbit with at least one of the commercial lunar landers being developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, the agency said.\n\nThe moon landing, still targeted for 2028, will now be known as the Artemis 4 mission, NASA said, adding that it will be \"undertaking at least one surface landing every year thereafter.\"\n\nNASA's SLS moon rocket rolled off Florida launch pad for repairs\n\nThe SLS rocket, which was first rolled out Jan. 17 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, recently departed the launch pad for repairs.\n\nGround teams spent hours Wednesday, Feb. 25 slowly transporting the rocket on a massive vehicle known as a crawler-transporter that NASA uses to convey spacecraft.\n\nThe Space Launch System is now back inside the towering Vehicle Assembly Building, where spacecraft are prepared for launch, as engineers work to fix an issue in which helium was not properly flowing to the rocket's upper stage. Helium is required for a launch, as it helps with engine purging and pressurizing fuel tanks.\n\nWhen is the Artemis 2 rocket launch date?\n\nNASA's Artemis 2 mission has slipped by at least two months from the space agency's initial target launch date in February.

Just recently, NASA’s new James Webb Telescope dazzled us mere earthlings with the first images released to date of galaxies eons in the past.\n\nThe planetary systems surrounding us are similar in some ways and drastically different in others. When we look up at our moon it feels singular, but, in fact, there are many moons in the solar system, belonging to different planets.\n\nHere are some fun facts about the other planet’s moons – from Venus, to Jupiter, to Saturn.\n\nMore about the James Webb Telescope: James Webb Telescope photos are dazzling. What to know about the NASA space camera.\n\nWhich planet has the most moons?\n\nSaturn wins out for the most moons, followed closely by Jupiter.\n\nHow many moons does Saturn have?\n\nSaturn has 82 moons. Of those, 53 are confirmed moons, and 29 are provisional, meaning they need to be confirmed by additional observation.\n\nWhat are the planets in the solar system?\n\nNASA lists these as the terrestrial planets of the inner solar system:\n\nMercury\n\nVenus\n\nMars\n\nNeptune\n\nSaturn\n\nEarth\n\nUranus\n\nJupiter\n\nA moon is defined by NASA as a \"natural satellite,\" usually a solid body, without an atmosphere -- though a few, like Earth's, do have atmospheres. The majority of planetary moons likely were formed from the \"rings\" or discs of gas and dust circling planets early on in the solar system.\n\nThe race to the moon continues: Florida coast braces for NASA's Artemis I moon launch, expecting at least 100,000 visitors\n\nHow many moons does Jupiter have?\n\nJupiter has 79 moons. Like Saturn, 53 are confirmed. In contrast though, Jupiter only has 26 additional provisional moons.\n\nA planet bigger than Jupiter?: Images of exoplanet 9 times the size of Jupiter help explain how gas giants are born\n\nWhich planet has no moons?\n\nBoth Mercury and Venus have no moons.\n\nWhat is Earth’s moon called?\n\nEarth has only one moon (as you might have notice if you’ve ever looked upward at night.) Our moon is called just “the moon” because, according to NASA, it was the only moon we knew about for quite awhile.\n\nMany of the other moons of the solar system claim their names from mythological characters. One of Neptune’s moons for example is called \"Triton\" after the son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea.\n\nHow many moons does Neptune have?\n\n14. Neptune has the fourth most moons in the solar system.\n\nHow many moons does Uranus have?\n\n27. With nearly 30 moons, the planet of Uranus has the bronze medal for third most moons in the solar system.\n\nSome history on the planet Uranus: 'Cataclysmic' collision turned Uranus on its side 4 billion years ago\n\nWhich planets have rings?\n\nSaturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all have rings. Saturn’s is the brightest though, and therefore the planet most thought of as \"ringed\" in the popular imagination.\n\nSaturn’s rings are composed of ice and rock, and some scientists think their formation might have something to do with the planet’s plentiful moons.\n\nWhat planet rains diamonds?\n\nThis sounds like a question straight out of a sci-fi novel. Astoundingly, it has basis in reality. On Uranus, Neptune and Saturn scientists believe there is likely diamond rainfall.\n\nOn Saturn, a video from BBC Earth describes a scenario where soot clouds, deep in the planet, reach such a point of pressure that the chunks of soot turn to diamonds.\n\nAmerican Scientist also reports that scientists have believed diamond-rain to be a phenomenon on both Neptune and Uranus, but since the planets are so far away, on the outer fringes of the solar system, it has been difficult to study.\n\nWhat is the brightest planet right now?\n\nAccording to The Center for Astrophysics, a collaboration between Harvard and The Smithsonian, in August of 2022 viewers will be able to see Mars and Jupiter overhead in the night sky (though you might need binoculars, or a telescope.)\n\nThe month of August actually began with a conjunction of Mars and Uranus, the CFA reports, and closer to the middle of the month, Jupiter and the Moon will appear only a finger width’s distance from one another.\n\nWhat do the stars say about you: What is my zodiac sign?

The findings push Saturn's moon count to 274, towering over the previous record-holder Jupiter, which has 95 moons.\n\nThe recent discovery points to what astronomers have speculated for decades, that Saturn's rings were caused by a massive collision about 100 million years ago, researcher Mike Alexandersen, an astronomer at the Center of Astrophysics, told USA TODAY. A collision of such size could explain the small moons that orbit Saturn.\n\nHere's what to know about Saturn's newly-discovered moons.\n\nHow big are the new moons?\n\nThe new moons are only a few kilometers across in size (one kilometer equals roughly 0.62 miles), lead researcher Edward Ashton, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica in Taiwan, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe moons are \"very small\" and \"very faint,\" Ashton said. Because the moons appear mostly as just little white dots on a black background in the photos taken of them, astronomers don't know much about the moons' characteristics yet.\n\nTotal lunar eclipse: How and when to see it in the US for first time since 2022\n\nHow were the moons discovered?\n\nThe astronomy team, led by Ashton, began its research in 2019, utilizing the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, located in Hawaii. The nearly 12-foot optical and infrared telescope is one of the largest in the world.\n\nUsing the telescope, in one night, Ashton took about 44 photos of Saturn over a three-hour long exposure. This was then repeated over three months. The variety of images allowed the team to perform what's known as the \"shift and stack\" technique, in which a series of images are aligned to create a single frame, Ashton said. This helped the team determine what objects were moving near the planet, like stars, and others that were remaining in orbit of Saturn − the moons.\n\nAshton was only able to take photos of Saturn during the new moon phase, Alexandersen said. During the full moon phase, the sky is too bright to take photos of planets as far out in the solar system as Saturn.\n\n\"There will be gaps of 14 to 20 days, where you can't observe, so you have to catch a few good nights in a row and then you have to predict where (Saturn's) going to be a month later in order to recover it,\" Alexandersen said.\n\nSaturn's second moon discovery in two years\n\nIn 2023, Ashton announced the discovery of 64 new moons orbiting Saturn, according to The University of British Columbia. The recent discovery builds on this.\n\nBefore Ashton's research, astronomers were only familiar with 82 moons orbiting Saturn.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAshton said astronomers may begin researching further characteristics of the moons, like what they are made of. However, because the moons are so faint and difficult to see, this will prove to be a difficult task.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Scientists found new ...", "text": "Oct. 3, 2025, 11:48 a.m. ET\n\nNo life has been found on Saturn's 310-mile-wide moon Enceladus.\n\nTthe team of researchers turned to observations made by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close flyby of Enceladus to find new evidence.\n\nSaturn's system is positively teeming with moons, where Enceladus is one of 274 natural satellites orbiting the ringed planet.\n\nThe evidence that an ocean-covered moon orbiting around Saturn could support life just got a little stronger.\n\nEnceladus, a small moon harboring a vast ocean beneath its icy surface, has long been considered one of our solar system's best places to search for conditions suitable for extraterrestrial life – and perhaps, even life itself.\n\nScientists revisiting old data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which ended its mission in 2017, have found organic molecules both new and old originating from the icy jets that spew saltwater into space from the surface of Enceladus.\n\nWhile no life has been found on the 310-mile-wide moon, the discovery confirms that building blocks for it could be present, Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin in Germany, who led the study, said in a press release.\n\nHere's everything to know about Enceladus, the new discovery and the search for life beyond Earth.\n\nWhat is Saturn’s moon Enceladus?\n\nWhile a few worlds in the Milky Way are believed to have liquid water hiding beneath a frozen surface, Enceladus isn't quite as secretive about its subterranean ocean.\n\nThe small, icy world is home to water-spouting geysers that spew vapor and ice particles into space – offering a tangible clue to its subsurface saltwater ocean. From samples that various spacecraft have collected, scientists have determined that Enceladus has most of the chemical ingredients required for life, according to NASA.\n\nThough Enceladus is only about as wide as Arizona, the world is named after a giant in Greek mythology. The surface of the moon is notably smooth, white and reflective, with a surface temperature that extremely cold – about negative 330 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nScientists find moon has conditions to support life\n\nBecause the planet is so cold, most of the material it spews out falls like snow back to the moon’s surface. Some of it, though, remains in space to help form Saturn's E-ring – the second outermost of Saturn's rings – which is where scientists turn to gather observations on Enceladus’ ocean.\n\nWhile scientists have found evidence of organic molecules in the E-ring before, the team of researchers turned to observations made by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close flyby of Enceladus. The probe, which launched in 1997, spent years studying Saturn's icy moons before it was deliberately plunged into Saturn in 2017, ending its mission.\n\nDuring the flyby, icy grains stuck to the spacecraft before they were altered by space radiation in the E-ring. Within those grains, Khawaja and his team found not just frozen water, but the same organic molecules observed in the E-ring.\n\nOther organic molecules not previously detected were also found that, on Earth, lead to life's building blocks.\n\nThe findings, the team said, strengthen the case for Enceladus being habitable – though they are not claiming to have found evidence of life itself. Rather, the researchers claim the evidence they found warrants follow-up missions to the moon to search for signs of life.\n\nThe findings were published Wednesday, Oct. 1, in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nHow many moons does Saturn have? Mimas also has water\n\nSaturn's system is positively teeming with moons, where Enceladus is one of 274 natural satellites orbiting the ringed planet. A whopping 128 of those were just discovered in March 2025.\n\nThe moons range from planet-sized Titan to smaller oddities, some of which are strangely shaped like potatoes or ravioli.\n\nIn fact, Enceladus isn't even the only one potentially home to water.\n\nIn 2024, a French team of researchers found evidence of a vast liquid ocean beneath the icy exterior of Mimas. The revelation means life could possibly exist on a tiny world paradoxically nicknamed \"the Death Star\" – a moniker due to the crater on its surface that lends it the look of the planet-killing weapon from \"Star Wars.\"\n\nNASA, meanwhile, has also sent an uncrewed spacecraft to another planet's moon to hunt for signs of habitability. The Europa Clipper spacecraft is due to reach Jupiter's moon of the same name in 2030 and begin conducting flybys to observe the icy world, where water is believed to exist beneath the surface.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

It used to be known as the planet with the second-most moons with 80, trailing only Saturn with 83.\n\nAstronomers using telescopes in Hawaii and Chile in 2021 and 2022 were able to spot the moons and report them to the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center. Astronomers then followed up the observations to make sure the moons orbit the planet, and that was recently confirmed.\n\nScott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who was part of the discovery team, posted the findings online.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope: Webb telescope reveals icy space cloud containing the 'building blocks of life'\n\nHabitable planet? NASA just found a planet almost the size of Earth and it's in the habitable zone of a star\n\nWhat are Jupiter's newly discovered moons like?\n\nSheppard told The Associated Press the moons range in size from .6 miles to 2 miles in diameter, but only half of them are big enough – at least 1 mile in diameter – to have a name.\n\nThe moons also take a much longer time than ours to orbit its planet. Sky and Telescope reported all of the newly discovered moons take more than 340 days to orbit Jupiter, and nine of them take at least 550 days. By comparison, our moon takes about 27 days to orbit Earth, NASA says.\n\nHow many moons does each planet have?\n\nThe discovery gives Jupiter 92 total moons, the most of any planet in the solar system. Counting the new moons, here's how many moons each planet has, according to NASA (which has not officially recognized Jupiter's new moons):\n\nMercury: 0\n\nVenus: 0\n\nEarth: 1\n\nMars: 2\n\nJupiter: 92\n\nSaturn: 83\n\nUranus: 27\n\nNeptune: 14\n\nSheppard, who has been part of past moon observations on Jupiter and Saturn, believes there are moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn that haven't been discovered yet. He said both planets have small moons believed to once be bigger moons that collided with space debris like asteroids.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The moon is believed to be mostly water ice and have twice as much water as Earth, and there is evidence of an ocean of water or slushy ice beneath the surface. The goal is to see whether Europa could be suitable for life.\n\nContributing: Marcia Dunn, The Associated Press\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2023/05/24/unique-probe-ready-to-slither-into-saturns-icy-moon-enceladus/70252716007/", "title": "Snake-like NASA probe: designed for icy moons with Earthly benefits", "text": "May 24, 2023, 5:15 p.m. ET\n\nThis isn’t your father’s space probe.\n\nNASA scientists have developed a snake-like robot capable of exploring cracks and crevasses on icy moons where liquid oceans are thought to exist – but it could also prove worthy on projects closer to home.\n\nAccording the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory website, the EELS system also known as the Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor is a mobile instrument platform that was designed to explore icy canyons, assess potential habitability and, ultimately, search for evidence of life.\n\nEELS was built to autonomously explore its surroundings and adapt to changing conditions and environments.\n\n“It has the capability to go to locations where other robots can’t go. Though some robots are better at one particular type of terrain or other, the idea for EELS is the ability to do it all,” said JPL’s Matthew Robinson, EELS project manager. “When you’re going places where you don’t know what you’ll find, you want to send a versatile, risk-aware robot that’s prepared for uncertainty – and can make decisions on its own.”\n\nIf it finds a crack in the ice, its sensor-packed \"head\" navigates the break and creates a circular path to make its way down through the crust. If it finds a space too narrow, it burrows and drills down into the ice like a screw into wood. If it finds an ocean, well … you get the point. It knows how to adapt to its surroundings.\n\nScience Objective\n\nThe Cassini probe, launched from the Space Coast in 1997, has provided vast amounts of data on Saturn and its moons. Among its findings, data indicates that Enceladus, one of those moons, possesses a liquid ocean beneath its icy crust.\n\nPlumes of vapor erupting from its surface are conduits directly to liquid water, potentially making this the easiest path to a habitable liquid ocean. Scientists have hypothesized environmental conditions informed by eruption models.\n\nThese models have driven every aspect of the EELS architecture to make it adaptable to the challenges the probe could face on this journey from the surface to the ocean. And the probe’s adaptability opens other destinations such as Martian polar caps, Jupiter’s moon Europa and even ice sheets on Earth.\n\nThe current effort includes working with scientists to identify high-priority, high-impact scientific investigations here that will also demonstrate the capabilities of EELS on a different celestial body.\n\nMission to Enceladus\n\nWhile there is no set launch date for the EELS probe, scientist hope to finalize the robot's concept and prove functionality by the fall of 2024. That means any mission is likely years away from launching, and then you have the travel time. The Voyager probes reached Saturn after about three years and two months. The larger, heavier Cassini probe took longer: six years and seven months to reach the ringed planet.\n\nNASA Study: Oceans likely orbiting Uranus\n\nStill going: NASA scientists add years to Voyager 2 power supply\n\nEELS Architecture\n\nThe EELS robot weighs about 220 pounds and is 13 feet long. It’s composed of 10 identical segments that rotate, using screw threads for propulsion, traction, and grip. The team has been trying out a variety of screws: white, 8-inch-diameter 3D-printed plastic screws for testing on looser terrain, and narrower, sharper black metal screws for ice.\n\n“We have a different philosophy of robot development than traditional spacecraft, with many quick cycles of testing and correcting,” said Hiro Ono, EELS principal investigator at JPL. “There are dozens of textbooks about how to design a four-wheel vehicle, but there is no textbook about how to design an autonomous snake robot to boldly go where no robot has gone before. We have to write our own. That’s what we’re doing now.”\n\nCapability\n\nEELS creates a 3D map of its surroundings using four pairs of stereo cameras and a system similar to radar but employs short laser pulses instead of radio waves. With the data from those sensors, navigation algorithms figure out the safest path forward.\n\nBenefit\n\nThis system can further ocean world exploration by its diverse adaptability to various types of terrains. EELS allows for deeper exploration into areas that were once unattainable.\n\nLook for more space industry news at floridatoday.com/space\n\nRob Landers is a veteran multimedia journalist for the USA Today Network of Florida.

The mission is expected to launch in 2028 to Titan, one of Saturn's moons.\n\nThe Dragonfly mission has faced several delays and expense overruns. Dragonfly has a total lifecycle cost of $3.35 billion, NASA said. The rotorcraft is anticipated to arrive at Titan in 2034 and \"fly to dozens of promising locations on the moon, looking for prebiotic chemical processes common on both Titan and the early Earth before life developed,\" according to the agency's release.\n\nWhat will the Dragonfly's mission be on Titan?

Click here to see them.\n\nWhere is Saturn's moon Titan?\n\nOf the 274 moons orbiting Saturn, Titan is its largest and is roughly 759 million miles away from Earth. In some ways, Titan is the closest moon we know of that is similar to the atmosphere of Earth, complete with its orange haze and methane seas, according to NASA. Titan shows all the characteristics of a planet – including rivers, lakes, clouds, rain and even a salty subsurface ocean.\n\nTitan was discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who named it simply \"Luna Saturni,\" meaning Saturn's moon. Later on, it was renamed after the Titans, a group of Greek mythological beings.\n\nHow Titan compares to Earth in size\n\nTitan is about half the size of Earth. NASA has found Titan experiences seasons just like Earth, but because of Saturn's lengthy orbit, Titan's seasons are much longer than Earth's. Titan is nearly the same size as Mars and larger than Mercury.\n\nHow long will it take the Dragonfly to get to Titan?\n\nAfter launching aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket in July 2028, Dragonfly is expected to take about six years to reach Titan by 2034, according to NASA. On its way to Titan, the spacecraft will fly by Earth utilizing gravity assistance to increase its velocity toward Saturn.\n\nHow will the Dragonfly land on Titan?\n\nOnce the Dragonfly reaches Titan, it will go through a series of steps to launch into its atmosphere.\n\nThe drone will evaluate its surroundings and take panoramic images. The cameras will provide detailed views of the terrain. These will allow scientists to select promising geological targets. Then, the drone will fly in a series of \"leapfrog\" flights to those locations to perform scientific investigations during its 2.7 year mission on Titan, according to NASA. Each of its flights is expected to be about 5 miles.\n\nThe Dragonfly will have plenty of power to perform its many experiments. The drone has eight electric motors and is powered by a lithium-ion battery. A Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), a nuclear battery, recharges the battery during Titan's night.\n\n\"Titan is unlike any other place in the solar system, and Dragonfly is like no other mission,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for Science at the agency’s Headquarters in Washington. \"Dragonfly will visit a world filled with a wide variety of organic compounds, which are the building blocks of life and could teach us about the origin of life itself.\"\n\nCONTRIBUTING Jonathan Limehouse\n\nSOURCE NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, University of Arizona, The Johns Hopkins University, U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy and USA TODAY research\n\nThis story was updated to add new information.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/world/saturn-moon-mimas-ocean-scn", "title": "Saturn's ice moon could be a 'stealth' ocean world hospitable to life", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSaturn’s innermost moon, which resembles the Death Star from Star Wars, may be a “stealth” ocean world, according to new research.\n\nMimas, which is the smallest and closest to Saturn of the ringed planet’s 82 moons, may contain a liquid internal ocean.\n\n“If Mimas has an ocean, it represents a new class of small, ‘stealth’ ocean worlds with surfaces that do not betray the ocean’s existence,” said study author Alyssa Rhoden, a scientist Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, in a statement.\n\nThe study published last week in the journal Icarus.\n\nMimas was first discovered in 1789 by English astronomer William Herschel as a tiny dot near Saturn. The Voyager probes imaged the small moon in 1980, and NASA’s Cassini mission conducted flybys of it while studying Saturn between 2004 and 2017.\n\nThe moon is only 115,000 miles (186,000 kilometers) from Saturn and takes just over 22 hours to complete one orbit around the planet. Mimas is covered in craters, but the largest one is 80 miles (130 kilometers) across and gives the moon its distinctive Death Star appearance.\n\nScientists have long been intrigued by Mimas because it’s likely made almost entirely of ice. Craters scattered across the moon suggest that its surface has remained frozen for a long time.\n\nHowever, before the Cassini mission came to an end in 2017, it detected an oscillation in the moon’s rotation that suggested Mimas may contain a subsurface ocean.\n\nOur solar system is home to multiple ocean worlds, or moons where oceans exist beneath thick ice shells, including Jupiter’s moon Europa and Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus. These differ from Earth, which is at the right distance from the sun to include liquid water oceans on its surface.\n\nInterior water ocean worlds, or IWOWs, are much further from the sun – but they could still support life within their oceans.\n\n“Because the surface of Mimas is heavily cratered, we thought it was just a frozen block of ice,” said Rhoden, who is also the co-leader of NASA’s Network for Ocean Worlds Research Coordination Network.\n\n“IWOWs, such as Enceladus and Europa, tend to be fractured and show other signs of geologic activity. Turns out, Mimas’ surface was tricking us, and our new understanding has greatly expanded the definition of a potentially habitable world in our solar system and beyond.”\n\nMimas is tidally locked in its orbit around Saturn, meaning that the same side of the moon always faces the planet – like our moon as it orbits Earth. The researchers believe a phenomenon called tidal heating allows for the subsurface ocean to exist on Mimas.\n\nSaturn's small moon Mimas (left) likely has something in common with its larger neighbor Enceladus (right): an internal ocean beneath a thick icy surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute\n\nTidal heating causes an internal increase of temperature in a moon due to its gravitational relationship with a planet.\n\nTo re-create the oscillation detected in Mimas’ rotation by Cassini, the researchers used models to show that tidal heating occurring in the small moon is enough to maintain an ocean beneath an ice shell that is between 14 to 20 miles (22.5 to 32 kilometers) thick.\n\nThis finding could be useful as future spacecraft study ocean worlds in our solar system, but it also shows that Mimas and Saturn’s other moons may be worth observing more moving forward. Future spacecraft could confirm that Mimas is indeed one of these interior water ocean worlds.\n\n“Evaluating Mimas’ status as an ocean moon would benchmark models of its formation and evolution,” Rhoden said.\n\n“This would help us better understand Saturn’s rings and mid-sized moons as well as the prevalence of potentially habitable ocean moons, particularly at Uranus. Mimas is a compelling target for continued investigation.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/13/saturns-rings-were-likely-sculpted-its-moons-nasa-study-said/1446408001/", "title": "Saturn's rings were likely sculpted by its moons, NASA study said", "text": "June 13, 2019 Updated June 14, 2019, 10:03 a.m. ET\n\nThey're the solar system's most iconic feature, but how and when Saturn's rings formed have remained a mystery for centuries.\n\nNow, a piece of the puzzle has been revealed: Astronomers believe the gravitational pull of Saturn's tiniest moons likely shaped and \"sculpted\" the rings, according to the new research, which details how the sculpting took place.\n\nThe rings themselves are made of small particles of ice and rocks, and, according to NASA, are believed to be pieces of comets, asteroids or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet. It's exactly how they turned into rings that remains the mystery.\n\nThe new findings are based on data and hundreds of thousands of photos sent back from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft as it orbited the planet in 2017, shortly before it burned up in Saturn's atmosphere. Now, nearly two years after the end of the mission, researchers are still publishing new studies trying to better understand the features based on the data the spacecraft gathered, according to Space.com.\n\n\"Getting closer to the rings, getting higher resolution images..., we're starting to get new views, some of the best-ever views of some of the dynamics and evolution of what's going on in Saturn's rings,\" NASA's Linda Spilker told Space.com.\n\nTextures and patterns, from clumpy to strawlike, pop out of the images, NASA said, and new images also reveal how colors, chemistry and temperatures change across the rings.\n\n\"These new details of how the moons are sculpting the rings in various ways provide a window into solar system formation, where you also have disks evolving under the influence of masses embedded within them,\" said study lead author and Cassini scientist Matt Tiscareno of the SETI Institute.\n\nThe rings also formed much later than did the planet. In fact, the rings are \"relatively recent,\" scientists said, likely forming less than 100 million years ago and perhaps only 10 million years ago.\n\nSaturn itself is some 4.5 billion years old, the same age as all the other planets in our solar system. This means that for most of its existence, Saturn was probably without its stunning rings.\n\n\"The results strongly suggest that Saturn’s rings are much younger than Saturn itself and provide important clues to the origin of the rings and moons,\" said Shigeru Ida of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, in a review that accompanied the new study.\n\nAs for why Saturn has rings, \"there is no clear reason why Saturn should be special in this way,\" Tiscareno said in an e-mail to USA TODAY. \"One possible answer is that Saturn in fact is not special, but is simply the lucky planet that has rings at the time when we happen to live.\"\n\nThe final answer to how Saturn's rings formed – which has fascinated astronomers for hundreds of years – is still to come, however: “A clear answer to the long-standing question of when and how Saturn’s rings formed has not yet been obtained, but the Cassini data provide important pieces of the puzzle,” Ida said.\n\nThe new study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/03/celestial-events-april-2025-pink-moon-micromoon-lyrid-meteor-shower-planets-easter/82778974007/", "title": "Astronomy April 2025: Pink moon, lyrid meteor shower, planets", "text": "April 3, 2025, 9:48 a.m. ET\n\nApril's full moon, a micromoon, will be on April 12.\n\nThe Lyrid meteor shower is expected to peak April 21-22\n\nA crescent moon combines with Venus and Saturn for a \"smiley face\" in the sky on April 25.\n\nThere are a few things to choose from this month if you enjoy heading out and looking up at the night sky.\n\nThere's a micromoon, \"a smiley face\" and one of the oldest known meteor showers.\n\nHere's what to look forward to in April 2025.\n\nWhen is the April full moon?\n\nApril's full moon will be on April 12 EDT.

The temporary phenomenon is called a ring-plane crossing, during which the rings appear edge-on, or flat and thin, to observers on Earth.\n\nBut later – hundreds of millions of years in the future – a permanent, virtually ringless Saturn will become real, thanks to another process called ring rain in which gravity pulls the rings apart and vaporizes their icy chunks in the upper atmosphere, NASA researchers say.\n\nWhat happens in ring-plane crossing?\n\nRing-plane crossings take place every 13 to 15 years, NASA says.\n\nThe ring-plane crossing in March won't be perfect, since the rings won’t appear precisely flat to us. They’ll be on a bit of an angle.\n\nAnd Saturn will be in conjunction with the sun, or too close to it, making it difficult to view. The rings will gradually reappear in the months after March until they \"disappear\" again in November.\n\nThe ring-plane crossing is a combination of the orbital position and axial tilt of Saturn.\n\nSaturn completes an orbit around the sun every 29.5 years. During that solar orbit, \"the angle of the Saturn's rings relative to the sun varies by 26.7 degrees,\" NASA says. During that variation, the planet's rings are edge-on to the sun at least twice in every orbit.\n\nSaturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system. With an equatorial diameter of nearly 75,000 miles, it's about nine times the size of Earth.\n\nHowever, Saturn's seven rings are about 170,000 miles in diameter, much larger than the planet itself. Despite their massive span, the rings are relatively thin. The three main rings can range from 30 feet to 300 feet thick in most places, NASA says.\n\nThat's why the rings almost vanish when we view them during a ring-plane crossing. However, “Earthbound viewers won’t get a “ringless” view of Saturn until the triple-passing of 2038-2039,” NASA says.\n\nWhat is Saturn's ring rain?\n\nSaturn's rings are composed of mostly water ice varying in size from sand-like grains to large-sized chunks, according to space.com. Rocks and meteoroids are also part of the rings.\n\nIn Saturn's ring rain, gravity is slowly dragging the water ice from the inner rings into the planet’s upper atmosphere, where they vaporize. The inner rings will fall first and the outer rings will follow.\n\nRing rain “drains an amount of water products that could fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool from Saturn’s rings in half an hour,\" according to NASA estimates.\n\nSaturn is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old. The planet's rings, discovered by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610, are believed to be about 400 million years old.\n\nSaturn's neighboring planets, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, all have rings, says the University of California, Riverside. Jupiter's large moons have prevented rings like Saturn's from forming, UCR says, while Uranus and Neptune's rings are \"so flimsy they’re difficult to view with traditional stargazing instruments.\"\n\nCONTRIBUTING Eric Lagatta\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Reuters; space.com; earth.com; astronomy.com; sciencenews.org", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/02"}]}

The first body, discovered on May 1, was likely a murder victim who died from a gunshot wound “some time in the mid ’70s to early ‘80s, based on clothing and footwear the victim was found with,” according to a new release from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.\n\n“The lake has drained dramatically over the last 15 years,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Homicide Lieutenant Ray Spencer said at the time, noting “it’s likely that we will find additional bodies that have been dumped in Lake Mead” as the water level drops more.\n\nAround 40 million people in the West rely on water from the Colorado River and its two largest reservoirs — Lake Mead and Lake Powell — where levels have fallen at an alarming rate over the past few years, amid a climate change-fueled megadrought.\n\nAs of Monday, Lake Mead’s water level was around 1,052 feet above sea level — roughly 162 feet below its 2000 level, when it was last considered full.

Australian Marine Conservation Society/Climate Council/Grumpy Turtle\n\nCoral bleaching events tend to happen when water temperatures are much warmer than normal. But this bleaching event comes despite La Niña, which is characterized by cooler-than-normal temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt’s the fourth mass bleaching in six years and the first since 2020, when about one quarter of the reef surveyed showed signs of severe bleaching. That event came just three years after back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. Previous bleaching occurred in 1998 and 2002.\n\nDavid Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the GBRMPA, said the coral was stressed but not dead.\n\n“If the water temperature decreases, bleached corals can recover from this stress. It is important to remember that we had a mass bleaching event in 2020, but there was very low coral mortality,” Wachenfeld said.\n\nNatural wonder under threat\n\nAustralia’s Great Barrier Reef stretches 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) down the Queensland coast. Before the pandemic forced borders to close, it attracted around three million tourists each year.\n\nThis year aerial surveys with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft showed the worst of the bleaching is near Townsville. Tourist areas near Cairns and Port Douglas have been less affected due to lower levels of heat stress.\n\nBleaching occurs when stressed coral ejects algae from within its tissue, depriving it of a food source. If conditions don’t improve, coral can starve and die, turning white as its carbonate skeleton is exposed.\n\n“Even the most robust corals require nearly a decade to recover,” said Jodie Rummer, associate professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville.\n\n“So we’re really losing that window of recovery. We’re getting back-to-back bleaching events, back-to-back heat waves. And, and the corals just aren’t adapting to these new conditions,” she said.\n\nUnderwater images taken in 2022 show the Great Barrier Reef is suffering heat stress. Australian Marine Conservation Society/Climate Council/Grumpy Turtle\n\nThe Australian government has been under pressure from UNESCO to prove that it’s doing enough to save the reef.\n\nEarlier this year, the Australian government pledged one billion Australian dollars ($700 million) spread over 10 years to support new climate adaptation technology, investment in water quality programs, and protection for key reef species.\n\nWhile the extra funding was welcomed, the government has been called out by global climate experts, among others, for not doing enough to transition Australia away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe Climate Action Tracker gives the country a “highly insufficient rating” for its action on climate change. “The government appears intent on replacing fossil fuels with fossil fuels,” it says, citing the government’s “gas-led recovery” program, announced in 2020 to lead the country out an economic downturn related to the spread of Covid-19.\n\nOn Monday, United Nations Chief Antonio Guterres name-checked Australia among a “handful of holdouts” in the group of G20 countries who had not announced “meaningful emissions reductions.”\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has just completed aerial surveys of all 3,000 reefs on the reef system.

To the wider world, it is known as the dugong.\n\n“Dugongs are sea cows. They’re closely related to manatees and their closest land relatives are elephants,” says Christopher Marshall, an associate professor of marine biology at Texas A&M University. “They’re unique among marine mammals in that they’re vegetarians — they only eat seagrass and other aquatic plants.”\n\nMarshall admits that the connection to mermaids may seem like a stretch, although “that’s also what their scientific name refers to — they’re in an order called “Sirenia,” and siren is another word for mermaid. There’s lots of interesting cultural mythology around them.”\n\nNot all of it is benign, though. Their tears are sold in bottles as love potions or aphrodisiacs, and several of their body parts — including bones, tusks, and penises — are harvested for purported medicinal properties. Their teeth are used to make cigarette holders. They’ve also been hunted for meat and oil for thousands of years, which, combined with habitat loss, has greatly reduced their numbers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) designated the dugong a vulnerable species in 1982, but says the degree to which dugong numbers have dwindled is unknown.\n\nDugongs can live longer than 70 years, reach a length of seven to 11 feet and weigh between 500 and 925 pounds. Mark Kolbe/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nExtinction-prone\n\nDugong habitats are found along the coastal areas of the Indian and Pacific oceans, spanning more than 40 countries. However, they were declared functionally extinct in China last summer, and populations are rapidly declining in countries such as Kenya, Japan and Indonesia, according to the UN Conservation Programme.\n\n“There are two main vulnerabilities for these animals,” explains Marshall. “One is habitat loss: The seagrasses are disappearing all over the world. And two, bycatch: That’s a huge issue for dugongs in the Persian Gulf.”\n\nThe Gulf hosts the world’s second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia. About 3,000 individuals live along the coast of Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, where a conservation program is currently restoring coastal ecosystems.\n\n“We’ve been studying dugongs for the past 20 years,” says Maitha Mohamed Al Hameli, a marine biologist at Abu Dhabi’s Environment Agency. “We began by monitoring them to understand their distribution, and based on that data we have managed to highlight some marine areas that were later declared protected — that’s exactly where we have the highest density of dugong population.”\n\nThe emirate has already restored 7,500 hectares of mangroves, seagrass meadows and coral reefs in a project that targets both land and sea, and is targeting a further 4,500 hectares by 2030. It has also implemented a ban on fishing gear known to trap dugongs as bycatch.\n\n“The restoration project is huge. In addition to the protected areas, we have laws and regulations that protect the critical habitats that support these animals. Our population has been steady for the past 20 years and based on aerial surveys that we do bi-annually, it is actually increasing,” says Al Hameli.\n\nDugongs feed almost exclusively on seagrass such as this one, commonly known as dugong grass or spoon grass. EAD\n\n“A sense of security”\n\nThe program is expected to have positive cascade effects on other creatures, including dolphins, turtles and hundreds of species of fish. “The restoration of mangroves, seagrass and corals has a huge impact on fisheries as well. A lot of the mangroves and seagrass beds act as nurseries for fish in the beginning of their life, especially commercially significant fish,” says Al Hameli, who adds that an increase in mangrove and seagrass patches will also increase the amount of carbon they can sequester from the atmosphere.\n\nThe prospect for dugongs is not only a guaranteed food source — they must eat 10% of their body weight each day, according to Marshall — but also more space where they can safely breed and nurse. “Dugongs will not mate if they don’t feel that the population is secure and safe,” says Al Hameli. “They’re very skittish. They have a strong flight reflex. If they’re being approached they will swim away or dive … So a sense of security and an abundance of food are key drivers for them to breed.”\n\nAbout 3,000 dugongs live in Abu Dhabi's coastal areas. SIRACHAI ARUNRUGSTICHAI/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBecause dugongs are shy, hardly any eco-tourism can be built around them, making it harder to raise awareness for conservation efforts, Marshall says. “Unfortunately, we tend to only conserve what we can really see and things that are charismatic or really cute. The group in Abu Dhabi, they’re way ahead of anybody else in the area and I fully support what they’re doing with the habitat restoration,” he says.\n\n“They’re being smart about it, because there’s a relationship between mangroves and seagrass and coral reefs, so you really need to be restoring all three in order to keep seagrasses around, which is what the dugongs rely on,” he adds.\n\n“It’s a really long, uphill battle, but it’s something that really needs to be done.”", "authors": ["Jacopo Prisco"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/12/seaworld-aims-to-save-floridas-reefs-by-storing-corals-best-genes/70302245007/", "title": "SeaWorld aims to save Florida's reefs by storing corals' best genes", "text": "Updated June 12, 2023, 12:07 p.m. ET\n\nThink of it as a seed bank to store the genes of Florida's most imperiled corals until safer times along the state's dying reefs.\n\nSeaWorld Orlando's new Coral Rescue Center, unveiled Friday, aims to preserve Florida corals that are collapsing under a mysterious disease, which in less than a decade has decimated coral from Martin County to the Lower Keys.\n\nNo one knows for sure what causes the disease, just that it's a stone-cold killer.\n\n\"The Florida Reef Tract is currently under siege by a very lethal disease called Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease,\" Jim Kinsler, zoological curator at SeaWorld Orlando and manager of the Florida Coral Rescue Center, told FLORIDA TODAY Thursday during a behind-the scenes tour of the new facility. \"The disease, once a coral colony contracts it, is almost 100% fatal to that colony.\"\n\nCorals are diverse, living marine invertebrates that lack a spine but their external skeletons build reefs that provide the ecological scaffolding for more species than any other marine habitat, rivaling rainforests in diversity of life.\n\nCountless marine creatures rely on coral reefs to hide, feed and breed. Beyond coral's obvious role in the seafood chain, scientists suspect compounds in sponges and other organisms that grow on coral reefs could yield cures for cancer and other human diseases.\n\nBut many reefs worldwide have already been severely damaged by a growing litany of threats, including pollution, overfishing, global warming and more recently — Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease.\n\nThe disease is not thought to have spread as far north as Brevard County yet and the threat here remains uncertain. Biologists hope the Oculina deep-sea coral species that grows offshore of the Space Coast continues to show some resistance to the disease.\n\nBut at least two dozen other coral species in Florida are either highly, intermediately or presumed susceptible to the disease. That's why, conservation biologists say, SeaWorld's new space to store the most resilient coral genetics is so vital for long-term survival of a key bedrock of the marine and human food web. They hope the coral offspring spawned at SeaWorld can fend off current and future diseases when transplanted back in the wild and teach us why our future is intimately linked to these lowly, stunningly colorful creatures.\n\n“By raising awareness about the importance of corals and their role in the environment, we hope to ignite apassion for conservation in our visitors, empowering them to become ambassadors for the protection and preservation of Florida’s corals,” Kinsler said in a statement before Friday's event.\n\nDignitaries at Friday's grand opening included members from Florida's conservation and rescue communities and local and, state and federal lawmakers. The opening of SeaWorld's new coral center marks a milestone in the Florida and SeaWorld's commitment save the state's reefs, conservation biologists say. SeaWorld calls the center a \"vital hub\" for coral preservation and education, building on the success of the Florida Coral Rescue Center, adding another holding facility for vulnerable corals.\n\nThe 3,750-gallon facility at SeaWorld houses 350 coral colonies and 18 species of at-risk coral, several listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\n\nVisitors can interact with coral biologists working with the “at risk\" Florida reefs.\n\nThreatened corals were selected and transferred to SeaWorld from the Florida Coral Rescue Center (FCRC) –— the largest coral nursery in the country, a 2,000-square-foot facility in an Orlando industrial park off South Orange Blossom Trail. The goal is to save the most disease-resistant coral genes. SeaWorld's new center adds more space beyond FCRC's for rescuers to try to keep pace, or hopefully outpace, Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease lightning-fast scourge through Florida's offshore reefs. The goal is to return the stronger coral to Florida reefs as part of state and national restoration efforts.\n\nSeaWorld's new coral center has advanced aquarium lighting, filtration systems, a working laboratory, and rows of water tanks where the rescued coral live. It is located adjacent to SeaWorld's Manatee and Turtle Rescue habitat. The coral comes from more than rescue sites from Palm Beach throughout the Keys.\n\nExperienced coral biologists at SeaWorld meticulously monitor water chemistry, flow, filtration and lighting to ensure the corals thrive. They hope to preserve a natural environment by introducing \"reef cleaners\" such as fish, snails, crabs and sea urchins. These \"grazers\" play a crucial role in cleaning algae from the corals and their surroundings, enabling coral growth. To supplement their nutrient requirements, the SeaWorld biologists provide the corals with supplemental nutrients that they process for energy.\n\nNew federal money for Florida corals\n\nSeaWorld worked with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee, to pass the Resorting Resilient Reefs Act. The bill continues to support the efforts and expand research and resiliency programs.\n\nThe bill increases authorizations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Program from $16 million to $45 million annually. It also authorizes a state block grant program for $12 million yearly for state efforts to manage and restore coral reefs, and $4.5 million annually for Pacific and Atlantic coral reef cooperative institutes.\n\n“The Florida coral reef is in trouble which poses both an ecological and economic threat to the state of Florida and the country. It’s the largest coral reef ecosystem in the continental United States and vital to maintaining healthy oceans. It also supports over 71,000 jobs and generates over $6.3 billion in tourism revenue every year,” Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee, said in a statement before Friday's event.\n\nThe nonprofit Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida also is the partner of the state's coral rescue center initiative.\n\n“Corals are the rainforests of the ocean,” Andrew Walker, Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida President & CEO, said before Friday's event. “In addition to providing a home for a quarter of all marine life, corals buffer our coastline from damaging storms and fuel our state’s economy. We’re grateful to SeaWorld for providing a space for these rescued corals to thrive and for the public to learn more about our partnership to restore Florida’s Coral Reef.”\n\nThe Florida Coral Rescue Center (FCRC) was established for gene banking and care of corals rescued from the Florida Reef Tract in areas not yet affected by Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease, with the first rescued corals arriving there in March 2020.\n\nWhat is Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease?\n\nBiologists say Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease is unprecedented and has been killing more than 20 Caribbean coral species and coral on Florida’s reefs since 2014. A study last year by NOAA and University of Miami of the 350-mile long Florida Reef tract, from the Dry Tortugas to St. Lucie County, found 70% of the reef is eroding faster than it's growing.\n\nThe disease began near Miami, Florida, and has since spread through the northern extent of Florida's reef tract in Martin County, south through the Florida Keys, west into the Marquesas, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nThe precise cause is unknown.\n\nSeaWorld small demonstration project will enable the amusement park to bring the story of Florida’s dynamic reefs to millions of visitors annually, park officials say, educating and informing them about Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease and other threats to Florida coral.\n\n\"The goal of the facility is not only to preserve these corals, to preserve their genetics,\" Kinsler said. \"but also to to be able to reproduce these corals and return their offspring back to the Florida Reef Tract, so we can continue to preserve these species and these genotypes.\"\n\nFor information, visit SeaWorldOrlando.com.\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection maintains a coral rescue dashboard.\n\nJim Waymer is an environment reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

Daily Times\n\nMarch 17, 2016, 5:37 p.m. ET\n\nNearly 100 miles from the bustling beaches along the Eastern Shore lies uncharted U.S. territory that is teeming with life and largely unexplored. Until now.\n\nScientists have spent the past five years attempting to understand the deep sea Baltimore and Norfolk canyons — so named for the larger Western Shore cities with which they share latitudinal lines. Now, the team is getting ready to release its final findings and maps next month, opening our eyes to a world and its inhabitants previously unknown.\n\nMore than 70 scientists from 20 different agencies and four countries collaborated on the estimated $10 million project to create undersea maps and develop an understanding of the habitats that exist within the mysterious canyons. The study included four expeditions over three years, mapping 6,406 square kilometers with instruments that spent more than 400 hours on the ocean floor.\n\nWhat they found could — and will — fill a 1,000-plus-page book that researchers believed helped prevent oil, gas and other companies from being able to lease land near the bio-diverse habitats for the purposes of energy exploration during the next five years.\n\nProposals to begin energy exploration off the eastern U.S. coastline were in the works for several years, and studies like this are required before any sales can take place. President Barack Obama announced Tuesday he will veto any plans to drill in the Mid-Atlantic region, largely due to environmental concerns raised in this and other studies.\n\n“Humans are moving deeper and deeper into the ocean as we exploit — or over-exploit — natural resources that people need,” said Florida State University professor Sandra Brooke, one of the two lead researchers on the project. “If we don’t understand what’s there, how it’s distributed, how the ecology works, then we run the risk of destroying ecosystems that we don’t understand.\n\n“We could be damaging something that could ultimately help us. We’d basically be shooting ourselves in the foot.”\n\nThe study outlining the canyon areas served as a preliminary guide for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and its partnering agencies, which released a large-scale draft proposal targeting areas that could be leased to energy companies in January 2015, said Marjorie Weisskohl, public affairs specialist for BOEM. Responding to concerns from coastal residents and citing environmental, fishing and recreational conflicts, the region was removed from the table for the 2017-2022 plan, according to a statement from Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell.\n\nThanks in large part to this study, most of the areas surrounding the canyons were already off the table.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina-Wilmington professor Steve Ross, who co-lead the project with Brooke, said their findings in the canyons has helped protect much of the surveyed lands from energy exploration. The team took thousands of samples and photographs and was able to finally go beyond speculation and show the diverse species that live below where the light can reach.\n\n“This study has a huge impact on how we use and manage off-shore resources,” Ross said. “A picture is worth a thousand words. We’ve put into view the unique habitats that nobody has seen before.”\n\nBrooke believes adding the visual elements may help energy explorers and conservationists better understand the fragile ecosystems that could be damaged by drilling.\n\n“People won’t go out of their way to protect what they don’t know about or can’t see, so this outreach will be important to let people know what’s out there,” she said. “It’s not just a grainy picture anymore; it’s beautiful high-definition pictures that we can show in real time.”\n\nMapping the area for energy exploration was not the only goal of the expeditions. Brooke and Ross noted several key findings that could be particularly relevant to the Eastern Shore.\n\nScientists were shocked to learn the two canyons — which exist in similar regions and are roughly the same size and shape — are distinctly different from one another. Each canyon acts as its own planet, housing unique coral formations and sea life that can only exist in those areas.\n\nIn the sometimes over-fished waters off the coast of the Eastern Shore, the canyons often act as habitats for species in need of shelter to replenish their numbers and gain strength.\n\nRoss said one of the canyons contained a large population of cusk — a heavily fished species that was nearly added to endangered lists. The canyon reefs allow the fish to repopulate without abundant threats from predators and fishermen.\n\n“This study was not so much about the canyons themselves but what kind of habitats they provide,” Ross said. “The deep sea is very poorly studied, and what we’re finding is these deeper areas are highly productive, and those communities support a huge ecosystem that is underappreciated.\n\n“The canyons are different, and this indicates we have a long way to go.”\n\nResearchers also discovered methane emissions bubbling from sediment on the ocean floor, known as cold seeps, which certain species that don’t rely on the sun’s light need to survive.\n\nThe discovery of these seeps — previously only known to exist in the Atlantic farther north and south of the canyons — could aid protection efforts, as well. Energy companies are forbidden from drilling within close proximity of the seeps for fear of harming species that are only able to exist there, Weisskohl said.\n\nWhile their findings may seem like bad news for energy companies, Brooke insists knowing what ecosystems are in place will help those agencies more easily avoid damaging sensitive areas that could harm both the environment and their reputations.\n\n“If you want to take a cynical perspective, it actually behooves the energy industry to know where these sensitive ecosystems are and prevent that damage rather than dealing with bad public relations and having to repair them,” she said. “These companies have been doing this for a long time, and they are mandated to do these kinds of studies to understand how these ecosystems may conflict with their energy activities.”\n\nAlthough the final project won’t come out until the end of September, the research findings have already attracted attention, winning the team the coveted Excellence in Partnering Award from the National Oceanographic Partnership Program last month. The multi-agency collaboration included BOEM, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey, along with 12 universities and research institutions and two private companies.\n\nRoss said the recognition underscores the importance of the work they were able to accomplish only by acting as partners.\n\n“Instead of funding one project on fish or corals, we were able to get a lot more bang for the buck when we put together multiple disciplines,” he said.\n\nOf all the findings from the research, Brooke said the true satisfaction comes from creating awareness of the canyon ecosystems in hopes of getting others on board to protect the ocean’s vast resources.\n\n“Even though most people may never see them up close, it’s nice to know that the wilderness is there beyond our concrete jungle,” Brooke said. “It’s been there millions of years, and I don’t think we have the right to just come in and destroy it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/world/patagonia-burrowing-parrots-scn", "title": "Largest parrot colony lives in Patagonia's steep cliffs - CNN", "text": "The new docuseries “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” explores one of the wildest places on Earth. The series airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nCNN —\n\nAt the northern tip of Patagonia’s desert coast in Argentina, the skies above El Cóndor are filled with shifting clouds of chatty, colorful parrots.\n\nThe mountain’s crumbling sandstone cliffs are home to the largest parrot colony in the world, containing 37,000 nests.\n\nThe burrowing parrots are so named because they tunnel into the sandy cliffsides to build their nests. These tunnels can be up to 9.8 feet (about 3 meters) deep.\n\nWith green feathers and white rings around their eyes, burrowing parrots stand out in this barren landscape overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. When the birds fly, bright blue and red feathers flash in the sky.\n\nEl Cóndor’s cliffs serve as a nesting ground for a species that once appeared all over South America, but the burrowing parrot population is now declining.\n\nThe parrots’ food source in the Argentine Monte is disappearing more quickly than the Amazon rainforest. This vulnerable region of desert grasslands and shrubs, which the parrots prefer, has suffered from deforestation.\n\nThe burrowing parrots have to fly three hours away from their nests just to find seeds and berries to bring back to their chicks within the cliff nests. Each year, the birds must travel farther to find something to eat, and it’s estimated the adults fly up to 164 miles (264 kilometers) per day, according to scientists at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany.\n\nMoreover, threats from humans and growing tourism in the area are making life harder for the parrots.\n\nA sky full of birds\n\nArgentine director Kevin Zaouali, who made the first episode of the “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” series that premieres Sunday on CNN, first saw the birds 10 years ago when he visited El Cóndor, entranced by “an entire sky covered by parrots.” Returning to the beach, he and his team had to remain patient, “waiting to see what the animals wanted to offer us.”\n\nThe parrots have distinctive white rings around their eyes and olive green plumage, with splashes of color underneath.\n\nThe film crew spent 20 days with the parrots, wanting to find special moments, Zaouali said. The team listened to the constant chatter of the highly social birds and observed other nuances of their behavior as well. Burrowing parrots are monogamous and mate for life – and they do everything together.\n\nZaouali said he was struck by “the way they look at each other and the way they touch each other. They’re always giving kisses to each other.”\n\nAmid these glimpses of affection were moments fraught with tension.\n\nBurrowing parrots are the prey of the peregrine falcon, the fastest bird on the planet. It can reach speeds of 240 miles per hour (386 kilometers per hour) when diving at its prey. At the site, the falcons moved so quickly that it was nearly impossible to capture their dives on camera.\n\nThe Valdivian temperate rainforest in southern Chile is home to this peculiar predator: the kodkod. Now threatened with extinction, the wild cat is so elusive, some call it the ghost of the forest. Christiaan Muñoz Salas Fjords and mountains in Chile's Corcovado Gulf. Enrique Haag Rodriguez The monito del monte, seen here at Chile's Bosque San Martín Experimental Station, is a tiny marsupial, raising its young in pouches like koalas and kangaroos. It's the only creature in South America to hibernate, and when it enters this state, it breathes once every 3 minutes. Its amazing ability to survive the winter could help scientists better understand the metabolism of humans. Christiaan Muñoz Salas This pod of orcas off the coast of Estancia el Pedral in Argentina targets unsuspecting seals and sea lion pups. The orcas have developed a remarkable technique. They beach themselves, snap up their meal and then expertly maneuver back into the sea. They are one of only two orca families in the world to catch prey in this way. Santiago Sainz-Trápaga/Kevin Zao In Patagonia, marine otters known as chungungo live along the rocky coastline. Until a few decades ago, the chungungo were seen as pests and almost hunted to extinction. Their fur was a valuable prize. However, their numbers are recovering as the local fishing community has a change of heart. Elijah Harris Found only along Chile's Corcovado Gulf, the Chilean dolphin is one of the smallest species in the world. Little is known about these dolphins, but their distinctive round fins and white bellies make them easy to recognize. Mauricio Handler Pumas are protected across Patagonia's national parks, such as Torres del Paine in Chile, but in the past, ranchers have hunted the animals to protect their sheep and cattle from predators.

The insect eats tiny algae that live in the ice and even other ice dragons in hard times. Its habitat is melting away. CNN Original Series The huemul is an incredibly rare South Andean deer. An estimated fewer than 1,500 remain -- just 1% of their former population -- making them one of the rarest mammals on the planet . Conservationists in Chile's Parque Nacional Patagonia follow their movements using radio-tracking collars. Cristobal Santamaria Concha Scientist Verena Häussermann has discovered cold-water corals living in a remote fjord in Chile's Corcovado Gulf. It's one of the only places on Earth where these corals can be found in shallow waters. Unlike tropical corals that need sunlight, these depend solely on plankton for survival. The conditions in these waters are naturally acidic and may help scientists figure out how to protect marine life in other parts of the rapidly changing world. Elijah Harris Two hooded grebes perform a mating dance in Bajo Caracoles, Argentina. The birds come to breed on lakes on a volcanic plateau 5,000 feet above sea level in the Andes. Found nowhere else on Earth, they're one of South America's rare species -- there's only 750 grebes left in the world.

Giant survivors from the Jurassic era more than 145 million years ago, they have outlasted the dinosaurs. Humans -- and parrots -- collect the plant's seeds. Kevin Zaouali Patagonia's most elusive animals Prev Next\n\nSome fledgling chicks inside the nest grow curious as they wait for their parents to return from the feeding ground and fall to the bottom of the mountain if they lean out too far. Zaouali and his crew spent a day watching a chick painstakingly climb centimeter by centimeter back up to the nest after it fell out.\n\nThe sandstone cliffs pose other risks for the colony. The structures occasionally collapse, with massive blocks falling from the cliff face and killing the parrots dwelling inside. But the parrots return each year after spending winters in the north because they prefer the arid openness of the cliffs along the Atlantic coast.\n\nProtecting parrots\n\nThe burrowing parrot is currently considered to be of “least concern,” according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, but the species has been recognized as one that’s declining in population.\n\nDue to their charm and color, burrowing parrots are exploited by the wildlife trade. They have also been hunted as pests who feed on crops. And because burrowing parrots are so picky about where they nest, they are easily disturbed if humans encroach on their space.\n\nBurrowing parrots are incredibly loyal to one another and highly social.\n\nZaouali began filming and photographing animals 16 years ago, and he has already seen changes in the places he once visited as a child. He said he worries that “the land of adventure” could lose the largest parrot colony on Earth and other animals if protective measures aren’t taken for the vulnerable species that call Patagonia home.\n\n“Patagonia is a very special place but also very, very fragile,” Zaouali said. “It’s unique and very wild, and while it seems very distant and pristine, if we don’t try to protect it, it will be like any other place full of pollution.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/jupiter/2023/03/26/celebrities-famous-people-who-lived-in-the-jupiter-area/70048007007/", "title": "Did you know these 38 celebrities lived in the Jupiter area?", "text": "The Palm Beach Post\n\nMarch 26, 2023 Updated Aug. 23, 2023, 10:50 a.m. ET\n\nFrom top-tier athletes, to world-renowned musicians, to TV and movie stars, Palm Beach County has always had its share of famous people who have called it home.\n\nThere's a long list of celebrities who lived in Boca Raton and Delray Beach, like Ariana Grande, Steffi Graf, Marilyn Manson and Adam Sandler.
