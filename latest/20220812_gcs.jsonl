For the past 12 months, the inflation rate has surged upward and is up 7% from last December.\n\nThe increase was up from last month's year-over-over increase of 6.8% and the biggest, fastest increase since June 1982, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released on Wednesday.\n\nMore:Eligible Michigan families to receive at least $95 more in food assistance in January\n\nMore:Iconic Anchor Bar in Detroit temporarily closes\n\nOverall, consumers prices increased 0.5% in December, after rising 0.8% in November.

Beef was down 2% and pork nearly 1% for December. Pork prices increased more than 2% in November.

That trend continued.\n\nIn December, what consumers pay for food at grocery stores rose 6.5% over the last 12 months, the BLS said. The report revealed that increase compares with an average annual increase of 1.5% over the last 10 years.\n\nPrices across all six major grocery store categories also rose in December for the year.\n\nThe meat, poultry, fish, and eggs category had the largest year-over-year increase, rising 12.5%.

But food at home, or the price for groceries, got more expensive and rose 1.4% in February and is up nearly 9% for the year, according to the CPI.\n\nFebruary's rise in groceries was the largest monthly increase since April 2020, according to the report. The cost for groceries in all six categories tracked rose more than 1% in February and are up nearly 8% for the year.

Here are three ways to cut costs.\n\nShop store brands to save\n\nStore brands have grown in popularity in recent years and no longer carry the stigma they once did when they were considered more generic.\n\nTarget added its largest food brand, Good & Gather, in 2019, and has continued to add new products. Trader Joe's and discount grocer Aldi are well-known for carrying more products under their own private labels than store brands.\n\n“You often see lower prices and a lot of great quality there,” Harig said.\n\n►Social Security 2022:Cost-of-living increase will boost benefits 5.9% in 2022, most since 1982 amid COVID-19-related inflation spike\n\n►Grocery prices 2021:Food prices are climbing amid worker shortages, supply-chain problems, extreme weather and more\n\nBuy in bulk, stock up\n\nBuying in bulk at Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale can cut your number of shopping trips down and lower costs.\n\nSometimes, though, it means huge packages of food so buying food in bulk is often best for large families, or for those who have an extra freezer and storage. It also means fewer toilet paper runs\n\nWholesale clubs aren't immune from inflation, though Costco has not increased the price of its rotisserie chicken, which is holding steady at $4.99.\n\nRichard Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer, said Sept. 23 during a call with analysts that despite increases in transportation costs the retailer has “elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months.”\n\nNot everyone will want to join a wholesale club to save money. McGrath suggests stocking up at budget stores like Aldi and by watching sale prices in weekly flyers for buy-one-get-one-free sales.\n\n“Buying things that are on BOGO pricing and freezing them if possible can save you money on next week's grocery run, if not this week’s,” she said.\n\n►Shop at Costco?:These 3 tips will get you the best deals and the biggest discounts\n\n►McDonald's teacher freebie:McDonald's gives teachers free breakfast 'Thank You' meals this week. How to get the freebie.\n\nUse cashback apps like Ibotta, rewards programs\n\nSaving money can come in different forms. Some will clip paper coupons or printable coupons, but another option is to earn cash back on everyday purchases.\n\nOne of the most popular cashback apps is Ibotta, a free shopping app, that makes it easy to save on most grocery store trips, online shopping, gift cards and even booze in some states.\n\nWhat sets Ibotta apart from rewards programs like CVS ExtraCare is that you can use it in person at multiple stores, including Target, Walmart, Costco, Trader Joe’s, Aldi and online at Amazon, Kohl’s, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Macy’s and more.\n\nThe app also offers savings when shopping with on-demand grocery delivery programs like Instacart and Shipt as well as Walmart, Target and Kroger online orders.\n\nIbotta CEO and founder Bryan Leach said there are plans to make earning cash back more seamless with an expanded partnership with Walmart next year.\n\nFetch Rewards is another cashback app, but you can also save using retailer apps like Target's Target Circle loyalty program.\n\n►Saving money is hard:How Ibotta makes it easier to get discounts and earn cash back on groceries, travel and more\n\n►Christmas shipping deadlines 2021:FedEx, UPS and USPS say these are the last days to ship gifts\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko.

That's up from 6.8% annually in November, which was also a nearly four-decade high.\n\nCOVID-19’s fast-spreading omicron variant likely intensified the price increases by spawning more worker absences in global delivery networks and slowing shipments, says Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard.

On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices increased 0.5% in December while core prices advanced 0.6%.\n\nOverall inflation may ease soon\n\nEconomists expect overall inflation to ease in coming months as gasoline and other energy prices continue to pull back and crude oil prices fall. But core inflation is expected to drift higher before edging down as the supply snags are ironed out.\n\n\"Buckle up,\" says economist Leslie Preston of TD Economics. \"After reaching new highs core inflation is likely to get even higher in the first quarter of 2022 on a year-on-year basis.\"\n\nInflation's cost:How much more are you paying and what's the damage for Biden?\n\nGas prices down\n\nLast month, energy prices declined for the first time in six months, dipping 0.4%, with gasoline prices falling 0.5%.

Prices increased 11.8% annually for new cars, 7.4% for household furnishings, 5.8% for apparel and 6.3% for groceries.\n\nChicken and fish prices jumped 10.4% and 8.4%, respectively, over the past year after further monthly advances. Beef was up 13% and pork, 15.1%, despite dips last month.\n\nFood prices up, shelves empty\n\nAdditional food price increases may lie ahead with reports of empty store shelves in the Northeast as a result of omicron-related worker absences and winter storm disruptions, says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.\n\nThe pandemic has been behind the stomach-churning inflation.\n\nConsumers who were already snapping up goods such as TVs and appliances while stuck at home during the health crisis began dining out and traveling more. Many were ready to splurge after they built up more than $2.5 trillion in additional savings from federal stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefit, as well as cutting back during the lockdowns.\n\nSupply snags hit consumer price index\n\nBut a supply network still hobbled by the pandemic wasn’t prepared for the buying binges. Many overseas factories are running at partial capacity. Shipping containers are in short supply. And many truck drivers and warehouse workers are still caring for kids at home or fearful of contracting COVID-19.\n\nThe rare collision of robust demand and skimpy supplies has triggered widespread product shortages and higher prices that are outpacing solid wage increases for low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nFed prepared to hike interest rates\n\nAt his confirmation hearing for a second term Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates more rapidly than planned to contain inflation. The Fed already has accelerated the phaseout of its bond-buying stimulus, a move that would clear the way for interest rate hikes as early as March.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/12/10/food-prices-consumer-price-index/6460634001/", "title": "Americans see the highest food price increase in more than a decade", "text": "Prices that consumers paid for goods and services that included food, shelter, and energy in November rose by a faster rate and at its biggest increase in 39 years.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday released its monthly Consumer Price Index report showing a broad increase of 6.8% over the last 12 months.

So far, they have kept reaching for their wallets . But what happens when they reach their breaking point?\n\nThe pandemic and the supply chain crisis have pushedthe cost of virtually everything higher. Food and cars are more expensive, as are transport and labor costs, making inflation the buzzword of the moment\n\nIn February, consumer prices increased at a level not seen since the start of 1982. And odds are it won't stop there.\n\n\"A month ago, we were generally looking at inflation that was primarily in areas that you were spending more on because of the pandemic,\" such as cars, housing and home renovations, said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist at Manulife Investment Management. \"These were more optional types of inflation.\"\n\nAfter a year of soaring costs, the Ukraine-Russia conflict is pushing prices for more essential categories, like food and energy, up even more.\n\nThe price hikes Americans are likely to experience in the coming months will be much harder to get around, Donald said.\n\n\"We don't see a lot of what economists call elasticity when it comes to demand for fuel and food. We don't have a choice. You can't not eat. You can't not drive to work,\" she said.\n\nGas and food prices on the rise\n\nalready shot up over the past year. Gasoline prices rose 38% in the 12 months ended February, while prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs jumped 13% over the same period, according to The cost of cooking dinner and fueling the car havealready shot up over the past year. Gasoline prices rose 38% in the 12 months ended February, while prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs jumped 13% over the same period, according to Labor Department data\n\nNow gas prices are rising even further and people are struggling to keep up.\n\n\"I try to catch the weekend sales and freeze meat,\" Kathy LeGoux, who lives in Palm Coast, Florida, with her husband, told CNN Business. \"[I] can't buy a lot of fish because it's too expensive now.\"\n\nLeGoux, who is in her 60s, is retired, as is her husband. A high cost of living made them move from Nevada to Florida before the pandemic. But the high prices have followed them, she said.\n\nRetirees and others who live on fixed incomes get hit especially hard when prices go up like they have recently.\n\nLeGoux and her husband have postponed home improvement projects and no longer go on road trips, due to the cost of fuel.\n\n\"And the gas price rolls into food prices,\" she said. \"We're not even talking about inflation any more here. It's more.\"\n\nSoaring food prices are a difficult problem to solve, according to Donald, especially when it's really a problem of global supply. Russia and Ukraine are huge exporters of grain and fertilizer. With trade hamstrung by the conflict, the global food supply chain has already started to feel the pain.\n\n\"The greatest risk facing global supply chains has shifted from the pandemic to the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the geopolitical and economic uncertainties it has created,\" Moody's Analytics economist Tim Uy wrote in a report Thursday.\n\nFor governments and central banks around the world, this is a new challenge for which typical policy changes that were used to fight inflation in the past might not prove as useful. The Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates and combat pandemic inflation, for example, will do little to change the dynamics of the global food supply. That also means it won't help the financial pain many Americans will feel as prices keep going up.\n\nConsumers' breaking point\n\nThere is some good news: American households are better funded than in previous crises, which should help them absorb some of the price increases. During the pandemic, stimulus checks and altered spending patterns helped many households shore up their savings.\n\nBut the more price spikes affect necessary products and services, people will need to reach deeper into their wallets, putting a strain on household finances. This will be particularly hard for lower-income Americans, who don't have excess savings as a result of the pandemic and for whom gas and energy costs generally make up a larger portion of their spending.\n\n\"A 10% increase in oil prices would shave 0.2% from discretionary spending,\" assuming a one-for-one response from consumers, said Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska.\n\nSince the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US oil prices have risen more than 11%.\n\nThat matters because consumer spending is the single most important driver of US economic growth. If people have less money to spend outside of necessities, that could weigh on economic growth this year.\n\nEven though the pandemic recession is firmly in the rearview mirror by now, economists are growing concerned the US could be heading toward a period of stagflation, during which low economic growth and high prices limit consumer spending.\n\nIn short, the inflation situation is a headache for lawmakers and the American people alike.\n\nMeanwhile, questions are arising about the record profits companies have been reeling in during this time of high prices. Last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the matter, showing some lawmakers are clearly concerned about corporate profiteering at the expense of working people who are seeing their hard earned money afford less and less.\n\nSo far surging prices haven't driven customers away from their favorite stores, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future.\n\nCoca-Cola COKE CEO James Quincey said in February that consumers will only accept higher prices for so long . And rising gas prices could push people to their breaking point -- if they're not already there. When household finances become strained, nonessential items and big-name brands with a cheaper alternative are the first to go.\n\n\"It's easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up,\" he said at the time. \"It's much harder when there's a real squeeze on income.\"", "authors": ["Anneken Tappe", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/business/starbucks-prices/index.html", "title": "Starbucks is planning even more price hikes this year | CNN Business", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Starbucks has been hiking prices as inflation soars and labor costs rise.

Over the past 12 months, overall food prices increased 7.9%, the biggest jump since July 1981. Grocery store prices rose at an even faster clip.\n\nEvery food item tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was more expensive last month than it was a year ago. Meat, eggs and soup prices have the widest gap from last year, jumping by double-digits through February.\n\n\"When it comes to saving money on groceries, consumers have many options, but it does require making changes to our routines and some savvy decision making,\" said Carman Allison at NielsenIQ.\n\nHere are some penny-pinching tactics recommended by the pros.\n\nMake a shopping list\n\nGrocery stores are well trained in the science of stimulating your taste buds.\n\nThe best way to avoid impulsive buys that add to your grocery bill? Make a list beforehand of what you're there buy — and stick to it. Don't get distracted by all those desserts and snacks that aren't on your list.\n\nPlanning ahead and shopping with a list help keep you focused on what you need and reduces time browsing around, where temptations can take hold.\n\nBe deliberate at the store and don't add extra stuff to your cart while you wait in the checkout line, where stores tend to put hard-to-resist sweets and other eye-catching items.\n\nShop around\n\nFinding the best deals means shopping around and comparing prices on products at different stores. One might have better prices on eggs, but another might be cheaper for fish.\n\n\"I do not have allegiance to any one supermarket. If you've got the best price, you're my best friend at that moment,\" said Edgar Dworsky, a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts and founder of Consumer World , an education resource.\n\nBut don't just compare prices among the same types of stores. Supermarkets, big box outlets, wholesale clubs, discount grocers and dollar store chains all have different prices and promotion strategies. Check out co-ops and farmers' markets too.\n\n\"People can save a lot of money if they know how these stores are set up,\" said Victor Martino, the founder of grocery consulting firm Third Wave Strategies. He recommends shopping at at least two different store formats.\n\nLook for promotions and deals\n\nStores put out weekly advertisements for sale items in print and online.\n\nFind out when a store releases those offers. Many put out their circular ads on Wednesdays, so that's often the best day to find deals. Check them out and compare.\n\nIf there's a great deal, consider stocking up on the product.\n\n\"When apple juice is 99 cents a gallon, I will buy a case or two,\" Dworsky said.\n\nAnd to make sure you're actually getting a good deal, take a look at the price history of products on websites such as CamelCamelCamel\n\nUse a store loyalty card\n\nMost supermarkets offer free loyalty cards with special deals and savings for members. Some grocers' loyalty cards also offer savings on gas.\n\nUse them.\n\nIf you're not using a loyalty card, \"you're throwing money away,\" Dworsky said. \"It's absolutely crazy.\"\n\nSwitch to store brands\n\nStores' private-label brands used to be considered cheap knockoffs. But grocers have spent a lot of time and money in recent years improving their products.\n\nHouse brands are often produced by the same manufacturers that make the big-name items, but they're typically cheaper. Switching to a private label alternative can save shoppers anywhere from 10% to 40%, according to David Bishop, a partner at grocery consulting firm Brick Meets Click.\n\nExperts consider Costco's Kirkland Signature to be one of the top private-label brands. Other store brands include Great Value from Walmart, Simple Truth from Kroger and Good & Gather from Target.\n\nBeware of 'shrinkflation'\n\nLess cereal in the box. Smaller snack sizes. Ice cream gone missing in a container.\n\nYou're not losing your mind. You are actually paying the same price or more these days for everyday items but running through them more quickly because their sizes have shrunk.\n\nThe reason? A sneaky tactic known as \"shrinkflation,\" deployed by consumer product brands and grocery stores. The phenomenon has been going on for decades, but it typically becomes more common when companies' costs go up, such as during the inflation surge we are seeing today.\n\nThere's a way to beat shrinkflation though, say experts: Compare unit pricing — the price per ounce or per 100-count — on similar products to see which is the better deal.\n\nBuy frozen meat and veggies\n\nMeat has seen some of the sharpest price increases during the pandemic.\n\nIn February, meat prices rose 14% from a year ago. Chicken was right behind, up 13%.\n\n\"Frozen chicken breasts are good quality, can be defrosted one at a time and the savings are significant,\" said David D'Arezzo, a former chief merchant at Dollar General and an executive at pharmacy and supermarket chains.\n\nFrozen vegetables are also a good option, he said. They don't go bad or spoil like fresh vegetables, a hit to your wallet.\n\nAnother tip for buying veggies: Buy them at peak season. If you buy tomatoes or other produce when they're off season, you're likely to pay more.\n\n\"If you shop seasonally, you can save 25% to 30%,\" said Martino of Third Wave Strategies.\n\nLook for ugly produce\n\nLook at the day-old produce racks or produce outlets in your area to save.\n\nThere are also \"ugly\" produce sellers online such as Imperfect Foods and Misfits Market that buy and resell quality fruit and vegetables that grocery stores have rejected at steep discounts.\n\n\"Why not pay half price for slightly-dinged produce?\" Dworsky said.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/energy/us-gas-prices-russia-oil/index.html", "title": "Why are US gas prices soaring when America barely uses Russian ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) There's pain at the pump for American drivers as US gas prices soar to record highs .\n\nAlthough the United States barely uses Russian oil, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is still a big factor in the gas-price spike — among other reasons.\n\nConfused? We'll walk you through it.\n\nSo why is Russian oil affecting the US?\n\nMost of Russia's oil goes to Europe and Asia. But the key here is to think about the oil supply globally, rather than the US specifically. The commodities world is a heavily interconnected one, and oil is priced through a global market. So what happens in one area of the world can affect another.\n\nThe problem at hand is that Russia is one of the world's biggest oil suppliers . In December, for example, Russia sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, including 5 million barrels of the crude oil that's used to make gasoline among other items.\n\nIn 2021, by contrast, Europe got 60% of Russia's oil exports and China got 20%.\n\nBut remember that oil is bought and shipped around the world through a global commodities market. So in that sense it doesn't really matter who specifically is getting crunched by the loss of Russian oil, because lower supply affects those global prices no matter what. And as we know from Econ 101, when there's less supply of an item in demand, prices rise.\n\nFor example, if Europe buys less Russian oil, it will have to replace it with oil from somewhere else — perhaps from the powerful Saudi Arabia-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. That increase in demand for OPEC oil will send its crude prices higher. And guess who else buys hundreds of millions of barrels of OPEC oil?\n\nYou guessed it: the United States.\n\nJUST WATCHED NYC taxi driver: I'm barely surviving with business down and gas prices up Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NYC taxi driver: I'm barely surviving with business down and gas prices up 02:42\n\nWhy is there less Russian supply, anyway?\n\nBut the initial lack of formal bans didn't really matter in terms of prices anyway. There's been a de facto ban on Russian oil since the invasion began, with most of the country's supply sitting unsold\n\nSo investors are essentially pricing oil as if Russia's supply isn't available at all. And again, less supply = higher prices.\n\nWhy can't other countries pump out more?\n\nGood old Covid strikes again. Nobody wanted oil in general in spring 2020, when global stay-at-home orders meant nobody needed to gas up and get to the office. With demand cratering, oil prices did too — even briefly trading at negative prices\n\nIn turn OPEC+ heavily cut production to support prices. And they've kept production targets low since then, only gradually adding back production, even when demand for oil and gasoline bounced back sooner than expected.\n\nGuess who's part of OPEC+? Russia. So yeah, OPEC+ isn't rushing to the rescue. The Saudis have made crystal clear for months, even before the invasion, that the group doesn't plan to open up the oil taps anytime soon.\n\nThat iron resolve may or may not be cracking, however. In one confusing development this week, the United Arab Emirates' ambassador to Washington told CNN that the country wants to increase oil production and will encourage its partners in OPEC+ to do so. But later the UAE's minister of energy and infrastructure tweeted that the nation will to stick to its OPEC+ agreement and gradually raise production.\n\nAnd then, the Iraqi oil ministry said its leaders met and agreed its OPEC+ partners should balance supply and demand to stabilize the market. At this point, who knows.\n\nWhy can't US oil companies ramp up production, then?\n\nAll of the above underscores how oil and gas prices are tied to geopolitical events, the pandemic, drilling logistics and so much more. And it adds up to average US gas prices above $4.33 a gallon as of Friday\n\nIn short, it's all a simple case of supply and demand. But of course it's never really so simple.", "authors": ["Julianne Pepitone", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}]}

There is only a small Secret Service footprint at Mar-a-Lago when Trump is not there.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.\n\nA White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.\n\nInvestigation into documents\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort -- including some that were classified\n\nIn early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump's time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump's attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump's attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\"It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,\" said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront\" that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n\"Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they're interpreting that as a 90 day rule,\" he said.\n\nMembers of GOP back Trump\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats \"continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,\" and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President's defense on social media.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had \"seen enough.\"\n\n\"Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. I've seen enough. The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,\" the Republican leader wrote. \"When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that \"we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.\"\n\nBut the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump's handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to \"fully investigate\" the former President's handling of information.\n\n\"Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America's national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,\" Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said.\n\n\"Although details of today's actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump's potentially grave mishandling of classified information.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Katelyn Polantz", "Sara Murray", "Evan Perez", "Gaborr", "Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/garland-announcement-justice-department/index.html", "title": "Merrick Garland: DOJ filed motion to unseal Mar-a-Lago warrant and ...", "text": "(CNN) In his first public statement since federal agents searched former President Donald Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week, Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday said that the Justice Department had filed in court a request that the search warrant and property receipt from the search be unsealed.\n\nGarland also said he \"personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant in this matter.\"\n\nHe noted that the department did not comment on the search on the day that it occurred. He pointed out that the search was confirmed by Trump that evening. He said that copies of the warrant and the warrant receipt were provided to the Trump lawyers who were on site during the search.\n\n\"The Department filed the motion to make public the warrant and receipt in light of the former president's public confirmation of the search, the surrounding circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter,\" Garland said. \"Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy. Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly without fear or favor. Under my watch, that is precisely what the Justice Department is doing.\"\n\nThe statement comes after days of silence from the Justice Department with regard to the search, as is the department's normal practice for ongoing investigations. Garland stressed that some of the department's work must happen outside of public view.\n\n\"We do that to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to protect the integrity of our investigations,\" he said, while explaining that he would not provide more detail about the basis of the search.\n\nTrump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform Thursday that he would \"not oppose the release of documents,\" adding, \"I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.\"\n\nThe court had instructed the Justice Department to confer with Trump about its request to unseal certain warrant documents from the FBI Mar-a-Lago search and to tell the court by Friday 3 p.m. ET if he opposes their release. CNN reported earlier Thursday that Trump and his legal team had not yet reached a decision on how to respond to the Justice Department's motion, according to a source familiar with their thinking.\n\nTrump's team had contacted outside attorneys about how to proceed, and the former President's orbit was caught off guard by Garland's announcement.\n\nIn a pair of posts to Truth Social following Garland's statement, Trump continued to claim that his attorneys were \"cooperating fully\" and had developed \"very good relationships\" with federal investigators prior to Monday's search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it,\" Trump said. \"Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even 'safecrackers.'\"\n\nJustice Department asks court for documents to be released\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant Monday at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing people familiar with the investigation, reported Thursday night that classified documents related to nuclear weapons were among the items that FBI agents sought when executing the Mar-a-Lago search warrant.\n\nThe people did not offer additional details to the Post about \"what type of information the agents were seeking\" or whether any such documents were recovered, the paper reported.\n\nNewly filed court documents outline what the Justice Department officially moved to do Thursday.\n\n\"On August 8, 2022, the Department of Justice executed a search warrant, issued by this Court upon the requisite finding of probable cause... at the premises located at 1100 S. Ocean Blvd., Palm Beach, Florida 33480, a property of former President Donald J. Trump,\" the motion reads.\n\n\"At the time the warrant was initially executed, the Department provided notice directly to former President Trump's counsel. The Department did not make any public statements about the search, and the search apparently attracted little or no public attention as it was taking place. Later that same day, former President Trump issued a public statement acknowledging the execution of the warrant. In the days since, the search warrant and related materials have been the subject of significant interest and attention from news media organizations and other entities,\" the Justice Department writes.\n\nDOJ then argues for unsealing the search warrant, citing \"the intense public interest presented by a search of a residence of a former President.\"\n\nThe filing confirms that the search warrant was \"signed and approved by the Court on August 5.\" On Thursday, the DOJ filed \"the redacted Property Receipt listing items seized pursuant to the search,\" according to its unsealing motion.\n\n﻿\"Former President Trump, through counsel, was provided copies of each of these documents on August 8, 2022, as part of the execution of the search,\" the filing adds.\n\nEarlier this year, officials from the National Archives arranged the retrieval of 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago. In June, federal investigators served a grand jury subpoena and took away sensitive national security documents.\n\nThen, according to sources, prosecutors developed evidence that there were potentially classified documents with national security implications remaining at the property.\n\nFBI officials under attack\n\nRepublican lawmakers have lashed out at the department, calling the search politically motivated. Several lawmakers on the right have called for increased oversight of the department, and some have even suggested defunding the FBI or that agents planted evidence at the Florida estate.\n\nViolent threats also have exploded online since the search. Posters have written things like \"Garland needs to be assassinated\" and \"kill all feds.\" The biography and contact information of a federal magistrate judge who appears to have signed the search warrant used to execute the search at Mar-a-Lago has been wiped from a Florida court's website after he too became the target of violent threats.\n\nIn a message reviewed by CNN on Thursday moments ahead of the public statement, FBI Director Chris Wray told the bureau's employees their \"safety and security\" was his \"primary concern right now.\"\n\n\"There has been a lot of commentary about the FBI this week questioning our work and motives,\" Wray said. \"Much of it is from critics and pundits on the outside who don't know what we know and don't see what we see. What I know — and what I see — is an organization made up of men and women who are committed to doing their jobs professionally and by the book every day; this week is no exception.\"\n\nIn his public comments, Garland also called out the \"unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.\"\n\n\"I will not stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked. The men and women of the FBI and the Justice Department are dedicated patriotic public servants,\" he said. \"Every day, they protect the American people from violent crime, terrorism and other threats to their safety while safeguarding our civil rights.

Earlier this year, officials from the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, recovered 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump's lawyers previously worked with NARA to voluntarily turn over some documents, but the Mar-a-Lago search clearly indicates a new phase of the probe. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his potential bid to return to the White House.\n\nHere's a timeline of the key moments from the blockbuster investigation.\n\nMay 2021\n\nAn official from NARA contacts Trump's team after realizing that several important documents weren't handed over before Trump left the White House. In hopes of locating the missing items, NARA lawyer Gary Stern reaches out to someone who served in the White House counsel's office under Trump, who was the point of contact for recordkeeping matters. The missing documents include some of Trump's correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as the map of Hurricane Dorian that Trump infamously altered with a sharpie pen.\n\nFall 2021\n\nNARA grows frustrated with the slow pace of document turnover after several months of conversations with the Trump team. Stern reaches out to another Trump attorney to intervene. The archivist asks about several boxes of records that were apparently taken to Mar-a-Lago during Trump's relocation to Florida. NARA still doesn't receive the White House documents they are searching for.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAfter months of discussions with Trump's team, NARA retrieves 15 boxes of Trump White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA says in a statement that some of the records it received at the end of Trump's administration were \"torn up by former President Trump,\" and that White House officials had to tape them back together. Not all the torn-up documents were reconstructed, NARA says. The boxes contained some materials that were part of \"special access programs,\" known as SAP, which is a classification that includes protocols to significantly limit who would have access to the information.\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nNews outlets, including CNN, report that NARA asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump's handling of White House records and whether he violated the Presidential Records Act and other laws related to classified information. The Presidential Records Act requires all records created by a sitting president to be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administration.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nNARA informs the Justice Department that some of the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago included classified material. NARA also tells the department that, despite being warned it was illegal, Trump tore up documents while he was president, and that senior officials in the Trump administration did not properly preserve their social media messages, draft tweets and deleted tweets.\n\nApril and May 2022\n\nOn April 7, NARA publicly acknowledges for the first time that the Justice Department is involved, and news outlets report that prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Trump's mishandling of classified documents. Around this time, FBI agents quietly interview Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago about the handling of presidential records as part of their widening investigation.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nNews outlets report that investigators subpoenaed NARA for access to the classified documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The subpoena, which is part of the process to allow investigators to take possession of the documents from the NARA, is the first public indication of the Justice Department using a grand jury in its investigation.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nFour investigators, including a top Justice Department counterintelligence official, visit Mar-a-Lago seeking more information about classified material that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators meet with Trump's attorneys and look around the basement room where the documents are being stored. Trump briefly stops by the meeting to say hello to the officials, but he does not answer any questions. During the meeting, the federal officials serve a grand jury subpoena for some of the sensitive national security documents on the premises, and they take away the subpoenaed documents.\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\nTrump's attorneys receive a letter from federal investigators, asking them to further secure the room where documents are being stored. In response, Trump aides add a padlock to the room in the basement of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nFederal investigators serve a subpoena to the Trump Organization, demanding surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago. Trump's company complies with the subpoena and turns over the footage. CNN has reported that this was part of an effort to gather information about who had access to areas at the club where government documents were stored. The subpoena was served on June 22, according to The Wall Street Journal\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nThe FBI executes a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago -- a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. The search focused on the area of the club where Trump's offices and personal quarters are located. Federal agents remove boxes of material from the property. The search was the first time in American history that a former president's home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nAfter three days of silence, Attorney General Merrick Garland makes a brief public statement about the investigation. He reveals that he personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant, and pushes back against what he called \"unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department.\" Garland also announces that the Justice Department will ask a judge to unseal some of the search warrant documents, for the sake of transparency.

It remains unclear why those around the former President believed the investigation had stalled, but in June, his attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to preserve the remaining documents in his possession \"until further notice,\" one source told CNN.\n\nThe concern arose after the former President had returned some 15 boxes of materials to the National Archives.\n\nA source familiar with Trump team deliberations said it will push an argument that Trump didn't have any classified information at Mar-a-Lago because he declassified it when he was President.\n\nLegal analysts say the declassification procedure is a bit of a gray area when it comes to the president and producing proof. One former White House lawyer said the White House counsel would typically want to create a memo detailing the declassification for the president to sign, but that is not a requirement.\n\n\"The president has wide latitude to declassify, and there's no strict, formal procedure that must be followed,\" CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said. \"So if Trump claims he declassified documents while in office, that could come down to a factual dispute and would turn on the strength of the evidence either way.\"\n\nAfter leaving office, a former president no longer has the authority to declassify information.\n\nThis, of course, does not address the Presidential Records Act and the requirement that White House documents be preserved with the National Archives.\n\nOn Monday, federal agents removed boxes of material from the Palm Beach property.\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago search, which focused on the area of the club where Trump's offices and personal quarters are located, marked a major escalation of the classified documents investigation.

Answers to your questions\n\nTrump also claimed that agents searched his safe, but did not elaborate. “They even broke into my safe,” he said in his statement.\n\nTrump and many of his associates are also under scrutiny by the FBI, the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other federal and state agencies for alleged wrongdoing during his four-year administration and related to his various business entities.\n\nFederal law enforcement officials had no immediate comment on whether agents were at Mar-a-Lago and if so, for what reason.\n\nSearches and probable cause\n\nUnder the law, any search would need to be authorized by a judge after finding evidence of probable cause that a crime had been committed, “and that there's probable cause to believe that the evidence of the crime exists in the place to be searched,” said David Kelley, the former interim U.S. Attorney and deputy U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan.\n\n“That a judge is making a finding of probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and there's evidence of that in the President's own safe, then that's pretty significant,” Kelley told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat we don't know:FBI searching former president's home is blockbuster news. Now what?\n\nKelley said legal protocol would be to wait for someone to open the safe, even if Trump had to designate a proxy to do so if he was not on the premises during the search.\n\n“He’s saying that they broke into his safe. If they wanted to get into a safe and he wasn't worried about what's in it, why wouldn't he just say, ‘Okay, go ahead and go into my safe,’ ” asked Kelley.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment Monday.\n\nFBI and 'unprecedented' raid\n\nSpeaking on FOX News, Trump's son, Eric, called the search \"more political persecution of Donald J. Trump. They can't stand that Americans love him.\"\n\n\"The idea that the FBI or any other law enforcement agency is raiding a former president’s house is stunning, period, – and unprecedented. Even for Trump,” said Matthew Dallek, a longtime presidential historian who has written extensively on modern-era politics and presidents.\n\n“If the FBI or any other federal agencies are raiding the former president’s home, I would presume it is for a very active criminal investigation, or investigations,” Dallek told USA TODAY. “The FBI raids homes typically for hardened criminals and mobsters. It is an iconic image dating back decades. If a former President’s home is surrounded by FBI or other federal agents, that is certainly an even more iconic image.”\n\nMore on MAL:DOJ plans to investigate handling of White House records sent to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort\n\nThe FBI notified the Secret Service in advance of the law enforcement action, indicating that they had a search warrant for the property, a person familiar with the action said.\n\nThe official who is not authorized to comment publicly said the Secret Service facilitated the FBI's entry to the property but did not participate in the search. The source did not characterize the law enforcement action as a raid, emphasizing that officials were notified in advance of the FBI's arrival.\n\nAs unprecedented as such action on a former president home is, Bradley P. Moss, a national security lawyer, said Trump’s handling of documents justified the search.\n\n“No one, not even Donald Trump, is above the law,” he says. “Properly marked classified documents were taken to Mr. Trump’s personal residence after he left office and were stored in an unsecured manner for months. That is a clear violation of the law.”\n\nLast month, it was disclosed that federal prosecutors had been questioning witnesses about the conduct of the former president as part of an inquiry into an effort to overturn the 2020 election, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe action is part of a more aggressive review of attempts by the former president's allies to intervene in the election by substituting fake electors to tilt the vote in key states and to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of President Joe Biden's election.\n\nThe news in your inbox:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter here\n\nWhile the source said prosecutors have recently questioned witnesses about Trump, the person declined to describe the queries in detail.\n\nDOJ approval of FBI raid\n\nFormer FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told CNN on Monday night that the search warrant issued for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence would have been “planned out and reevaluated and legally examined” at the highest levels of the FBI and Justice Department.\n\n“I can't overemphasize how big of a deal this would have been within the Department of Justice and the FBI,” said McCabe. “This is not, you know, a couple of agents showing up at some judge’s door in the middle of the night to get an emergency warrant.”\n\n“This is something that would have been planned out and reevaluated and legally examined from every possible angle by the entirety of the leadership structure (of) both organizations,\" he said.\n\nCapitol attack:Pressure campaigns, predictable violence: What we learned from all eight Jan. 6 hearings\n\nTrump allies:Georgia election investigation heats up. Giuliani, Eastman facing dates with grand jury\n\nIn explaining the process of obtaining a federal search warrant, McCabe said any prosecutor would have to go before a judge “and convince that judge that there is probable cause to believe both that a federal crime has been committed, and that evidence of that crime is contained within the space you have described in your warrant request.”\n\nMcCabe, who is now a law enforcement analyst for CNN, was fired by Trump in 2018 shortly before he was planning to retire from the FBI. He charged the firing was politically motivated.\n\nThe examination of Trump's actions in the run-up to the Jan. 6 insurrection was first disclosed by The Washington Post, which cited four people familiar with the matter.\n\nGarland on Trump and Jan. 6\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, in a NBC News last month, did not exempt Trump from federal scrutiny in the Jan. 6 investigation, saying that federal prosecutors will pursue \"anyone who was criminally responsible.\"\n\nAttorney General:Garland vows to pursue charges on 'anyone' criminally responsible for Jan. 6 when pressed on Trump\n\n\"We pursue justice without fear or favor,\" Garland told NBC when pressed on whether that could include Trump. \"I'll say again that we will hold accountable anyone who is criminally responsible for attempting to interfere with the... legitimate, lawful transfer of power from one administration to the next.\"\n\n“President Trump did not handle classified documents properly. I witnessed it,” former Trump White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told USA TODAY. “I saw him on, I don’t know, how many occasions ripping up documents, throwing some on the floor, ripping some up and putting them in his pocket, not ripping some of them up and putting them in his pocket.”\n\nGrisham watched Trump mishandle documents while they were on a plane together from Mar-a-Lago to Washington on their way to the Middle East.\n\n“Those could have been classified, or maybe they weren't. I don't know,\" she said. \"But it's still mishandling documents. Anything the president technically handles is considered sensitive.”\n\nLast month, federal investigators searched the home of former assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark, who drafted a letter to officials in six states to overturn their election results. And authorities seized the cellphone of John Eastman, one of Trump's personal lawyers who developed a scheme to have then-Vice President Pence singlehandedly reject electors from states Joe Biden won. Pence refused to carry out such a plan.\n\nPence's former chief of staff, Marc Short, has acknowledged that he had testified before a federal grand jury.\n\nMore:Rudy Giuliani seeking to delay Georgia grand jury appearance, cites heart condition\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy accused the Justice Department of reaching \"an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.\"\n\n\"When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned,\" he tweeted. \"Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar.\"\n\nSeveral former Trump officials appeared on FOX News to denounce the search as partisan and unwarranted.\n\n\"It's unfortunately crossed the Rubicon to some extent where previous administrations are now investigated ... by the next administration,\" Matthew Whitaker, former acting attorney general under Trump, told FOX News. \"It's something (found) in a banana republic.

Three people familiar with the situation have told CNN that the search was made as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there.\n\nThe National Archives had previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records, including records that contained classified material, were recovered from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-search-explainer/index.html", "title": "Here's what's next for Trump after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago ...", "text": "(CNN) The FBI search of former President Donald Trump 's residence in Florida on Monday signaled an extraordinary escalation of an investigation into the handling of certain documents from his presidency and raises questions about whether his legal exposure extends beyond whether he improperly took government records when he left the White House.\n\nWhat exactly the FBI was searching for and why is still unknown. But to obtain a search warrant, investigators would have had to show a judge that there was probable cause of a crime and that evidence of that crime was located at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach resort.\n\nHere's what to know about the legal significance of the search, which comes as Trump is preparing a potential 2024 presidential run, and what could come next:\n\nWhat would it have taken for the DOJ to have obtained the search warrant?\n\nTo get judicial approval for the search, investigators would have had to present to a judge a detailed affidavit that would establish that probable cause exists to believe that a crime had been committed and that that evidence of that crime exists in recent days at the property where the search is being sought.\n\nThe search warrant would have been filed under seal, meaning that its details are not publicly available at the moment (though they could become public in the future). The federal courthouse in West Palm Beach lists only one sealed search warrant application since June that was still not closed as of Friday, according to the court's public register of cases.\n\nBut before prosecutors got to the point of asking a magistrate judge to approve the warrant, in order to move forward with a search that carried such historical and political significance, investigators would have had to obtain the OK from the highest levels of the Justice Department, legal experts told CNN.\n\nFormer DOJ officials told CNN that it was likely that, at the very least, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco would have had to have given the green light and that Attorney General Merrick Garland and/or FBI Director Chris Wray may have also been consulted.\n\n\"Not only would the investigators have to suggest it, not only would a line prosecutor have to agree with it, but multiple layers of management would have had to approved of it -- all the way up to the Attorney General,\" Daren Firestone, a former DOJ attorney, told CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department has declined to comment.\n\nWhat does this mean for Trump's legal exposure?\n\nTo take the extraordinary step of executing a search warrant on a former president's home suggests investigators are looking at more than what the National Archives had previously recovered from Mar-a-Lago, according to legal experts.\n\nIn January, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago, including materials that had been identified as classified, but activity around those boxes have been quiet since the spring.\n\n\"I really don't believe that the department would have taken such a significant step as pursuing a search warrant for the president's residence about information they already had back,\" Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director and CNN contributor, said on CNN \"Newsroom.\" \"There had to be a suspicion, a concern and indeed specific information that led them to believe that there were additional materials that were not turned over.\"\n\nBefore the news of Monday's search, a law known as the Presidential Records Act had been forefront of public speculation about Trump's legal jeopardy as other investigatory steps were taken related to the handling of documents from Trump's White House. That law -- passed after Watergate to make clear that certain records from a presidency belong to the public and not the former office holder -- is not a criminal statute and has been seen as relatively toothless law.\n\nA search warrant and the presence of the FBI signifies a criminal investigation. There are other record retention statutes that bring with them criminal penalties -- such as the Espionage Act -- but at this point it's not clear what criminal statutes have been implicated in the Justice Department investigation.\n\nIt is a crime to destroy or remove federal records, or to mishandle classified documents. There are other federal laws that aim prevent the tampering of information during an investigation.\n\nEarlier this year, the Justice Department issued subpoenas for presidential materials including classified documents that the National Archives had previously retrieved. The FBI also interviewed Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago in the spring as part of the probe, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nFor investigators to escalate their probe with a search, \"there would have to be something serious enough that would merit more than a slap on the wrist,\" Firestone, now a partner at the DC-based firm Levy Firestone Muse, said.\n\nIt's also notable that the DOJ hasn't gone the route of civil litigation against the former president for how he handled the documents in question. Just last week, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against former Trump White House official Peter Navarro, alleging that Navarro had violated the Presidential Records Act and seeking a court order compelling him to turn over emails from a private account that he used while working at the Trump White House.\n\nWhy now?\n\nThe search was executed two months after the previously unreported June 3 meeting between DOJ investigators and Trump's attorneys at the resort. During the visit, reported by CNN on Monday, four investigators, including the chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, toured a basement where boxes of materials were being stored.\n\nFive days later, investigators sent Trump's attorneys a letter asking them to further secure the room storing the documents, prompting aides to add a padlock to the room.\n\nFor the FBI to execute a search warrant two months later hints that the federal officials were not satisfied with what they saw on the visit or that they were not confident in the voluntary cooperation they were receiving from Trump's team, some legal experts said. It's possible federal officials also needed official sign off to repossess classified records.\n\n\"The fact that the FBI learned Trump still had documents at [Mar a Lago] in June, and felt the need to come back two months later with a search warrant, indicates to me that the agency has evidence that Trump and his staff were holding onto additional classified records and not taking any steps to properly return them to the Archives,\" Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer, told CNN in an email.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Genius': Bash on Trump's political positioning after FBI search Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Genius': Bash on Trump's political positioning after FBI search 03:04\n\nIt also may have taken months for the Justice Department to decide to do search and how it should go about it.\n\nWhen the FBI was leaving Mar-a-Lago, Trump's team would have received a document akin to a receipt of what was taken. But DOJ can be as vague as it wants in that documentation.\n\nMore broadly, the Justice Department can keep large swaths of its investigation secret, as the Justice Department made clear in court filings Monday evening around its search of John Eastman, the former Trump lawyer who spearheaded plots to subvert the 2020 election.\n\nIn that filing -- where the Justice Department was arguing against an Eastman request that January 6 investigators return devices seized from him in late June in New Mexico -- prosecutors said there was no obligation for the Department to share with Eastman more details about the status of its probe.\n\n\"The Government has no doubt that the movant would like to have full knowledge of the Government's investigation and the ability to 'engage [federal agents] in a debate over the basis of the warrant,\" the filing said. \"But the law only, and properly, requires a neutral magistrate judge to find probable cause to search for and seize any electronic devices on his person; it does not require that the person searched know the basis for the warrant.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt still not known how off guard Trump's lawyers were with the FBI actions taken Monday and what Trump's team has been arguing to the DOJ about the handling of the documents in previous interactions with investigators.\n\nTrump could take a pre-emptive legal step to challenge in court the way the FBI handled the search, perhaps with the goal of getting thrown out any evidence investigators had obtained or at least to try to get more information about what investigators in probing.\n\nBut without such court activity, the next steps of the investigation could very well continue in secret.\n\nCan Trump be barred from running for president if he is found to have violated records law?\n\nAnother law that may be implicated by the FBI's search is one barring the willful concealment, removal or mutilation of government records. That law threatens as a punishment disqualification \"from holding any office under the United States.\"\n\nHowever, there are questions about the constitutionality of that law and its applicability to a Trump presidential run, if he were to be convicted under it.\n\nBecause the Constitution sets specific qualifications for presidential office -- and lays out a separate impeachment process for disqualifying presidents from holding office in the future -- some argue that Congress would not have the authority to enact such a statute that would apply to a presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/mar-a-lago-search-informant-documents-donald-trump/index.html", "title": "Informant tipped off investigators about more documents at Mar-a ...", "text": "(CNN) The FBI search of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence on Monday was prompted by a tip to investigators about the possibility of additional classified documents at the Palm Beach club, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\n\"someone familiar with the stored papers told investigators there may be still more classified documents at the private club\" beyond what Trump turned over to the National Archives earlier this year.

Jim Banks, at his residence in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to a person familiar with their plans, providing a timely opportunity for the former president to rally members to his side after the FBI search.\n\nA July CNN poll found that a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters do not want Trump to be their party's nominee in the 2024 presidential election. But the former president still is powerful within the party; Republican candidates across the country have sought his endorsement in their 2022 primaries, and on Saturday, Trump overwhelmingly won an unofficial straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas.\n\nRallying around Trump, many Republicans, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, attacked Democrats instead after news of the FBI search, with some saying that Biden himself must be investigated.\n\n\"There must be an immediate investigation and accountability into Joe Biden and his Administration's weaponizing this department against their political opponents -- the likely 2024 Republican candidate for President of the United States,\" said New York Rep.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled read", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}]}

Now, over a month later, Toyota has not yet identified the issue and is offering to simply buy back the SUVs from customers who no longer want to wait for the problem to be resolved.\n\nBecause the issue became evident soon after the SUVs went on sale, there are only about 260 BZ4X owners in the United States facing this situation. There are more who had ordered the SUV but not yet had it delivered when the \"Do not drive\" warning was announced. Those customers have never been able to accept delivery of their SUVs.\n\nThe automaker has offered a number of options beyond the buyback while it asks the owners for their patience. Toyota is also offering customers the free use of another Toyota vehicle until the issue is found and corrected. Toyota is also offering owners $5,000 toward their car payments or as a partial refund of the purchase price. Toyota will also extend the vehicles' factory warranty by the amount of time — whatever it ends up being — that the SUVs have been taken out of service.\n\nFor the customers who simply want to sell their vehicles back, the exact terms of the repurchase may vary depending on various state regulations and specifics of the owner's situation.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/cars/toyota-bz4x-tundra-recall/index.html", "title": "Toyota is recalling its first mainstream electric car because the ...", "text": "(CNN Business) Toyota has issued recalls for its first mainstream electric car and one of its full-sized pickup trucks for problems in which nuts or bolts could loosen and wheels or axles can become disconnected.\n\nToyota warned owners of BZ4X electric SUVs to stop driving them because the wheels might fall off. The SUVs only recently went on sale in the United States and the warning and recall announced by Toyota Motor Sales USA on Thursday applies to all approximately 260 BZ4X SUVs that have been delivered to customers so far.\n\nBZ4X owners should stop driving the vehicles immediately, according to Toyota's announcement.

So do Bolt owners Wendy Fong, Stan Goldberg and Durham Smith. They find it unsettling to own a vehicle even GM has warned could catch on fire.\n\n“It’s unnerving at the very least,\" said Smith of Lake Wylie, South Carolina. He owns a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV. \"How can we possibly put a car in our garage that might catch on fire? I don’t feel secure parking a car outside given our tree coverage.”\n\nLast month, GM expanded its second recall on Bolts to include all model years through 2022 – that means Smith's Bolt too, which he'd bought just 15 days earlier. The recall, which affects about 141,000 vehicles globally, is due to battery defects that could start a fire. There have been a dozen Bolts that have caught fire while parked, although GM has not confirmed that each of those fires was caused by defective batteries.\n\nGM has apologized to its Bolt owners for the inconvenience, saying it and its battery maker, LG Chem, have \"hundreds of people\" working around the clock to find the cause of the problem and correct it to ensure defect-free products will be made going forward.\n\nAs of Friday, GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said the automaker is \"still working with LG on manufacturing process updates.\"\n\nGM has said that when it is confident that LG Chem can produce defect-free battery modules, GM will notify Bolt owners in writing and repairs will begin. Once a repair is made, GM will provide an eight-year/100,000 mile warranty on it. In the meantime, GM has assured Bolt owners that if they follow three steps, the cars should be safe:\n\nKeep the car charged to only 90%.\n\nAvoid depleting the battery below a range of at least 70 miles.\n\nDo not park the car in a garage or charge it overnight.\n\n\"We understand the frustration Bolt EV owners are experiencing and are working as quickly as we can to make sure LG has instituted updated manufacturing processes based on both of our teams working together on the issues,\" Kelly said.\n\n► GM recalls all Chevy Bolts for fire risk:Recall costs the company an extra $1 billion\n\n'Minor problem, minor risk'\n\nSome Bolt owners take the recall in stride.\n\n“There’s over 80,000 Bolts made and just over a dozen fires. There’s hundreds more who have been in (unrelated) accidents,\" said Douglas Shrock of Eureka, California, who owns a 2021 Bolt. \"You’re more likely to get in an accident. That’s my risk assessment. Nothing changed for me.\"\n\nShrock even used an inverter on his Bolt last year to power his house during an electrical outage. Kelly said GM does not encourage that because the Bolt was not designed to do that. Still, Shrock is a fan of the vehicle.\n\n\"The problem is a minor problem. In life, it’s an incredibly minor risk,\" Shrock said. \"So if I don’t get a new battery for three years, that’s an 11-year warranty for me when I do get it. I am very happy with the car.\"\n\nBut for others, the safety steps are only doable for so long and the risk is too great.\n\n“How is that realistic? If it’s your only vehicle how are people getting by?\" said Nathan Gardner, the Bolt owner who lives in Sonora, California. \"There are people like myself in fire-prone areas putting their families and homes at risk because there’s nowhere to charge and you can’t stay up all night to watch it charge. I am not sure why these cars are even on the road?”\n\n► Costco recall:70,000 teak shower benches recalled after 81 reports of breaking, 4 injuries\n\n'Can't sleep at night'\n\nThe public has taken notice of the recall too with some parking garages forbidding Bolts an entrance.\n\nOn the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV Owners Group on Facebook, a Bolt owner posted a photo of a sign on his office parking garage in Seattle, Washington, that read: \"Chevrolet Bolt EVs are strictly prohibited from entering this facility in conjunction with the recent recall due to fire-related safety concerns.\"\n\nThe person who posted the photo expressed frustration that there is no fix yet, noting he had to street park nearly 2 miles away. He spoke to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY network, but asked that his name not be published because he just started the buyback process with GM for his 2021 Bolt and he does not want to derail it.\n\nBut when asked about his reaction to the recall, he said: \"I feel very lied to. I specifically bought the 2021 over a used 2016 because I was told it wasn’t a risk, the problem had been taken care of.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gardner, 46, has owned his 2019 Bolt since October 2018 when he bought it new for $42,000. He has enjoyed it, even after GM issued the first recall last November on 2017-19 model year Bolts for potential fire risk. He said he followed GM's safety protocols then and got GM's repair done on it in May. He was assured by his dealer that it all looked good, he said.\n\nBut in June, Gardner and his family returned home from a camping trip, plugged the vehicle in to charge it in the garage and within a short time smelled intense heat. Gardner, who works as a park ranger and firefighter, said the garage was at least 90 degrees inside.\n\n“I felt along the rims and bottoms of the car,\" Gardner said. \"The inside wasn’t hot, but the lower areas near the battery were really hot. I would chalk that up to a close call.\"\n\nIt was the first time he ever had a problem with the car, but it would be the last, he said. By mid-June, he was pushing GM to buy back his Bolt.\n\n\"If my property caught on fire, we could be the reason that all of Sonora burns off the map,\" said Gardner, who lives near many of the recent wildfires. \"I can’t sleep at night knowing the car outside our home could possibly catch on fire.\"\n\nIn August, GM sent Gardner a letter saying that it would buy back his Bolt, but as of Wednesday, Gardner said GM has not said how much it will give him for the car, though his dealer told him to expect $23,000, “which is insane. This is a car I would have otherwise kept for 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nGardner still wants a buyback even if there is a fix, but he said he'll remain open in the future.\n\n\"If the '22 model was clear I would have switched right over,\" he said. \"However, I'm going to wait and see what happens. I'm not interested in being a guinea pig on fire.\"\n\n► Target car seat trade-in event returns:How to get a 20% discount for recycling an old car seat\n\nNo payment on it\n\nGM's Kelly said GM is buying back vehicles on a case-by-case basis, but he declined to reveal the criteria used to determine whether a person gets a buyback and the buyback amount.\n\nSmith, 74, is determined to get a buyback. He said he refuses to pay on the vehicle, he is considering contacting a lawyer and he might run a full-page ad in his local newspaper telling his story.\n\nOn Aug. 5, Smith and his wife, Cyndie, bought a 2022 Bolt EUV – the all-new compact electric SUV – for about $40,000. The couple wanted to be environmentally conscious, plus it was fun to drive and, \"I loved the car, it was just wonderful,\" Cyndie said.\n\nBut on Aug. 20, their new vehicle was part of GM's recall. Four days later, Smith returned the vehicle to the dealership, hoping to exchange it for a Buick Envision SUV, he said. But the dealership offered them $29,900 for it and the Envision was $39,900, Smith said.\n\nFrustrated, Smith decided rather than park the Bolt on his tree-lined driveway or in his garage, he left the Bolt, with the keys in it, at the dealership and called a taxi to take him home. His first payment for it is approaching and the car remains at the dealership.\n\n\"I am looking at a couple of options, none of which are paying on it because I feel that would be to acquiesce and it'd be an admission of ownership,\" Smith said. \"I see it as unethical on General Motors' part to leave the car on the market.\"\n\nSmith has submitted all required paperwork to the automaker seeking a buyback, he said, and now he waits for a response.\n\nA lifelong GM customer, Smith said if GM and LG figure out a fix, he will still likely want a buyback because \"GM's actions thus far have done nothing to instill confidence in either their capacity to fix the problem nor in any veracity in a statement about having done so.\"\n\n► Vehicle recalls:Car recalls for August 5-12\n\n'Expediently executed' or out\n\nIt's the waiting that has Wendy Fong worried and wanting her money back.\n\nFong bought her 2021 Bolt EUV on July 8, just a month before her vehicle would be part of the recall. She lives in a townhouse in Los Angeles so had there been a fire in her garage, she said, it would have affected her neighbors.\n\nShe likes the vehicle, but she said she hates the uncertainty around the recall.\n\n\"I would like to have a timetable of, ‘This is what’s going to happen as a customer and if you don’t like it, we’ll buy it back or we’ll put you in a different car,' \" Fong said. \"I don’t want to deal with this on a long-term basis, and I don’t want a patch or temporary fix.”\n\nFong said if there is a fix that is reliable, safe and \"expediently executed,\" she would keep the vehicle. She admits \"expediently executed\" is subjective. For her it means a maximum of three months to get the repair done.\n\n\"Living with the existing restrictions per GM or for an indeterminable time would not be acceptable,\" Fong said. \"For our car specifically, the recall status as of Wednesday morning is still, 'Incomplete. Remedy not yet available.'\"\n\n► Munich Motor Show:Electric vehicles dominate show\n\nIn a bind\n\nStan Goldberg, 78, accepts the fact that he will have to be patient.\n\nGM rejected his ask for a buyback of his 2017 Bolt, a vehicle he bought used two years ago, he said. Goldberg, who lives in San Francisco, said GM did not provide a reason for the rejection. So he feels he is in a bind.\n\n\"What are you going to do? You can sell the car, but once the recall is out you’re not supposed to sell the car and then you have the issue of what do you do in its place?\" Goldberg said. \"That’s a problem.\"\n\nGoldberg noted that a global shortage of semiconductor chips has made new-car inventory tight and prices sky-high for both new and used cars.\n\n\"If you want an EV, the deliveries are out until springtime,\" Goldberg said. \"So you don’t have an immediate avenue to solve the problem. You’re stuck with being patient.\"\n\nThat comes with a price. Goldberg has been parking the Bolt on his driveway instead of in his garage due to the recall and a rodent climbed inside and chewed up his charger cord. That cost him $300 to replace.\n\nStill, Goldberg said he is prepared for it to take six months before his Bolt will get new battery modules once there is a fix. But he said he'd like to see GM offer other incentives to owners such as putting them in an internal combustion engine car or offering incentives on the upcoming Cadillac Lyriq all-electric SUV due out later next year. GM declined to comment on GM's specific considerations with customers, saying that happens on a case-by-case basis.\n\n► J.D. Power Initial Quality Study:Names 23 highest quality vehicles of 2021\n\n'Hang tight'\n\nLawyer Shalev Amar, owner of Amar Law Group, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, specializes in lemon laws. He said most states' lemon laws say once there is a fix, a car cannot be in the shop, out of service, for 30 days or longer. In this case, there are other considerations.\n\n\"Maybe there are environmental factors such as they live in Arizona, it’s a desert out here so that might make things more precarious\" to charge the Bolt, Amar said. \"So even with the safety restrictions, the vehicle can’t be driven at all for at least 30 days. In my mind that’s unreasonable. That’s the same as it being in the shop for 30 days under lemon laws.\"\n\nAmar said the restrictions on charge, miles to drive and parking it outside implies, \"the use is so limited, once it gets to 60 days without a fix, that would be unreasonable,\" in his view.\n\n“The other part of the lemon law is substantial impairment in use and value,\" Amar said. \"(Bolt owners) are not getting what they paid for. I don’t know how anyone can argue, with a straight face, that these restrictions are not substantial impairment in use and value.”\n\nHe said GM should provide Bolt owners with loaner vehicles. GM's Kelly said, \"We will work with our dealers, as well as rental car providers, to provide loaner transportation.\"\n\nFor its part, GM has idled production of its new Bolts built at Orion Assembly in Orion Township from Aug. 23 to Sept. 27. So it is eager to find a fix as much as anyone, its spokesman has said. But GM insists it will not restart production or do repairs until it has absolute confidence in LG making defect-free products.\n\n\"Once we’re confident we have the correct processes in place, we will work as quickly and safely as we can to produce the battery modules that will be used as replacements as part of the recall,\" Kelly said. \"This will require some ramp-up time but, again, we will work as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAmar said this is one of the more unusual recalls he's ever seen.\n\n\"They’ve done the recall, but they’re delaying doing the repair until they have a proper fix — I’ve never heard of that — it’s very unique,\" Amar said. \"Usually they do a recall and they have a fix or fix plan and are ordering parts and will do it. It’s, 'This is a major recall and we have an issue, but hang tight.’ Life doesn’t hang tight.\"\n\nContact Jamie L. LaReau at 313-222-2149 or jlareau@freepress.com.

In addition, Hyundai dealers will inspect the control modules and replace them if needed. Hyundai will mail notification letters starting April 5, and Kia will send them March 31.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says owners can go www.nhtsa.gov and enter their 17-digit vehicle identification number to see if their automobile is being recalled.\n\nHyundai said that when it finds a safety defect \"we act swiftly and efficiently to recall the vehicle and fix the problem at no cost to affected customers.\"\n\nKia said there are warning signs that drivers could see or smell. The antilock brake warning light could come on, and they could smell something burning or melting, or see smoke coming from the engine compartment.\n\nTuesday's recalls come after U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stepped up a series of investigations into engine compartment fires that have plagued the Korean automakers.\n\nIn December, the agency consolidated two investigations from 2017 into a new a new engineering analysis covering more than 3 million vehicles from the 2011 through 2016 model years. At the time, NHTSA had received 161 complaints of engine fires, some of which occurred in vehicles that had already been recalled.\n\nThe first recall from the companies related to engine failures and fires reaches to September 2015. Since then they have issued at least eight more recalls for a host of engine problems, according to NHTSA documents.\n\nThe agency said it's evaluating whether previous recalls covered enough vehicles. It also will monitor the effectiveness of previous recalls \"as well as the long-term viability of related programs and non-safety field actions being conducted by Hyundai and Kia.\"\n\nAt the time, the automakers said they have undertaken numerous recalls to address engine issues, including recalls, new engine monitoring technology and providing extended warranties.\n\nMichael Brooks, chief counsel for the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the recalls Tuesday are different from the engine failure problem that caused most of the previous Hyundai-Kia fire recalls. \"Although NHTSA has the authority to order a recall and potentially a buyback of all affected vehicles, the separate fire defects that have plagued millions of Hyundai vehicles across multiple model years makes this a very difficult task,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2020, NHTSA announced that Kia and Hyundai must pay $137 million in fines and for safety improvements because they moved too slowly to recall more than 1 million vehicles with engines that can fail. The fines resolved a previous probe into the companies' behavior involving recalls of multiple models dating to the 2011 model year.\n\nKia was to pay $27 million and invest $16 million in safety performance measures. Another $27 million payment will be deferred as long as Kia meets safety conditions, NHTSA said.\n\nKia denied the U.S. allegations but said it wanted to avoid a protracted legal fight.\n\nData collected by the Center for Auto Safety show more than 30 U.S. fire and engine-related recalls from Hyundai and Kia since 2015. The recalls involve more than 20 models from the 2006 through 2021 model years totaling over 8.4 million vehicles.\n\nMany of the recalls involved manufacturing defects that stopped oil from flowing through the engine block. Many involved expensive engine replacements.\n\nHyundai and Kia also did a U.S. \"product improvement campaign\" covering 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures.\n\n► Stay connected and stay informed.

It says the investigation opened May 27.\n\nDocuments filed by Ford with NHTSA say 25,538 Broncos may have this problem.\n\nThe inquiry, initially reported by Carscoops.com and FordAuthority.com, will determine whether Ford must recall its vehicles for repair. Recalls costs have been an ongoing problem at Ford, so much so that the company recently hired a quality expert to address a problem that costs the automaker billions annually.\n\nMore:Ford Pride Bronco Wildtrak is part of new tradition, attempt to shut down troll\n\nThe federal Office of Defects Investigation received petitions requesting investigation on March 17, March 18 and March 29. The petitions are under review.\n\n\"The petitioners alleged that 2021 MY Ford Broncos vehicles are experiencing loss of motive power at highway speeds with no-restart due to catastrophic engine failures,\" the federal safety agency wrote in the document posted on its website.\n\nThat engine is standard on the Wildtrak and optional on all other models except the Everglades and Raptor, on which it's not available, Car and Driver confirmed.\n\nFord told Car and Driver: \"We are aware of a select number of engines with this concern and we are investigating. If any customers are experiencing issues, they will be covered under the vehicle's five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. We will cooperate with the NHTSA as we always do.\"\n\nAlarming customer experiences\n\nThe federal agency has reports from all over the U.S. on its incident reporting site, including Michigan, Ohio, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nevada. Here are some of them:\n\nA Granite Bay, California, driver wrote May 5: \"My wife was driving the vehicle and was enveloped in smoke and the engine stopped and she was stuck in the middle lane of a busy road in rush hour. A dangerous section of road a few miles from our house. I drove down and gave her my SUV and then called AAA who towed it to the dealership. The motor was dead. The vehicle was towed to Future Ford of Sacramento. They then diagnosed it a few days later and informed us that it is a complete engine failure and that it will take several months to get the vehicle back to us. There were no warning lights or any warning prior to the engine stopping and a large amount of smoke to the point that my wife thought the whole vehicle was on fire. Four people stopped to help her and get her to the side of the road.\"\n\nA Whiteland, Indiana, driver wrote May 3: \"At 2,000 miles the engine dropped a valve. Vehicle has already received a new engine. Vehicle shut off running down the interstate.\"\n\nA Farmington Hills driver wrote March 14: \"I was driving to work on the morning of March 14, 2022, on the highway approx. 70 mph. I felt a falter or engine buck, I began to lose power to the engine. ... I was able to make the additional 10 miles to my workplace. When I stopped at the gate for security, the engine died and I was unable to restart it.\n\nA Rochester, New York, driver wrote March 13: \"I was on cruise control going about 70 yesterday when I lost all power at the gas pedal. I made it to the side of the highway and waited 90 minutes for a tow truck to come get me. I had my dogs with me and it was 25 degrees out. We were three hours from home. The service department reported today that I had a catastrophic engine failure. A valve came loose and was crushed by the pistons or some such.\"\n\nA Park City, Utah, driver wrote on Valentine's Day: \"Was driving my son to school, maybe 30 mph when all of a sudden I heard some clicking noises from the engine. The power dropped and I was barely able to pull over to the side of the busy road out of harms way. Engine dead. Only warning lights I got were a forward sensor failure and then a message telling me to pull over put it in park and restart. I tried but I was not able to restart. ... Dealer confirmed a dropped valve and engine failure. Awaiting a replacement engine.\"\n\nA Middleburg, Florida, driver wrote Jan. 19, \"broke down with 2058 miles. Flashing engine light, strong fumes smell and vigorously shaking. Ford customer care said there’s nothing they could do. Not even a loaner for a $63k vehicle.\"\n\nReports of problems filed on the federal agency are monitored by automotive companies and federal regulators who look for trends and need for action to prevent crashes.\n\nNot the first recall\n\nThe 2021 Bronco has two recalls already: one issued in October affected potentially 553 vehicles for passenger air bag deployment problems and another issued in December for a misaligned radar module that could prevent the vehicle from maintaining a safe distance from vehicles while using adaptive cruise control. In addition, the federal safety site said, \"The automatic braking system may react slowly, or not react at all, during a pre-collision assist braking event.\"\n\nThe Ford Bronco has a long waiting list and has proved to be popular with consumers. It is designed to compete with the Jeep Wrangler as an off-road adventure vehicle. The Bronco began shipping to customers a year ago.

The brick term has been coined by Mach-E forum members seeking advice from one another online.\n\nThe March 25 technical service bulletin filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration describes the situation in more technical terms: \"12-Volt Battery Becomes Discharged While The Vehicle Is Plugged In During The High Voltage Charging Process.\"\n\nDischarging, or draining, describes the process of a battery losing energy.\n\nWhen this happens, Mach-E customers get notified by their FordPass app that the Mach-E is in \"deep sleep\" mode, TheVerge noted.\n\nThe issue affects vehicles built on or before Feb. 3, Ford said. While the company has touted the potential for over-the-air updates, this fix requires a dealer visit.\n\nThe Ford bulletin said the problem may be related to the powertrain control module. The company told Reuters the situation is a \"software glitch, which results in the small battery discharging while a larger high-voltage battery pack is charging.\"\n\nThe Dearborn automaker declined to say how many Mach-E owners are affected. The company reported selling three vehicles in December, 238 in January and 3,739 in February.\n\n\"We are aware that a small number of Mustang Mach-E owners have had their 12-volt battery reach a low-voltage condition. We proactively worked with early owners experiencing this issue to identify the root cause and a fix,\" said Ford spokeswoman Emma Bergg. \"In the rare instances where this still occurs, customers can now contact their local EV-certified Ford dealer to have the matter resolved.\"\n\nMichelle Phillips, 52, a research field manager from Ontario, California, experienced firsthand a dead battery in her garage in March. She had owned the car one month.\n\nShe drove on a Friday, let her car sit over the weekend plugged into a charger.\n\n“The doors were popped open, which was odd. I thought I forgot to close them,” she told the Free Press on Friday. “When I went to get in, the power was completely dead. I thought, ‘Now what?’ ”\n\nPhillips called her Ford dealer and she said they had no idea what to do. They suggested sending a tow truck. She had a battery charger but couldn’t find the battery, which is hidden in the front trunk known as a \"frunk,\" where the internal combustion engine would be. When Ford roadside assistance arrived, the operator was unfamiliar with the Mach-E and afraid he’d break something. They finally figured it all out and jumped her battery.\n\n'It was a miracle'\n\n“All of a sudden, everything came to life. It was a miracle. It was a full charge,\" Phillips said. \"I wanted to know what happened. So I took it to the dealership. They kept it the following weekend and said basically everything was fine.”\n\nAfter she took her Mach-E home, the dealership called and asked her to bring it back for software update. It’s what she figured they needed initially. The dealer consulted Ford engineering. She took a loaner Mach-E. Everything has been fine ever since then.\n\nBut she voiced a bigger concern about Ford customer communications.\n\nPhillips, who ordered her vehicle in November 2019, picked it up on Feb. 8. For a period of time, neither she nor the dealership could track the vehicle online.\n\n“I called Ford corporate to find out what was going on,” she said. “They said it needed QC (quality checks). I got the car with 28 miles on it. That’s serious quality checks. Why can’t they say what’s going on? I spent close to $60,000 on a car that I hadn’t seen before, I had never driven and I am putting 100% faith in Ford. I need them to be more transparent and up front. That’s what they promised.”\n\nAs early adopters of a hot new product with new technology, she said, people aren’t bothered by little issues but they don’t want to guess and beg for information.\n\n“But don’t tell me it’s nothing when I know it’s not nothing,” she said. “I’ve got a car that was sent out to California and then shipped all the way to Kansas, for what?”\n\nPeople have stopped to ask her questions and take pictures of the beautiful car, and Phillips is happy she made the purchase.\n\nOn Jan. 17, the Free Press reported that Ford was holding the Mach-E for additional quality review. Bergg estimated the hold would last up to eight weeks for \"several hundred\" vehicles after being built at the factory in Cuautitlán, Izcalli, Mexico.\n\nOn March 2, Ford notified thousands of Mach-E customers they would be compensated for their patience as the company continued its quality checks.\n\nBy mid-March, some customers in Norway reached out about delivery delays.\n\n\"We began deliveries in the U.S. at the end of 2020, as planned, and are on track to begin deliveries starting in spring in Europe,\" Bergg said at the time. \"Ford is committed to delivering a high-quality vehicle, so delivery timing will vary by market.\"\n\nThe Mach-E is an especially valuable vehicle to Ford as its debut vehicle designed to challenge Tesla, the dominant player in the all-electric market.\n\nThe Mach-E won 2021 North American Utility of the Year and a Morgan Stanley analyst said first quarter sales illustrate a horse race with Tesla. Ford said it sold 6,614 Mach-E SUVs. Meanwhile, Tesla reported 184,800 vehicles sold during the first three months of the year, twice as many as a year ago, with strong demand in China.\n\nF-150 battery woes\n\nThis Mach-E situation is the second battery-related issue raised with Ford on new products in 2021. Some customers and dealerships saw dead 12-volt batteries on the brand-new 2021 Ford F-150 pickups due to phantom battery drain, as first reported on Feb. 15 by the Free Press.\n\nMore:Jim Hackett kept $16.7M pay package in 2020, stepped down as Ford CEO\n\n\"A population of vehicles built before we began shipping to dealers require a software update to prevent batteries from losing their charge,\" Ford spokesman Said Deep said at the time.\n\nHe said Friday that the battery issues had no relation to one another, as he understands the situation.\n\nFord declined to explain why the 12-volt batteries were losing juice or how many vehicles potentially had a problem.\n\n\"My truck went into deep sleep mode once and the only way to bring it back to life was a jump start,\" one F-150 owner wrote on a forum. \"Had to use the physical key in the fob to open the door.\"\n\nThat situation also required a visit to the dealership for a software update.\n\nThe F-150 was held for additional quality updates, too.\n\nMach-E repair instructions\n\nFixing the Mach-E battery cannot be done at home as it requires specific software programs. Ford explicitly writes in the service bulletin: \"The procedures should not be performed by 'do-it-yourselfers.' \"\n\nThis is the protocol for professional technicians:\n\nConnect a battery charger to the 12-volt battery.\n\nVerify that the negative cable of the charger is installed on a chassis or engine ground, and not the 12-volt battery negative terminal to prevent the battery saver mode from activating on the vehicle. Do not have the vehicle plugged into the High Voltage battery charger during programming. This can cause modules to not program correctly. Only have the 12-volt battery charger installed.\n\nReprogram the powertrain control module using the latest software level of the appropriate Ford diagnostic scan tool.\n\nUpdating only one module at a time, check the secondary onboard diagnostic control module; the battery energy control module; the secondary onboard diagnostic control module B; the secondary onboard diagnostic control module C; and the antilock brake system.\n\nSoftware problems have presented ongoing headaches for automakers globally and often come up in consumer satisfaction surveys and reports to federal safety regulators.\n\nMore:Ford makes come-from-behind push with Mach-E as industry enters new era\n\nMore:Tesla owner spends $160 driving cross-country in all-electric 2021 Mustang Mach-E\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

In November, he defeated teams racing in pairs while driving his 1978 Lola 106 mph solo. Farley understands cars and fighting to win.\n\nHe took the helm of Ford nearly four months ago, exactly 112 years after the first Model T was built on Oct. 1, 1908. Production of 15 million Model T's over 19 years transformed America forever.\n\nAnd now it's happening again.\n\nWith new leadership in Washington, the automotive industry says it will see rapid adoption of revolutionary changes.\n\nF-150 dominance\n\nFord, as the maker of America's popular F-150 pickup, appreciates the tradition of pumping gas into the internal combustion engine, often called ICE, as well as anyone. The F-Series franchise is widely praised as a successful company within a company, generating an estimated $50 billion each year.\n\nYet more than a dozen state governments, led by California and its billions in spending power, as well as Europe and Asia, are pushing auto companies to build all-electric vehicles that require pumping electricity instead.\n\nNot only are states and countries providing incentives to make the change, but they're issuing restrictions on sales of vehicles that don't. In California and several other states, electric vehicles can use speed lanes during rush hours and shorten commute times.\n\nTesla, run by billionaire Elon Musk, is established as the all-electric leader with four popular models that run on batteries, building a record 499,000 vehicles in 2020.\n\n\"The auto industry is undergoing the most significant technological change in nearly 100 years. If the established companies do not make this transition, they're going to go out of business,\" said John McElroy, \"Autoline\" host and veteran industry analyst.\n\n\"Tesla has shown that startups can thrive and steal sales from traditional automakers. We all know Tesla is the most valuable car company in the world. Tesla, alone, is bigger than the entire American auto industry,\" he said.\n\nTesla is valued at $802 billion, compared with Ford at $45 billion or General Motors at nearly $79 billion.\n\nFor Ford, it is Farley, the grandson of a Model T factory worker, who is guiding the company through \"the last days of the ICE Age\" to electrification, a term used by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in his Dec. 2 note to investors.\n\nStrategic timing\n\n\"Financial markets, for sure, are seeing the e-mobility revolution happen,\" Farley told the Free Press. \"In December, in Europe, 1 of 10 vehicles sold was a pure electric. Not plug-in or hybrid but pure electric. China has been on this increase for a long time. This is a reality. Customers are moving to e-mobility.\"\n\nFord has made fewer headlines than its crosstown rival GM in the race for electric dominance. GM CEO Mary Barra often wins praise from Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and others for her plan to bring 30 electric vehicles to market in five years.\n\nFarley isn't fazed by the attention heaped on competitors. He said Ford is focused in a way that others aren't and while they talk about plans, Ford is not just executing but winning critical reviews for its first product specifically designed to challenge Tesla: the Mustang Mach-E, which began shipping from its plant in Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico, at the end of 2020.\n\n\"Ford's electrification strategy is not like others,\" Farley said. \"We're going to have very emotional vehicles. We're electrifying our most iconic vehicles. Everyone knows what a Mustang sounds like and feels like. This Mach-E is a different kind of Mustang, but it's still a Mustang.\"\n\nNow is the first inning of the electrification game, and the company isn't planning to compete in every market segment but instead dominate areas of established strength, he said.\n\nFarley is pushing his team to break constraints and improve battery capacity, get more electric vehicles into the product cycle plan for future years and grow the volume of vehicles that can be manufactured given the anticipated demand for the Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit van and the 2022 all-electric F-150.\n\nEverything fuels the electrification strategy at Ford, including the Jan. 11 announcement to close three plants in Brazil. That move allows the company to reprioritize spending and bring customers \"connectivity, electrification and autonomous technologies.\"\n\nThe automaker has essentially abandoned cars to focus on trucks and SUVs, which have generated strong revenue and record per-vehicle transaction prices.\n\nFord will be electrifying its most recognizable SUVs too, Farley said, though he declined to provide detail. As the market floods with options, Ford wants to stand out and have its specific products established as nameplates before pivoting to electric nameplates.\n\n\"That's very specific to Ford,\" Farley said. \"Mach-E is coming out after Tesla but before others. You don't see any vehicle out there that has Detroit swagger that's affordable. Mach-E is $35,000 with the ($7,500) federal incentive.\"\n\nBest in North America\n\nThe company celebrated this month when 50 jurors awarded the 117-year-old carmaker two of three wins in the most competitive categories in the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year awards. The 2021 F-150 and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E – not as an electric vehicle winner but as the best utility overall.\n\n\"It's here now, and we're selling it,\" Farley said. \"We have a great order bank.\"\n\nFord hasn't released Mach-E sales numbers yet.\n\nEmma Bergg, a Ford spokeswoman, said Thursday, \"While we aren’t providing details, we expect sales to be around 50,000 globally in the first year of production.\"\n\nOver-the-air updates will add features including a hands-free driving system. Onboard navigation will plot cross-country routes for battery-charging stops. The base model can go 230 miles on a charge, extended-range models up to 300.\n\nThe hot new SUVs won't fill dealerships; they'll be made to order. This was the first time Ford had ever launched a product through a reservation process, anticipating intense demand. California is leading that demand in the U.S.\n\nThe Golden State accounted for 256,800 electric vehicle registrations or nearly 47% of the national total as of the end of 2018, according to IHS Markit data. Washington state came in second with 28,400. Michigan had just 4,210.\n\n\"GM, Ford and Chrysler face an existential threat,\" McElroy, the analyst, said. \"If they don't figure out how to compete in the electric market, they're going to go out of business.\"\n\nFact is, GM saw its stock price climb to historic heights – past $50 – after its CEO gave a keynote speech on Jan. 12 at the Consumer Electronics Show outlining plans for the future.\n\n\"GM has a pretty damn good strategy and it's way ahead of Ford and everybody else right now,\" McElroy said. \"Among traditional automakers, GM is clearly in the lead. Ford is definitely behind.\"\n\nFarley offered a different perspective.\n\n\"We are the first and only company that I see that will offer an electric van and an electric pickup truck in 24 months,\" he said. \"That's not come from behind. We're the first. We are the dominant player.\"\n\nNonetheless, Jonas wrote to Morgan Stanley investors on Nov. 25, despite Ford’s “sense of urgency” the automaker’s electric vehicle strategy \"is still not fully clear to us.”\n\nThere's no turning back now.\n\n\"It's getting more and more serious,\" McElroy said. \"Cities and countries are actually banning the internal combustion engine. England moved up from 2035 to 2030. Automakers all of a sudden are like, wait, what do you mean a ban? Market forces aren't driving this tipping point to EVs yet.\"\n\nThe industry, though, is also seeing n historic shift in how it makes money. For more than a century, automakers profited solely off vehicle sales. Now the business model is patterned after Facebook and Google, which monetize data and information about consumers.\n\nThe vision is not to make money just on each car sale but on digital services and collecting useful data.\n\n\"That's where the world is going,\" McElroy said. \"BMW is toying with the idea of having a monthly charge for when customers want to use electric heated seats\" instead of just buying the option once, for example.\n\nAnother big twist in the value of auto companies is the need to constantly find ways to grow earnings, Jonas said on Dec. 3 during a speech to the Florida Automated Vehicles Summit. The amount of time people spend in their cars, billions of hours, is coveted by the tech industry that wants to take that information and make money.\n\nThis follows the same model as Facebook and Google, which don't charge users for their services but instead charge for access to eyeballs using the products.\n\nFord wants to monetize information about driver habits.\n\nAs a dominant player in the commercial sector, Ford can take driver information and learn things about business needs, like the average route is 74 miles, Farley said. That helps Ford forecast battery life needed for company vans or provide over air alerts digitally when vehicles need service, to avoid unplanned repair time. It's an incredible competitive advantage, he said.\n\n\"This goes way beyond the product. The product is a commodity; it's a box on wheels,\" Farley said. \"It's customized interiors, digital experience, e-service networks so you're never down.\"\n\n'Greater questions'\n\nBy focusing nearly exclusively on electric, GM seems to be positioned well long term, said analyst Dan Levy at Credit Suisse.\n\n\"You're ultimately looking at earnings power. Not just what the earnings power is this year or next year but the earnings power down the line. This is about opportunity for cash flow generation, position for the future. We're in a market that places a premium on narrative and focuses on growth,\" he said.\n\n\"We view GM as better positioned and others generally do, too,\" Levy said. \"At Ford, there are greater questions about their long-term ability to make this transition. I do think investors have come to better appreciate Ford's potential under Jim Farley. But there's still much more work ahead.\"\n\nHowever, Farley said Ford's commercial-vehicle strength in Europe is a plus in terms of data analytics; Just wait, Wall Street will see, he says confidently.\n\nBut analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush wrote in his Jan. 14 investor note, \"While there are 150-plus automakers aggressively going after the EV opportunity globally, right now we believe it’s Tesla’s world and everyone else is paying rent.\"\n\nWhite House effect\n\nWith a new administration that acknowledges the science of climate change and vows to invest in transitioning the auto industry to cleaner technology, analysts say this can only help the Detroit Three and the industry overall.\n\nFor now, Tesla is a big player in California, home to 1 in 6 consumers, McCabe noted.\n\nThe landscape will change dramatically if President Joe Biden fulfills his goal to transform the infrastructure and invest in charging stations and consumer incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAlready in California, Ford has been recognized by Gov. Gavin Newsom as an ally in the push toward improving air quality.\n\nCalifornia dreaming\n\n\"Ford has been a leader from Day 1, saying, 'This is our future and we're going to collaborate with California.' Honda came on early, too,\" Jared Blumenfeld, CalEPA secretary, told the Free Press. \"The game is going to be about 2026 and beyond. What you're seeing is an alignment of interests with auto manufacturers and regulators. That alignment didn't exist between the Trump administration but it does with the Biden administration. It's a huge positive economic opportunity.\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't want to sugarcoat it too much. When autos and the Biden administration sit down to hash out how to move forward, there will still be pushback against California with some people saying we're too ambitious. But at least it's a conversation where we're all starting from a place that climate change is real, and electric vehicles are going to be a large part of the equation.\"\n\nWhile Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen sided with California in July 2019 in an effort to set its own clean air standards, GM, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Toyota and other automakers sided with the Trump administration's attempt to overturn the California standards.\n\nBill Ford, executive chairman, an advocate of sustainability since he joined Ford Motor in 1979, played an instrumental role in his company's decision to stand with California.\n\nOpposing the state's efforts was a shocking strategy for GM and Toyota, given their vocal commitments to sustainability, California officials said.\n\n\"It was actually shameful,\" Blumenfeld said. \"This was only about short-term political benefit. And it was damaging to our relationships with them.\"\n\nAfter Biden won the election, GM switched sides. CEO Barra put out a letter that her company would no longer support the Trump administration and urged other automakers to do the same. The move came as a surprise to Toyota and then-FCA.\n\n\"GM went rogue and said, 'We're out of the deal,' \" said a source close to the situation who was not authorized to speak to the media but confirmed the treatment of FCA and Toyota. \"Mary Barra issued a public letter saying, 'We're out and urge our old teammates to join us.' We were blindsided.\"\n\nGM said the company notified fellow automakers immediately prior to announcing its new position.\n\nThe alignment with the Trump administration's position \"was always about wanting a national program and wanting to be part of that conversation,\" said Jeannine Ginivan, GM manager of public policy communications.\n\n\"With the president-elect putting out some pretty ambitious electrification goals – charging stations, building back better, manufacturing electric vehicles in the U.S., positioning the American autoworker to win the race for electrification and Gavin Newsom talking about going all-electric by 2035 – we're seeing an alignment between the future administration and California that we did not see before,\" Ginivan said.\n\nThe sudden move by GM also caught observers by surprise.\n\n\"It was all politics,\" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive. \"They’re all in on EVs – and then supporting the Trump administration and fighting California. It seemed odd to me. The only thing you can assume is they didn’t want to upset the Trump administration.\"\n\nAt the time, Farley tweeted about GM 'reversing course.'\n\n'Remember this'\n\nInauguration Day was a critical inflection point.\n\n\"What you're seeing is a realignment and reshuffling of interests,\" Blumenfeld said. \"The Department of Justice is saying we're no longer going to be part of a lawsuit against California. The former Trump administration position of the EPA not granting a waiver to California is being reversed by Biden, very likely. And that changes the political landscape.\"\n\nCalifornia long has been an aggressive leader on air quality. Back in 1970, then-President Richard Nixon, a California Republican, created the Environmental Protection Agency that established clean air and water oversight.\n\nDespite the fact that Barra praised the Biden plan to invest in technology needed to support electric car growth, the influential Sacramento Bee wrote a scathing editorial on Nov. 24 that urged readers: \"GM sided with Trump against California.

Tesla outsells Ford by the thousands.\n\n\"We see the Mach-E as being a competitor to Tesla,\" she said, with more than 50 orders in the system.\n\nThen and now\n\nBack in Detroit, on that cloudy afternoon earlier this month, Farley looked at his watch and wondered about Piquette Plant visitor hours, thinking he might be able to walk the museum, which is no longer owned by Ford but has been run as a nonprofit for 20 years by the Model-T Automotive Heritage Complex.\n\n\"Do I have time just to look through the cars?\" Farley asked David Flatt, executive director of the museum, who nodded.\n\nThe executive zigzagged among dozens of Fords – Model A, Model B, Model C, Model F, Model K, Model N and Model R, Model S and Model T. He zeroed in on the fancy Model K, built before the Model T and selling for $2,800 at the time.\n\nThe Piquette Plant was the first factory to build more than 100 cars in a single day, which began with the Model N. Everyone knows the Model T because it was the most successful of the letter cars, which initially sold for $850 and eventually dropped to $265.\n\nFarley was reading placards aloud and laughing and sharing his own stories about Ford history and evolution of the vehicles, materials used to make them and prices. He talked about mistakes and discoveries to a new aide in an otherwise empty museum near closing time.\n\n\"Did you know snowmobiles came from Model T's?\" Farley said, pointing to a car on blades.\n\nHe went off for a bit, to be alone with the cars. And then returned.\n\nChevy vs. Ford\n\n\"In '30 or '31, or even earlier, Henry said, 'Chevrolet's got that more powerful engine than us, so we've got to come out with a V8. So he took the people, they had to leave Ford, they had to quit Ford, and he found a place in Greenfield Village where they worked. It was a separate garage,\" Farley said, walking between cars like a professor in a classroom, pointing to the different vehicles and design materials.\n\n\"They were sequestered and couldn't tell anyone what they were working on. They came up with all these different kinds of V8s until they settled on the flathead, which went into this car the next year, '32. Totally changed Ford,\" Farley said. \"That was the car Bonnie and Clyde said, 'This is a great car for a robber.' \"\n\nHe then paused at the sight of a sexy sleek silver 2004 Ford GT \"Halo\" race car, which cost $150,000 and clocked in at 211 mph – inspired by Ford's 1960s GT-40 race cars.\n\nDespite the passing of time, Ford remains committed to speed, style and innovation.\n\nNo looking back\n\n\"I grew up with the internal combustion engine and I race cars. I love cars, love working on them,\" Farley said.\n\n\"The electric car, I would just say, is a better car, in a way. You eliminate 30 to 40% of the parts. Those are the ones that break and are expensive to repair. The inside has more room. You get new space up front, a frunk, a front trunk. It's a digital vehicle, so you can tune the car really easily with software. You can make the car better with over the air updates,\" he said. \"It happens while you're sleeping.\"\n\n\"It's just a better car.\"\n\nMore:No one knew secret behind Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Bronco Sport — until now\n\nMore:Iconic Detroit midcentury modern design themes inspire Mustang Mach-E\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

The other is an infant who is not a US resident. Public health officials are investigating how the children were infected.\n\nBoth have symptoms but are in good health and receiving treatment with an antiviral medication named tecovirimat or TPOXX, which the CDC recommends for children under the age of 8 because they are considered to be at higher risk from infection.\n\nSince the monkeypox outbreak began in May, most of the cases have happened among men who have sex with men. However, anyone can catch the virus through close skin-to-skin contact. In the case of children, the agency said this could include \"holding, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups, and utensils.\"\n\nThe CDC says the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine is being made available for children through special expanded use protocols. The agency has also developed new guidance for health care providers about identifying, treating and preventing monkeypox in children and teens.\n\nDr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, said Friday that the cases in children were not surprising and that the US should be ready to respond to more.\n\n\"The social networks that we have as humans mean that we have contact with a lot of different people. And while this outbreak is spreading in a particular social network right now, I think we've messaged from the start that there could be cases that occur outside those networks and that we need to be vigilant for it and ready to respond and message about it,\" she said.\n\n\"I know that in Europe and other places where this outbreak is also expanding, they have reported cases in children, in women. And I think the same thing is happening and expected to happen here in the United States,\" she said.\n\n\"There is no evidence to date that we're seeing this virus spread outside of those populations to any degree,\" McQuiston said.\n\nVaccine supply improves\n\nThe US government has shipped 300,000 monkeypox vaccines to US states and territories as of Friday afternoon.\n\n\"That means hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to be getting vaccinated in a matter of days or weeks,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said Friday. \"Jurisdictions, states territories, cities are getting their vaccines typically about 30 hours after ordering them.\"\n\nJha said Friday that New York City had received enough monkeypox vaccine to provide at least one dose to about half its eligible population, while DC had gotten enough to provide one dose to 70% of its eligible population.\n\nThe newly released doses increase available supply, but they cover just a small portion of the eligible population. The CDC estimates that more than 1.5 million people are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine.\n\nThe prescribing information for the Jynneos vaccine says a full course is two shots given four weeks apart. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration have said that people need both doses to fully prevent disease.\n\nBut in New York City and some other places seeing a high degree of viral spread, officials have been giving out a first shot to as many people as they can, even before second doses are available.\n\nThat strategy makes sense, Jha said Friday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"The FDA and CDC clearly believe that people need two doses. And the reason that New York and many other places have been able to move forward with a first dose out to everybody, is because we've been able to show them that more doses are coming and that second doses will be able to be given to people,\" he said. \"So given that, we encourage people to go ahead and use up all their doses as first doses.\"\n\nPeople are eligible to be vaccinated for monkeypox if they know that they were exposed to the virus or if they suspect that they were exposed because they had multiple sexual partners or were at an event where monkeypox is known to have spread.\n\n\"We continue to see the majority of cases in the United States as being reported among individuals who identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men,\" McQuiston said.

And in New York City, one patient has tested positive for orthopoxvirus, the family of viruses to which monkeypox belongs, NYC health officials announced in a news release Friday.\n\nThe case is being treated as a \"presumptive positive\" case until confirmed pending CDC testing and the patient is currently isolating, the release states.\n\nNew York City health officials had also tested one other patient for monkeypox, but that case has been ruled out, health officials said. City officials have been working with state authorities from the New York State Department of Health in their investigation of the two cases, both of which were identified Thursday.\n\nNew York State Health Commissioner Dr. Mary T. Bassett said in a statement Friday that \"the current risk to the public is low.\"\n\n\"Reports of suspected cases of monkeypox in the United States and elsewhere are concerning. While a possible case in New York State awaits confirmatory testing by our local and federal partners, the Department has alerted health care providers in New York State so that they can consider this unusual diagnosis if their patients present with symptoms,\" Bassett said.\n\nMeanwhile, recent monkeypox infections have been identified in several other regions around the world where the virus is not usually common, including Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Northern Ireland and Spain.\n\n\"We have a level of scientific concern about what we're seeing because this is a very unusual situation. Monkeypox is normally only reported in West Africa or Central Africa, and we don't see it in the United States or in Europe -- and the number of cases that are being reported is definitely outside the level of normal for what we would see,\" Jennifer McQuiston , deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology within the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"At the same time, there really aren't that many cases that are being reported -- I think maybe a dozen, a couple dozen -- so, the general public should not be concerned that they are at immediate risk for monkeypox,\" she said. \"We're working through the investigations.\"\n\nOverall, \"we have people who are being monitored for diseases all the time,\" CDC spokesperson Christine Pearson wrote in an email, Thursday. That means that if someone might have been exposed to a pathogen, their health is monitored, and they should see physicians if they develop symptoms.\n\nAs for the six people currently being monitored for potential monkeypox, they all \"are healthy, with no symptoms and are considered at low risk for monkeypox,\" Pearson wrote, adding that none were seated next to the ill passenger and none had direct contact.\n\nAs the CDC's investigation continues, discussions have started to include the topic of vaccines.\n\nCDC 'discussing and evaluating' smallpox vaccine\n\nCDC officials are evaluating whether smallpox vaccine should be offered to healthcare workers treating monkeypox patients and other people who may be at \"high risk\" for exposure to monkeypox, McQuiston said.\n\n\"It's definitely something that we're discussing and evaluating, whether offering smallpox vaccine makes sense in the current setting,\" she said. \"We'll be closer to making recommendations for that in the next day or so.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How vaccines stop the spread of viruses Replay More Videos ...

But cases have been identified that were associated with international travel or importing animals from areas where the disease is more common. After the virus jumps from an animal to a human, human-to-human transmission of monkeypox can occur when a person encounters the virus through direct contact to: large respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, or lesions on the skin.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic of the disease is that it can cause lesions and a rash on the body , including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n\n\"This is not a disease that is going to sweep across the country,\" Dr. Daniel Bausch, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"From a public health angle, of course, we need to investigate and respond -- I think the general population should just be aware of this -- but there's certainly no reason to panic and I think it's highly, highly, highly unlikely that we will get any sort of large outbreak of this,\" he said. \"And if you haven't had contact in Massachusetts and you're not related to the person who had disease or in that link at all -- until we have any other reason to expect or to understand how this disease got into the United States -- your risk of getting monkeypox is really low.\"\n\nA monkeypox mystery\n\nIn Massachusetts, physicians donning the same personal protective equipment they wear for Covid-19 patients have been treating the US monkeypox patient at a special pathogens unit within Massachusetts General Hospital, where he originally was diagnosed.\n\n\"They were undergoing a workup related to symptoms and the infectious diseases physician seeing the patient, learning about some of the cases in the United Kingdom, decided that the patient could possibly have monkeypox,\" Dr. Erica Shenoy, medical director for the Regional Emerging Special Pathogens Treatment Center and associate chief of the infection control unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"Then we had discussions with our state public health officials. The decision was made that yes, they did meet criteria for testing,\" Shenoy said. The patient tested positive.\n\n\"I think to the public overall, there really is no clear risk at this point,\" Shenoy said. \"This is an evolving situation that we're looking to understand better -- why these clusters that have been reported as well in the UK and in Portugal and Spain are happening, and to better understand the epidemiology.\"\n\nBoth in the United Kingdom and Canada, health authorities have noted that many of the monkeypox cases were identified in men who have sex with men -- but the virus is not typically described as a sexually transmitted infection and investigations into these recent cases continue.\n\nMonkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like illness were seen in colonies of monkeys that were kept for research, leading to the name \"monkeypox,\" according to the CDC. The first human case of monkeypox was reported years later in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a time when intense efforts were underway to eliminate smallpox.\n\nIn the United States, the last outbreak of monkeypox recorded was in 2003, when 47 confirmed and probable cases were reported in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin. \"No instances of monkeypox infection were attributed exclusively to person-to-person contact,\" according to CDC.\n\nAll of the people infected with monkeypox during that outbreak became ill after having contact with pet prairie dogs, the CDC found. Those pets were housed at an animal vendor's facilities in Illinois where they may have been infected with the virus. The facilities housed other small mammals imported from Ghana that tested positive for monkeypox virus: two African giant pouched rats, nine dormice and three rope squirrels.\n\n\"The prairie dogs got monkeypox from the imported animals and then passed it on to the humans,\" Bausch said. \"It's a bit of a misnomer calling it monkeypox. The reservoir for this virus, the natural reservoir in nature is probably certain types of rodents.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday that people should not be worried about monkeypox at this point, but that they should be aware of symptoms and when to reach out for help.\n\nMurthy explained on CNN's New Day that monkeypox is rare in humans, \"but when it does come up, it's a serious one that we should investigate, and we've got to make sure that we understand if and how it is spreading from person to person.\"\n\nSymptoms generally are similar to the flu, he told CNN's John Berman and Erica Hill.\n\n\"The good news is we have one confirmed case right now. But we should always be on the lookout for more cases,\" he said. \"At this time, we don't want people to worry. At this point, again, these numbers are still small -- we want them to be aware of these symptoms and if they have any concerns to reach out to their doctor.\"", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/health/monkeypox-testing-demand/index.html", "title": "Testing is crucial to getting monkeypox under control, but there's a ...", "text": "(CNN) Testing for monkeypox, a crucial part of containing the growing outbreak, has gotten off to a sluggish start at the five commercial laboratories that have nearly all the US's monkeypox testing capacity, CNN has learned.\n\nMayo Clinic Laboratories, for example, has the capacity to process 1,000 monkeypox samples a week but has received only 45 specimens from doctors since starting monkeypox testing July 11. Another of the labs, Aegis Sciences Corp., can do 5,000 tests per week but has received zero samples over the past two weeks. At Labcorp, one of the largest commercial labs in the US, uptake has been higher but still \"extremely low,\" according to Dr. Brian Caveney, the lab's president of diagnostics.\n\nThose numbers are \"shocking,\" said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a member of the California Department of Public Health's Monkeypox Virus Scientific Advisory Committee.\n\n\"This is really, really concerning. It's like Covid PTSD,\" he said, referring to the early phase of the pandemic when coronavirus testing was extremely limited. While the anxiety is the same, the reasons are different because for Covid-19, the testing capacity was low, and for monkeypox, the capacity is plentiful but the demand is low.\n\nThe first US monkeypox case in this outbreak was reported May 17, and the virus has spread rapidly to reach 4,639 probable or confirmed cases , nearly all of them in men who have sex with men. Getting the outbreak under control has been a challenge for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Biden administration, which is expected to name a monkeypox coordinator and has been considering whether to declare the virus a public health emergency.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, described testing as a \"pillar\" of the government's monkeypox response Tuesday on CNN. He and other health officials have repeatedly assured Americans that there's high capacity to handle testing, with labs capable of processing 80,000 specimens per week. Most of that capacity -- 70,000 specimens -- is in the private labs.\n\nThe CDC engaged the five labs to handle the growing case numbers. Two of them, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare, declined to tell CNN how many monkeypox specimens they've received, but \"capacity at the five commercial labs at this point far exceeds what we are seeing in demand,\" according to Susan Van Meter, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association.\n\nTesting is a major part of the monkeypox containment effort for two reasons: It's the first step to identifying and isolating patients, and it gives public health officials an idea of the scope of the outbreak and which geographic areas need the most resources.\n\n\"Without testing, you're flying blind,\" said Dr. William Morice, chair of the board of directors of the American Clinical Laboratory Association and president of Mayo's lab. \"The biggest concern is that you're not going to identify cases and [monkeypox] could become an endemic illness in this country. That's something we really have to worry about.\"\n\nChin-Hong likened the low lab numbers to \"walking around with Vaseline in your eyes: You're not seeing the whole picture.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Hardison, senior vice president of Aegis, cautions that \"if you're not doing enough testing, you're not going to find it, and it will continue to spread, and we're already seeing significant growth in a number of different states around the country right now.\"\n\nA steep learning curve\n\nBefore this year, there had been just a few dozen cases of monkeypox in the United States. As with any newly emerging pathogen, the CDC has set out to educate health care providers how to detect the disease, order tests for it and treat it.\n\nThe agency has sent emails through its Health Alert Network , hosted two calls attended by more than 17,000 doctors and other clinicians, and set up a phone line for physicians to ask questions. The CDC has also sent out emails to physicians announcing the availability of testing at the five private labs.\n\nA CDC spokesperson said there has been \"robust outreach to clinicians and the general public to increase awareness of monkeypox risk factors, symptoms and testing options.\"\n\nJAMA and other medical journals have also offered information about how to diagnose, test for and treat monkeypox.\n\n\"The message is definitely getting out there,\" said a federal health adviser who requested anonymity because they're not a government employee and they don't speak for any federal agency. \"Our hope is that every clinical provider in this country now knows about monkeypox and when to test.\"\n\nBut even with that education, it can be difficult to detect a case of monkeypox, in part because the rash isn't always distinctive, Caveney said.\n\n\"It just looks like a pimple or something,\" he said.\n\nBecause monkeypox is spread by prolonged skin-to-skin contact, the doctor also has to get a detailed and thorough history from their patient.\n\n\"It's really hard for clinicians to get an accurate history of someone's contact maybe a week or two ago and then to look at a lesion and say, 'Oh, this isn't just, you know, just a normal thing that would be in your skin. It's something that I should test,' \" he said.\n\nCaveney added that as doctors learn more about monkeypox, he expects testing numbers to increase.\n\nOther hurdles to testing\n\nExperts say education is only one reason for the slow adoption of testing.\n\nFor another, some people who have monkeypox symptoms may not seek care for fear of being stigmatized.\n\n\"They might think, 'I'm going to identify myself as someone who is frowned on in society: I have sex with men, I have multiple sex partners, or I didn't use protection.' That's what having monkeypox says now, and you can imagine people don't want to say all that,\" said Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UCSF School of Medicine who has treated people with monkeypox.\n\nAlso, many members of the LGBTQ community are accustomed to getting care from sexual health clinics, which are now overwhelmed treating monkeypox patients as well as their regular caseloads, according to David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, which represents public and private sexual health clinics and programs.\n\nHe said that about half of the clinics in his organization don't send specimens to private labs because it's too expensive to hire staff to manage the paperwork, which might help explain why the volume of monkeypox tests at private labs has been so low.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's very frustrating to us in the (sexually transmitted infection) field to hear information coming from the White House and the CDC about testing capacity and access to vaccines when what doesn't get discussed is all the implementation issues within your everyday clinic,\" Harvey said.\n\nThe CDC spokesperson said the agency \"encourages anyone who suspects they have monkeypox to reach out to their clinician to get tested since there is more than enough testing capacity.\"\n\nOn Monday, more than 100 members of Congress wrote a letter to the Biden administration urging additional funding for sexual health clinics to improve the monkeypox response effort.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen", "Cnn Senior Medical Correspondent"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/health/monkeypox-missing-cases/index.html", "title": "Doctors say search for monkeypox cases needs to look beyond men ...", "text": "(CNN) The man came to an urgent care clinic in New York with red bumps on his skin in an area where he had a fair amount of hair.\n\nThe doctor at the clinic diagnosed the bumps as folliculitis, an infection of the hair follicles. The clinician prescribed antibiotics and sent the man, who is in his 30s, on his way. At home, he continued to help his wife with their five children, one of whom is a newborn.\n\nDespite antibiotics, the bumps spread beyond the first pustules on his groin to his palms, arms, legs and face.\n\nAbout four days after his initial trip to the doctor, he got a fever and went back to the urgent care clinic for a second look. The doctor at the clinic consulted with Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Medical Center, who advised testing for monkeypox.\n\nA few days later, that test came back positive.\n\n\"It didn't seem to set off any alarms, and I think part of that was that this is a happily married man, works in an office. He had no reported risk factors that would have raised someone's concern, which is unfortunate,\" said Griffin, who is now treating the man and got permission to share his story. The man declined to be interviewed.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 99% of monkeypox transmission is happening between men who have sex with men, and there's no doubt that this continues to be a heavily affected community. But some infectious disease experts feel that the focus on this population may be leading clinicians to discount the signs of monkeypox in others.\n\nMonkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, but it can spread through the kind of close contact that happens in sexual and other intimate situations. In the United States and other countries, it has exploded among sexually active gay and bisexual men.\n\nAt a news briefing Friday, public health officials stressed that few cases have been diagnosed in people outside the community of men who have sex with men, and even those outside cases have been related or adjacent. The first two children in the US who were recently diagnosed with monkeypox, for example, are believed to have contracted their infections through household spread.\n\nSeparately, in a call on Saturday to educate doctors about monkeypox, Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC's monkeypox response, said there had been a case of monkeypox in a pregnant woman in the United States. Monkeypox can cross the placenta during pregnancy and infect babies in the womb. Brooks said the woman had delivered her baby and the child does not appear to have been infected. The baby was given protective antibodies called immunoglobulin as a precaution, and both mom and baby are now doing well, he said.\n\nBut that does not represent the majority of cases.\n\n\"Actually, 99% of our cases report male-to-male sexual contact,\" said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.\n\nMore than 3,500 cases of monkeypox have been diagnosed in the US. CDC officials have said they don't have detailed demographic information on all those cases.\n\n\"There is no evidence to date that we're seeing this virus spread outside of those populations to any degree,\" she added.\n\n'Our net is not wide enough'\n\nBut Griffin says it feels like the earliest days of Covid-19, when it was hard to get a test unless you could show that you had recently traveled to Wuhan, China.\n\nMonkeypox tests are available, and gay and bisexual men are appropriately being considered for testing, but many doctors still aren't aware of the risk to people outside this population, Griffin said. And that's despite outreach, webinars and health alerts to clinicians from the CDC.\n\n\"I think we're making a big mistake,\" Griffin said. \"Monkeypox is probably already outside this target population, and we're letting it spread because we're not willing to acknowledge that, because we're not doing the testing, because our net is not wide enough.\"\n\nOther experts agree.\n\n\"I'm worried that it has moved beyond this community alone,\" said Dr. David Hamer, an infectious disease specialist at Boston University who has been monitoring the monkeypox outbreak in international travelers through his GeoSentinel network of 71 sites around the world.\n\nHamer said the outbreak seems to have been fueled by three mass gatherings in Europe; at least one was a rave, where people picked up the virus and carried it home. Most of those individuals were gay and bisexual men.\n\n\"But there are others who clearly have been infected, including a few young children, and it's not quite clear how they became exposed,\" Hamer said.\n\nOne of those cases in the UK was a young child, \"and they didn't understand where and how that child acquired the infection,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be thinking more broadly. We need to educate primary care providers\" to think about monkeypox if they see someone with a rash, Hamer said.\n\nModest demand for monkeypox testing\n\nEarly the outbreak, doctors were allowed to test for monkeypox only under a narrow set of circumstances because testing capacity was limited to about 6,000 tests a week. Recently, however, the CDC has partnered with five commercial laboratories to scale up testing. When all have their programs running, they'll be able to process more than 10,000 tests a day and 80,000 tests a week.\n\nExpanding testing to commercial labs makes the process of ordering these diagnostics much easier for doctors, but there's little indication that much testing is happening outside of sexual health clinics that primarily serve the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Once it hits the commercial labs, we have a much more liberal ability to order these. Nobody is asking us to document any criteria or anything to order the test,\" said Dr. Stacy Lane, medical director of Central Outreach Wellness Center, which runs eight health clinics focused on LGBTQ wellness in Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nAlthough many of the commercial labs won't release the number of monkeypox tests they're doing, there are indications that test capacity is being underutilized.\n\nA spokesperson for Quest Diagnostics, for example, said in an email that \"we've experienced modest demand, which continues to grow.\"\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease specialist at the Emory University School of Medicine, said he didn't think primary care providers are up to speed.\n\n\"We need a lot more information and education to providers about how to use a test and what to do with it,\" del Rio said. He added that his own friends and family members were texting him pictures of their rashes, asking if they could be monkeypox.\n\nFor the most part, he says, he offers reassurance that what they have probably isn't monkeypox.\n\n\"I think it's still pretty contained in the community of men who have sex with men,\" del Rio said. \"It doesn't mean it's going to stay there.\"\n\nThe cost of misdiagnosis\n\nGriffin said his patient has no idea how he was exposed and is now isolated in the basement of his home. People with monkeypox are believed to be contagious for at least four weeks.\n\nHe's taking an antiviral medication called TPOXX, which is being made available to monkeypox patients.\n\nDoctors were able to vaccinate the patient's wife, and they're carefully watching his children, including the baby, whom he held before he knew he was contagious.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPublic health officials have recently expanded access to the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine to children under certain circumstances.\n\nGriffin says that although the vaccine should be safe, there's no data on its use in kids. TPOXX is also recommended for children under the age of 8, a group the CDC says is at higher risk for severe outcomes from the virus.\n\nFor now, the man is stuck in his basement and unable to help at home, which Griffin said has been tough for him and his family.\n\n\"The dad, who is really important in the first few weeks of baby's life, is now locked in the basement, which is tragic,\" Griffin said. \"You don't get those weeks back.\"", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/illinois-day-care-monkeypox/index.html", "title": "Illinois day-care worker tests positive for monkeypox, officials say ...", "text": "(CNN) An Illinois day-care worker has tested positive for monkeypox, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced Friday, but no other cases have been reported there.\n\n\"An adult at a day-care center in the Rantoul area has tested positive for a case of monkeypox,\" department Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said at a news briefing. \"Screening of children and other staff is taking place now.\"\n\nOfficials did not say how many children might have been exposed to the virus.

Vaccinating a patient's close circle of contacts is like vaccinating a \"ring\" around them.\n\nThis approach has been used in response to sexually transmitted infections and prior monkeypox outbreaks.\n\n\"We can have a really effective strategy of containment and elimination by identifying all the cases and then providing the cases with treatment and the close contacts of those cases with post-exposure prophylaxis,\" said a federal health adviser who requested anonymity because they're not a government employee and don't speak for any federal agency.\n\n\"We know that this works,\" the adviser said. \"We have data from other outbreaks to say that it is effective. And so in the beginning, when cases were low -- in the tens, the dozens of cases -- we were able to effectively work with jurisdictions to identify those cases and, through consultation, figure out how many doses of vaccines would they need to vaccinate as many contacts as they think existed.\"\n\nBut toward late June, the monkeypox outbreak had spread.\n\nThe CDC's initial strategy \"was just doomed to failure,\" Murphy said, referencing how a \"ring\" strategy requires swift and robust outreach to all known contacts of a monkeypox patient -- which was becoming increasingly difficult to do as cases were growing, and in more places.\n\n\"A ring vaccination strategy was never going to work, frankly,\" Murphy said. \"I mean, look how fast this virus has spread.\"\n\nFederal health officials expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that makes up most US monkeypox cases.\n\n\"We recognized that a traditional post-exposure prophylaxis strategy was no longer the best strategy for that current moment of the outbreak -- and so we shifted, along with the nation,\" the federal health adviser said.\n\nBut the CDC estimates 1.5 million people are eligible for the two-dose vaccine. After initial orders for 72,000 vaccines , 300,000 additional doses were made available. Another nearly 800,000 doses were OK'd this week , and will be available in the coming weeks.But the CDC estimates 1.5 million people are eligible for the two-dose vaccine.\n\nThe CDC's strategy still directs shots toward people who might have had a monkeypox exposure -- not preventing cases among those who might be exposed in the future.\n\nAs of Friday, the US has tallied nearly 5,200 confirmed or probable monkeypox cases. With limited supply and growing awareness of the virus and its painful effects, vaccination appointments are still going fast.\n\nLimitations of the ring strategy\n\nEven though the US response to the monkeypox outbreak has evolved, there are clear reasons why federal health officials would immediately consider a ring vaccination strategy early on.\n\n\"That's the way that we eradicated smallpox from the planet, and it was the way that prior monkeypox outbreaks have been controlled,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nBut Adalja and many other public health experts argue that a broader vaccination response against monkeypox should have been implemented from the beginning, as the ring strategy comes with a limitation: It hinges on robust contact tracing.\n\n\"Because of the unique characteristics of this outbreak -- the fact that it's spreading mostly amongst men who have sex with men and has been kind of exploiting anonymous sex parties, raves and the like -- it became quickly clear that contact tracing was going to miss a lot of contacts, especially if individual case patients didn't even know the names of their contacts,\" Adalja said.\n\n\"It's not that we don't have the contact tracers. It's that the individuals don't know their contacts,\" he said. \"The contact trace data was not complete enough to be able to rely solely on ring vaccination.\"\n\nFor ring vaccination to work, \"there has to be enough vaccine, those in the ring need to be identified and vaccinated, and this has to be done quickly,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC director and president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n\"Because many contacts of cases were from anonymous encounters, this makes ring vaccination much more challenging,\" he wrote. \"And because monkeypox is spread by intimate contact, identifying those who were close to the patients is much harder than for smallpox, both because of the sensitivity of this information, and because some of the contacts may have been anonymous.\"\n\nCDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told CNN that \"ring vaccination can only be effective if all contacts of a case are identified and vaccinated.\"\n\n\"As the outbreak went on, it became clear that some of the cases were having anonymous close encounters, which fueled transmission. CDC then expanded our vaccination strategy,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nThe federal health adviser said this is not unique to monkeypox.\n\n\"Ring vaccination requires identification of cases and identification of contacts, and that is challenging no matter what disease it is. It's challenging for Covid; it's challenging for HIV; it's challenging for syphilis,\" the adviser said. \"And so just because it's challenging doesn't mean we didn't want to pursue this strategy.\"\n\n'We went against CDC'\n\nSome local health officials saw the writing on the wall early in the outbreak and never implemented a ring vaccination of just close contacts. Instead, vaccines have been offered to a broader group of higher-risk people from the beginning.\n\nIn the nation's capital, the DC Department of Health has been closely tracking the spread of monkeypox virus since the spring, watching anxiously as cases emerged in regions of the world where the virus typically is not seen.\n\nJUST WATCHED Monkeypox: Dr. Gupta explains how it spreads and what the symptoms are Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Monkeypox: Dr. Gupta explains how it spreads and what the symptoms are 04:16\n\nWhen the first US case was reported in Massachusetts, DC health officials organized a team that was trained in identifying monkeypox and how it spreads. Around that time, the city also ordered vaccines.\n\n\"I was one of the first to order vaccines from CDC, before we had a case,\" said Anil Mangla, state epidemiologist for the DC Department of Health. The first potential monkeypox case in DC was reported in early June.\n\nAfter DC's vaccine order arrived, shots were offered in late June in two rings. Ring one included the close contacts of cases identified by the epidemiology team. Ring two included any adult resident who was gay or bisexual with multiple anonymous partners in the previous two weeks or who was a transgender woman or nonbinary who has sex with men or sex workers or staff at establishments where sexual activity occurs.\n\nAmong the close contacts, \"we actually have vaccinated 246 people in that first ring,\" Mangla said Wednesday. \"When I broaden that net, we have vaccinated -- as of last night -- 6,628.\"\n\nHe added that if DC just focused on vaccinating the close contacts in ring one, those thousands of people who voluntarily got immunized in ring two would have received the vaccine much later during the outbreak.\n\n\"We went against CDC,\" Mangla said of the district's broad two-ring vaccination approach, adding that the CDC is now working on projects with the DC Department of Health to better understand this outbreak response model.\n\nHowever, the monkeypox vaccine supply has not met the growing demand in DC -- or in most regions across the country.\n\n\"It's very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN this week . \"What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure, but go well beyond that.\"\n\nThe public health community \"is recognizing the tension between our desires and limited supply,\" the federal health adviser said.\n\nWith limited supply, cities prioritize first doses\n\nOn Monday, the DC Department of Health announced that due to the \"very limited\" supply of vaccines, only first doses will be provided to high-risk residents, even though Jynneos is a two-dose vaccine. Second doses will be provided at a later time.\n\n\"This decision is based on the available scientific evidence, the acceleration of the outbreak, the demand for vaccine from the high number of eligible people, and extreme shortages of the JYNNEOS Monkeypox vaccine nationally,\" the announcement said. \"DC Health is confident that additional vaccine doses will be available when needed for those who have received their first dose.\"\n\nIn New York City, which also expanded eligibility for the monkeypox vaccine to any adult in a high-risk group, first doses have been prioritized.\n\n\"New York City is the epicenter of the monkeypox outbreak in the U.S. and yet does not have sufficient vaccine supply,\" the city announced in mid-July . \"Given the rapid increase in cases, the Health Department has decided that providing first doses to offer protection to more at-risk New Yorkers is the best strategy until we receive adequate vaccine supply. This single dose strategy is consistent with the monkeypox vaccine distribution strategy taken in the UK and Canada.\"\n\nChicago also is prioritizing first doses of vaccine.\n\nThe city announced that it is prioritizing doses for all known close contacts of monkeypox cases as part of a ring strategy , while offering vaccine to those who are gay, bisexual or trans men who have sex men and have had sexual contact with multiple partners, in a social or sexual venue or by giving or receiving money in exchange for sex.\n\nThese vaccines are being offered through doctors' offices and clinics as well as pop-up events at venues, such as bathhouses and Pride events, according to the city's announcement.\n\n\"The goal is address equity along with maximizing doses administered,\" Massimo Pacilli, the Chicago Public Health Department's deputy commissioner of disease control, wrote in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, in a state that does not have many monkeypox cases or vaccines, the Connecticut Department of Public Health announced Thursday that it will launch a program to administer doses of vaccine starting Monday to any adult resident who is gay, bisexual, a man who has sex with men, transgender, gender nonconforming, or gender nonbinary and has had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the past 14 days. Connecticut has 28 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases.\n\n\"This is a national model that has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and it is consistent with our neighboring jurisdictions,\" Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani said. \"DPH is partnering with 15 community-based clinics to expand the availability and efficient delivery of the vaccine to those who need it the most.\"\n\nA 'rapidly closing' window\n\nStill, questions remain around where the nation's fight against monkeypox is heading.\n\n\"It's not clear that monkeypox can be contained at this point, but it's certainly worth trying,\" said Frieden, the former CDC director.\n\nFederal health officials remain optimistic that the nation can end the outbreak.\n\n\"To the question, can we not only stay ahead of this virus but end this outbreak? Absolutely,\" Becerra said Thursday.\n\n\"We believe that we have done everything we can at the federal level to work with our state and local partners and communities affected to make sure we can stay ahead of this and end this outbreak, but everybody's got to take the oar and row. Everybody's got to do their part.\"\n\nLawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said \"the window for containing monkeypox is rapidly closing.\"\n\n\"I do think it's still possible to contain, but it's also equally possible that this may become endemic in the United States,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTo contain the monkeypox virus, Gostin called for the United States to declare a national public health emergency, raise awareness about the virus in non-stigmatizing ways and, of course, make more vaccine doses available.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern last week. On the national level, HHS has yet to make such a determination.\n\n\"We continue to monitor the response throughout the country on monkeypox,\" Becerra said Thursday. \"We will weigh the decision on declaring a public health emergency based on the response we're seeing throughout the country.\"", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/monkeypox-vaccine-demand/index.html", "title": "Demand for monkeypox vaccine rises with case counts, but supply ...", "text": "(CNN) The number of monkeypox vaccine doses distributed across the United States has more than tripled since last week, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, but supply falls far short of demand -- and short of the levels that experts say will be needed to control the outbreak.\n\nMichael Austin Nicolo, a bartender in New York City, is one of more than a thousand people in the US who have been diagnosed with the virus this year. He's also one of many more who have struggled to find an available vaccine.\n\n\"I just first heard about monkeypox like everybody else, through the news, social media, the grapevine, and how it was becoming something we need to be worried about and how it was predominantly affecting gay men or men who have sex with men,\" Nicolo said.\n\nIt was enough to send him in search of more information on how to protect himself.\n\n\"At the time, there was little resources on finding the vaccine,\" he said.\n\n\"I had two friends reach out with links, and we clicked on them, and they are already completely like -- they were gone immediately. There was no access to anything,\" he said.\n\n\"We just kind of kept an eye on the links and kept on living our lives. And then after Pride weekend is when I started to show symptoms of it -- and that was too late.\"\n\nWhere vaccines are going\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1.5 million men who have sex with men are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine. Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact and in this outbreak, has mostly been spreading among men who have sex with men.\n\nMore than 132,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine -- a two-dose regimen manufactured by Bavarian Nordic -- have been pulled from the national strategic stockpile and distributed nationwide, according to HHS data , but it hasn't been enough to meet demand.\n\n\"We got an allotment of 200 vaccines, and the appointments for that went in about an hour and a half,\" said Dr. David Holland, chief clinical officer of the Fulton County, Georgia, Board of Health.\n\nThe CDC says decisions about how to allocate the limited vaccine supply are based equally on the number of cases and the population at risk in a specific area.\n\nThe Jynneos vaccine is available now for people at high risk of exposure: those who have been identified as close contacts of someone who has been diagnosed with monkeypox, those who have had sex with a partner diagnosed with monkeypox within the past 14 days, and those who have had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area with monkeypox spread, according to the CDC.\n\nAs more vaccines become available, the agency will continue to evaluate the distribution strategy, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe District of Columbia has received the most vaccines per capita, by far, and the city has many more confirmed cases per capita than any state.\n\nBut as of Wednesday, two states with confirmed cases -- New Mexico and South Dakota -- have yet to receive any doses.\n\nAfter DC, New York has received the most vaccine doses per capita: more than three times the US average. About three-quarters of the state's supply went to New York City.\n\nIn a letter on Tuesday, New York Mayor Eric Adams urged the Biden administration to increase the vaccine allocation, calling his city an \"epicenter\" of the virus in the US.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Wednesday that additional monkeypox vaccine doses will be arriving within weeks from a plant in Denmark.\n\n\"The issue is, we need to get more vaccines out there,\" he said.\n\n\"We are incredibly focused on making sure that vaccine doses get to the United States and get out to places like New York City. Do we wish we had more doses? Of course. We had a stockpile, and what we need is more. We are getting more.\"\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine, says \"the problem is, we simply don't have enough vaccine. So we're trying to play catch-up.\"\n\nThere are also other issues to be considered, he said.\n\n\"I think the challenge is that we need to make sure that the vaccine doesn't go just to the people that are savvy and can get it quickly. We don't want the vaccine only to go to white wealthy individuals.\"\n\nCould a single-dose strategy be helpful?\n\nA full course of the Jynneos vaccine, as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, requires two doses given four weeks apart. But some experts say that one dose might be enough for now -- and that delaying second doses might be a way to address the discrepancy between supply and demand.\n\nIn his letter, Adams called for the administration to \"consider alternative vaccine schedules, utilizing a longer interval between the first and second dose, that would allow more of the immediately available vaccine to be used for first doses.\"\n\nBavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin told Science in early July that \"There are a lot of data to support a single shot.\"\n\nChaplin said the second dose could be given two years later and still achieve the same immune response as the standard schedule, so countries have a long time to provide second shots if they decide to use single shots for now.\n\nHealth experts say providers are not expected to hold back doses right now.\n\n\"From what we've been told, it's: Give the doses you have, and in your later allocations, there'll be additional doses that will cover second doses,\" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.\n\nNot a sustainable strategy\n\nIf the virus isn't contained as soon as possible, health officials fear, it could spread beyond the population groups that are now at high risk.\n\nJanet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, says the US must get past a vaccine strategy focused on high-risk post-exposure because \"there is no vaccine-preventable disease that exists that can be controlled solely post-exposure when there is no prior immunity.\"\n\nMonkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, but it is essentially a new disease to the US, and there is no immunity built up in the population.\n\n\"Everyone is susceptible at this point in time,\" Hamilton said. \"There's no way we will ever be able to control this disease in a completely susceptible population without a pre-exposure vaccine strategy.\"\n\nA need for more and easier testing\n\nIn the meantime, people affected by the virus say they need other resources, as well. The Biden administration has moved to expand testing, with the CDC announcing a collaboration with five private companies to double the nation's testing capacity. Some of those companies have already begun offering testing. But that didn't happen soon enough for some.\n\nNicolo said that when he first went to his doctor with monkeypox symptoms, they took a sample to test -- but he learned days later that it had been discarded, untested.\n\nTwo days after that visit, his symptoms worsened, and he returned to the doctor. The second sample tested positive.\n\nChristian Redondo, a graduate student in Atlanta, noticed a sore and called his local board of health, which said it wasn't doing testing and referred him to his primary care doctor.\n\nHis primary care doctor told him to go to the emergency room to get tested, but Redondo was able to contact a friend at his county health department who said yes, in fact, he would need to go there for a test.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Then, I was in the waiting room for, I don't know, something like four or five hours. It was a very long time. And when I was asking them about it, they said they had to wait for permission from the CDC to even test me for monkeypox,\" he said.\n\nTesting is necessary to prevent further cases and learn more about the full scope of the outbreak.\n\n\"I think one of the challenges that we have is that we're simply not doing enough testing, so there probably are much more cases than we actually are currently registering,\" Emory's del Rio said.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/health/monkeypox-lgbtq-slow-response/index.html", "title": "Frustration builds in LGBTQ community over government response ...", "text": "(CNN) When Samuel Garrett-Pate went to get a monkeypox vaccine a couple of weeks ago, it took hours in line, filling out paperwork, running home to get more paperwork and standing in line again at the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. In total, he says, it took him five hours to get a shot.\n\nAnd Garrett-Pate is one of the lucky ones.\n\nHis partner works an hourly job, so when his doctor recommended that he get the vaccine, he had to go on his lunch hour. After two hours in line, he gave up and went back to work. He had to start the process over again another day in order to get vaccinated.\n\nIt's a scene playing out in public health departments and clinics across the country as the monkeypox outbreak spreads.\n\n\"State and local public health agencies are doing their best with the resources they have, but the federal government has not done enough and are often not acting fast enough to protect the LGBTQ community,\" Garrett-Pate said.\n\n\"There has not been an aggressive response from the federal government and, unfortunately, even from the White House, a White House that should be leading right now,\" he said. \"This is not about pointing fingers. But at the end of the day, the buck stops somewhere. And we don't have the resources that we need to protect the community.\"\n\nGarrett-Pate is the managing director of external affairs for Equality California, an LGBTQ+ civil rights group. It and three other organizations sent a letter last week to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to demand better vaccine access, testing, treatment and, in general, better plans to mitigate the disproportionate impact that the monkeypox outbreak has had on the LGBTQ community.\n\nVaccines are free when people can find them, testing costs can add up, and treatments are still difficult to access.\n\nAccess has been a struggle since the monkeypox outbreak reached the US two months ago. The CDC estimates that about 1.5 million people are eligible for the two-dose vaccine, but as of Thursday, the US Department of Health and Human Services said that 338,000 doses have been delivered.\n\nThe San Francisco Department of Public Health told CNN that it requested 35,000 doses of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine to meet the needs of the community. As of Thursday, it has received only about 12,000 doses -- less than half of what it requested from the federal government.\n\nOne of the major public clinics offering the vaccine there had to shut down Tuesday when it ran out after vaccinating 600 people.\n\nGeorgia's Department of Public Health said it has given out all 13,876 of the vaccines it received so far. Its next allocation of 34,120 will be available over the next four to six weeks. There is more demand than vaccines.\n\n\"As soon as we open up appointment slots, they are taken up within a very short mount of time -- minutes,\" the department's director of communications, Nancy Nydam, said in an email.\n\nAs of Friday, New York City's public health department website says all available appointments for vaccines have been filled at this time.\n\nThe federal government says it is working to get more vaccines distributed. HHS announced that ordering could begin this week on 786,000 additional monkeypox vaccines. The agency anticipates making about 1.9 million doses available in 2022, with an additional 2.2 million doses available in the first half of 2023.\n\nPublic health response so far\n\nAs of Friday, the United States has than 5,000 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases, according to CDC data.\n\nMonkeypox can infect anyone. But the majority of cases in this outbreak have been among men who have sex with men, including people who identify as gay, bi and transgender, according to the CDC. However, the agency says it has detailed information on only about half of the cases, and that doesn't include information on who's been vaccinated. It doesn't have the authority to collect that data yet.\n\nSince the start of June, the CDC says, it has been doing extensive education and outreach to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe agency has worked with the umbrella organization for local Pride committees to raise awareness. It released educational videos , engaged with groups that work with health disparities and industries whose workers may be exposed to monkeypox, and created awareness campaigns on Instagram and on dating apps popular with the gay community like Scruff, Adam4Adam and Grindr. The agency is also planning to participate in listening sessions with LGBTQ community groups.\n\n\"We appreciate the LGBTQ+ community and their medical and community service providers for helping us in our efforts to raise the visibility of the current situation and of the steps people take to protect their health and the health of others,\" CDC spokesperson Kristen Norlund said in an email Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, the New York State Department of Health declared monkeypox an imminent threat to public health and San Francisco declared monkeypox a local public health emergency\n\n\"We have always been on the forefront of advocacy and action for LGBTQ+ health and I'm issuing this declaration to reaffirm our commitment to the wellbeing of these communities and to allow us to move more quickly to obtain and distribute the resources needed to help those disproportionately impacted,\" said Dr. Susan Philip , the San Francisco public health officer.\n\nThe US has not made such an emergency declaration , which would provide more money and staff, help with data collection and help cut through red tape to better fight the outbreak.\n\nEchoes of previous crises\n\nGarrett-Pate and other leaders in the community see the federal response as a familiar pattern of neglect of the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"We faced outbreaks that have turned into crises that have turned into epidemics and pandemics that disproportionately impact our community in the past, and unfortunately, in the past, public health entities starting with the CDC and FDA have not moved quickly enough or afforded these outbreaks and public health crises the urgency that they demand.\"\n\n\n\nGarrett-Pate likens the monkeypox outbreak to the AIDS epidemic, when the Reagan administration dragged its feet and, historians say, showed outright disdain for the LGBTQ community.\n\nBy 1989, the US had lost nearly 90,000 people -- mostly gay, bi and trans men -- to AIDS, but \"the Reagan administration had all but turned its back on the AIDS epidemic, costing precious time and lives,\" according to one commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe Biden administration is no Reagan administration, Garrett-Pate said, and monkeypox is not AIDS. But he believes that even more recently, with Covid-19, the government failed to do enough for the community.\n\nThe CDC found that members of the LGBTQ community were likely more vulnerable to getting Covid-19 and were potentially more susceptible to severe illness. But sexual orientation and gender identity information is still not consistently captured by standard Covid-19 data collection systems.\n\n\"We saw how the pandemic disproportionately impacted the LGBTQ community, and yet we still don't have the data collection that is needed to fully understand why that was and to what degree it was disproportionately impacting LGBTQ people,\" Garrett-Pate said.\n\n\"The Biden administration has absolutely been supportive of our community. But at the end of the day, we need vaccines, and we need them yesterday. There's no reason it should be taking this long.\"\n\nPeople who work with the federal government say they are working hard on the issue.\n\n\"We have been very transparent about a limited supply and have, at every turn, really tried to overdeliver on our promises to make sure that we had vaccine sooner than we said we might have it, that we would have more to provide than we said we might have, that we could get it out to more jurisdiction than we said we might be able to do and have tried our best to really over deliver for the American people,\" said a federal health adviser who requested anonymity because they're not a government employee and they don't speak for any federal agency.\n\nSean Cahill, director of health policy research at the Fenway Institute in Boston, a health organization that works with sexual and gender minorities that has treated patients with monkeypox, said that what the federal government has done is not enough.\n\n\"They've not overdelivered. Not even close. They've underdelivered. Honestly, we went from one person diagnosed with monkeypox in mid-May to nearly 5,000 people today. The US government has not done a good job controlling this,\" Cahill said. \"They've not done a good job getting vaccines into people's arms. They mismanaged testing in the early weeks, although the CDC has done better recently. Getting treatments is still too complicated.\"\n\nCahill said his organization has been advocating for the US to declare monkeypox a public health emergency.\n\n\"We really would have liked them to have a sense of urgency about this,\" he added. \"Community members have a huge sense of urgency. They're trying to protect themselves. They're trying to get vaccinated, and we need public health agencies to step up and to deliver more than they have up until now.\n\nSome state and local officials have tried to lend their support.\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents the San Francisco area, submitted a budget letter last week in which he asked for an emergency budget appropriation to support expanded testing, vaccinations and education. San Francisco has a strong health infrastructure, he said, and a LGBTQ community that's receptive to efforts to take care of their health.\n\n\"But even here, it's hard,\" Wiener said. \"Our community gets ignored. Our health is always devalued by society at large, and it's happening again.\"\n\nWiener said he faults the \"very, very, very sluggish response by the federal government.\"\n\nFaster action may have kept outbreak in check\n\nThe lack of access is also frustrating for Christopher Vasquez , communications director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. His organization was one of the signers of the letter to the CDC demanding a bigger response.\n\n\"We've known about monkeypox for 50 years. And we've had a vaccine for multiple years. This has been so abysmally handled, and we're seeing upticks in cases because we didn't get it under control when we had the greatest chance to do so,\" he said.\n\nEverywhere he goes in the community, he said, people are talking about monkeypox. They're scared and don't know how they can realistically keep themselves safe with a lack of vaccines.\n\n\"If this were something like Covid that was affecting the entire population, we would have seen a much more robust response from the government,\" Vasquez said. \"I'm not claiming the Biden administration has any animus to the LGBTQ community. I just think because we're a limited community, they didn't put the full weight and resources of the federal government behind stopping this early.\"\n\nThe federal health adviser said it's understandable that some in the LGBTQ community are frustrated and feel left behind.\n\n\"I can totally understand the frustration,\" the adviser said. \"I think, in some ways, we should expect that, and we should welcome that, because they're representing people who are suffering from a disease that is quite painful and it's causing really significant disease. That said, I think that what we have tried to do is, again, over-deliver in our promises to the community, and at times, we find that the community doesn't necessarily recognize the achievements that we have and moves directly on to an additional criticism.\"\n\nSome experts though have said it's now too late to stop what we had the tools to stop earlier.\n\n\"This is another example of failure of not only the US but global public health policy toward emerging infectious diseases. They are late to the party,\" said Dr. Robert Murphy , executive director of the Harvey Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Sadly, it's the same old story: unable to quickly diagnose, unable to vaccinate high risk persons, unable to rapidly treat those at highest risk. The situation is even more frustrating because unlike what happened with Covid-19 there's already existing technology to diagnose, treat, vaccinate to prevent monkeypox.\"\n\nVasquez said that after two-plus years of managing the pandemic, he thought the country would have learned how to better protect public health.\n\n\"I think a lot of people within the community that monkeypox is affecting really feel left behind,\" he said. \"Once again, it's been left on the shoulders of gay and bi men, MSM and trans folk to spread the word by mouth.

Two biotechnology companies, Roche and Abbott, have announced plans to roll out monkeypox PCR tests, although right now, their test kits are for research only.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it's exploring ways to get monkeypox-specific testing out to states.\n\nThere are already 74 labs across 46 states -- part of a network known as the Laboratory Response Network -- that are \"using an FDA-cleared test for orthopoxviruses,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Thursday.\n\nCurrent capacity is around 7,000 of these tests weekly, with the potential to expand if needed.\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said a lot of that capacity \"was set up in response to the threat of biological weapons, and smallpox is the most worrisome orthopoxvirus.\"\n\nThe testing that CDC does is more specific to the monkeypox virus, and the agency can genetically sequence samples, as well. For example, it was by looking at the viral genetic code of the first US patient -- a man in Massachusetts who had recently traveled to Canada -- that researchers were able to see that his case of monkeypox closely matched that of a case in Portugal.\n\nHowever, Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a veterinarian and deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, underscored that the testing that goes on at CDC isn't really necessary for patient care.\n\n\"The orthopox test that's in place is an actionable test,\" she said.\n\nExperts say that action may include isolating patients, making treatments and vaccines available, and contact tracing to determine who else might have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBecause other orthopoxviruses aren't spreading in countries where they aren't endemic like the US, one can assume that a positive orthopox test here is indeed monkeypox, according to Adalja.\n\nCountries like Spain have shifted to include orthopox-positive cases as confirmed monkeypox cases in their counts. The CDC's tracker of US cases lists \"total confirmed monkeypox/orthopoxvirus cases.\"\n\n\"I think that more diagnostic tests closer to patients is better. Commercial assays are even better,\" Adalja said. \"But the fact is, there are no other orthopoxviruses out there right now.\"\n\nHe doesn't believe that a lack of monkeypox-specific testing is hindering the public health response \"because an orthopox-positive [case] is going to be monkeypox until proven otherwise in this scenario that we're in right now.\"\n\nHe added that this is a very different situation from the Covid-19 testing stumbles of 2020, when the world was dealing with a novel coronavirus without a major testing alternative, meaning it was often difficult to tell Covid-19 apart from other respiratory viruses like the flu. Monkeypox, on the other hand, we've known about for decades, and there's a plan in place.\n\n\"It's not the same as Covid,\" Adalja said.\n\nIdentifying monkeypox\n\nMonkeypox is rare outside endemic countries, and it isn't as transmissible as a virus like Covid-19, according to the CDC . Humans may be infected by animals, but people can also infect each other through skin-to-skin contact; large respiratory droplets, which tend to travel no more than a few feet; or contact with things contaminated by skin lesions, such as bedding.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic of the disease is a rash that results in lesions or pustules. This can happen anywhere on the body, often on places like the face, hands and feet. In the current outbreak, some cases have caused lesions in the genital or groin area, according to health officials.\n\nThe process for identifying a monkeypox case in the United States begins with a person noticing possible symptoms and seeking medical care. Their provider can contact a local or state health department to collect a specimen for orthopox testing, said Chris Mangal, director of public health preparedness and response at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nAt this time, the CDC is recommending the collection of two specimens -- swabs of lesions.\n\n\"When they run that test, and if that test comes back positive, they will report presumptive positive for non-variola orthopoxvirus. And that presumptive positive is actually good enough -- that, combined with what you're seeing in terms of the patient presentation -- to give them a sense that 'we should take public health actions here,' \" Mangal said.\n\nThe second specimen and the test result are sent to the CDC for its own testing.\n\n\"The CDC and the public health labs actually work closely, hand-in-hand, on this testing,\" Mangal said.\n\nDuring the monkeypox outbreak, the process for confirmatory testing has been \"good enough for the phase we're in right now\" because there has not been a high number of cases, she said.\n\n\"If we get into the scenario where we're seeing a significantly higher number of cases of monkeypox, it is my belief that CDC will then work with the [US Food and Drug Administration] and the public health labs to ensure they have this confirmatory capability,\" she said, adding that there are a few scenarios that could play out if that happens.\n\n\"We can have public health labs developing their own lab-developed tests,\" Mangal said. \"If this rose to an emergency scenario, similar to Covid, laboratories could work through the FDA to obtain an emergency use authorization for confirmatory tests.\"\n\nBut overall, Mangal said, she does not see the current outbreak developing into a major emergency. For the general public, \"it's my opinion that they should not be overly concerned,\" she said.\n\nThe current capacity for monkeypox testing is \"not a major public health concern\" in general, Adalja said, but there is still room for it to move faster or be more widely available.\n\n\"It would be great if Quest and LabCorp could do it. It'd be great if there were kits that people could put in sexually transmitted infection clinics to definitively diagnose,\" he said. \"But I don't think right now you're hampering the public health response, just because there's no other orthopoxvirus circulating.\"\n\nEven if the CDC shifts monkeypox-specific testing to state public health labs, getting confirmatory results could take time, Adalja added.\n\n\"Even though we're talking about state public health labs and members of the CDC's Laboratory Response Network being able to do orthodox PCR, it's still a step -- it still involves paperwork, it still involves making phone calls, that dissuades people from doing it, that has a lag built into it,\" Adalja said.\n\n\"If you work in an STD clinic in some city and you have that kit there, or you have a lab that's right in your town that does it, that makes it so much easier,\" he said.\n\nPlans for monkeypox PCR tests\n\nRoche and Abbott's planned monkeypox PCR tests are separate from the CDC's plans.\n\nNone has received a green light from the FDA, and both companies said last week that their tests are intended for \"research use\" -- though they are leaving the door open to tackle future testing needs.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEven if it doesn't become necessary to expand testing in countries like the US, these moves could benefit other countries, including those in Western and Central Africa where the monkeypox virus has long been endemic.\n\n\"Some of the resource-poor countries where these diseases are endemic sometimes have a clearer path to getting these tests in people's hands than in the United States, where there's so much regulation and it's so hard to do a point-of-care test,\" Adalja said.\n\n\"I do think there's an advantage to having these tests in endemic countries so that people can get diagnoses quickly,\" he added. \"You can find outbreaks much faster.

Orthopox refers to pox viruses in general.\n\n\"It is likely that there are going to be additional cases reported in the United States,\" said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a veterinarian and deputy director of the CDC's Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.\n\nBrooks said the CDC decided to hold a news conference about the outbreak now because LGBTQ Pride month usually kicks off around the Memorial Day weekend, and officials wanted to make sure the community was aware of the situation. He also urged doctors to be on the lookout for the disease, because it can look like other types of STDs.\n\n\"In some cases, during the early stages of illness, the rash has been mostly in the genital and perianal area,\" Brooks said. \"In some cases, it has produced anal or genital lesions that look like other diseases like herpes or chickenpox or syphilis.\n\n\"What we're trying to do by bringing attention to the fact that some of these cases have had a genital and perianal presentation is just to remind people that people may come in for an evaluation of what they think is an STD, but we'd like the provider to think 'could it be monkeypox as well?' if the circumstances fit the story,\" Brooks added.\n\nMonkeypox is an extremely rare viral disease that is similar to smallpox, but it is considered clinically less severe, according to the World Health Organization. Cases usually happen in West and Central Africa. But several people have been diagnosed with monkeypox recently in areas that don't typically see the disease, including in Canada, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the US.\n\nMonkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, but it can spread through intimate contact during sex when someone has an active rash.\n\nIt also can spread through large respiratory droplets, but because large droplets don't travel far in the air, the contact has to be prolonged for this to happen.\n\nMonkeypox can spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or through contact with contaminated clothes or bedsheets, according to the CDC.\n\n\"Anyone can spread monkeypox [from] contact with body fluid or monkeypox sores or respiratory droplets when close to someone,\" Brooks said.\n\nThe virus typically incubates for seven to 14 days before symptoms appear, according to the CDC\n\nInitial symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, headache, fever, muscle aches and fatigue. The disease then progresses into a rash and lesions that blister and scab over. This can happen all over the body. The illness usually lasts two to four weeks.\n\nA person can be contagious from one day before the rash appears until up to 21 days after symptoms began. Once the scabs fall off, the person is no longer contagious, the CDC says.\n\nThe risk to the general public from this outbreak is low, according to the CDC.\n\n\"I don't think that there's a great risk to the general community from monkeypox right now in the United States. I think that we need to pay close attention to the communities in which this might be circulating so that we can communicate effectively with them and help bring this outbreak under control,\" McQuiston said.\n\nMonkeypox doesn't seem to be spreading so quickly that parties or events needed to be canceled to stop the spread.\n\n\"This is not Covid,\" McQuiston said. \"Respiratory spread is not the predominant worry. It is contact, and intimate contact, in the current outbreak setting and population. And that's really what we want to emphasize.\"\n\nIt's also important that this outbreak not cause stigma toward the LGBTQ community, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. It warned that some reporting and commentary on monkeypox has used language and imagery that reinforce stereotypes and exacerbate stigma.\n\ncommunity for having led the way on raising awareness -- and we reiterate that this disease can affect anyone,\" UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director Matthew Kavanagh said in a \"Experience shows that stigmatizing rhetoric can quickly disable evidence-based response by stoking cycles of fear, driving people away from health services, impeding efforts to identify cases, and encouraging ineffective, punitive measures. We appreciate the LGBTIcommunity for having led the way on raising awareness -- and we reiterate that this disease can affect anyone,\" UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director Matthew Kavanagh said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe WHO also cautioned people not to use the disease as a way to negatively label any particular community.\n\n\"There's a lot of stigma and discrimination that surrounds many diseases, and I think the key thing we need to look out for is, as WHO, to work with our partners in communities and elsewhere to make sure that the messaging is correct.

(AP) — The record $4.65 billion sale of the Denver Broncos to Walmart heir Rob Walton and his daughter and son-in-law was unanimously approved Tuesday by NFL owners, the expected final step in the transfer from the family of the late Pat Bowlen.\n\nThe vote was taken at a league meeting at a hotel in Minnesota, where Walton, his daughter, Carrie Walton Penner, and her husband, Greg Penner, were introduced by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. With an estimated worth of $60 billion, the 77-year-old Walton — the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton — becomes the wealthiest owner in the league. Rob Walton served as chairman of the retail giant from 1992-2015.\n\n“I’m appreciative to see such a good group coming to own the Broncos. I think it speaks to the direction that the organization is going in,” right tackle Calvin Anderson said after practice in Englewood, Colorado. “Just like the Avs winning the Stanley Cup, it’s a challenge to us to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nThe Walton-Penner group paid the highest price in history for a sports franchise anywhere in the world. The three limited partners are Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, Starbucks board chair Mellody Hobson and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAll three investors are Black, satisfying a goal to bring more racial diversity into ownership groups, front offices and coaching staffs. With more than one-third of the ownership share belonging to either women or minorities, the Broncos will have by far the most diverse group in the NFL.\n\nThe Pat Bowlen Trust ran the franchise after Bowlen stepped back from day-to-day duties in 2014 because of Alzheimer’s disease. He died in 2019, one month before his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Penner said informal discussions with Bowlen regarding a sale took place as far back as about 10 years ago, right before his health began to decline. This was the only sports franchise, Walton said, the family would have considered buying.\n\nBowlen wanted one of his children to take over the team and Brittany Bowlen, now 32, was the trustees' selected successor. Not all of her siblings supported that choice, so the club was put up for sale. Brittany Bowlen stepped down as the team’s vice president of strategy after the Walton-Penner group was awarded the franchise with their winning bid.\n\nOnly one other NFL club has been sold in the past 10 years: the Carolina Panthers from Jerry Richardson to David Tepper for what was then a record $2.2 billion.\n\nThe Broncos are now the first team since the 2008 Miami Dolphins to change primary owners, head coaches and starting quarterbacks in one offseason.\n\n\"When it comes to the ownership, I am so excited to get to know them, to meet them, and move forward. I know there has been an amazing history here, and you can learn a lot from history — the good, the bad, and everything,” new coach Nathaniel Hackett said. “Right now, it is just about putting ourselves in a position to win some football games.”\n\nThe Broncos also have a general manager, George Paton, with one year under his belt.\n\n“George came up with an outstanding coach, I think, in Nathaniel. They’ll have to perform, but we think we’ve got the pieces to really get together and have a great season,” Walton said.\n\nThe first major decision under the Walton group's watch will be a contract extension for new quarterback Russell Wilson, who arrived via trade with the Seattle Seahawks in March. The new deal for the nine-time Pro Bowl pick is expected to be in the range of $260 million and five years.\n\nAnother pressing issue: Empower Field at Mile High. The stadium is only 21 years old, but it lacks the frills and revenue-producing features of new venues such as SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, the homes of the AFC West rival Chargers and Raiders, respectively.\n\n“It would be premature to start talking about a new stadium. I’ll say that Empower Field at Mile High is a world-class facility,” Penner said, praising the club's relationship with the public agency that oversees the venue and noting the lease that doesn't expire until 2031. “We’ll evaluate all of our options and really dig in and try to understand the situation before making a decision.”\n\nBowlen bought the Broncos in 1984 for $78 million.\n\n“It’s a credit to owners that aren’t alive, owners that are alive, and the Commissioner, that we’re able to generate a price increase and have that sort of equity value in what we do,” Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said. “It’s taken a lot of hard work and a lot of risk.”\n\nThe wife of Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, Ann Walton Kroenke, is Rob Walton's cousin.\n\n“They’ll do a wonderful job,” Kroenke said. “Having people that you know you can count on who are forward-looking and are progressive and want to invest in the facilities, the communities they’re in, that’s a big deal.”\n\nJoe Ellis, who served as team president for the past 11 seasons, has stepped down from his role and will serve as an advisor in 2022 at the request of the new owners.\n\n“Pat Bowlen created an incredible legacy at the Broncos, and he leaves big shoes to fill,” Walton Penner said. “We look forward to continuing to build on that legacy.”\n\nThe arrival of the Walton-Penner group gave the NFL a moment to attempt to deflect some attention off two ownership-related black eyes that developed for the league earlier this year — the ongoing workplace culture investigations surrounding Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder and the tampering and tanking case around Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross.\n\n“The integrity of the game’s critically important. I think the findings were very clear on the tampering charges,” Goodell said. “While tanking clearly did not happen here, I think we all have to understand that our words, and our actions have implications for being interpreted.”\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Arnie Stapleton contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/panthers/2018/05/22/nfl-owners-approve-sale-carolina-panthers-david-tepper/633037002/", "title": "NFL owners approve sale of Carolina Panthers to David Tepper", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nATLANTA (AP) — The new owner of the Carolina Panthers is committed to keeping the team in the Carolinas.\n\nAnd Charlotte is his clearly his first choice.\n\nBut David Tepper left a bit of wiggle room on his first day as owner of the team.\n\nThe NFL unanimously approved Tepper's $2.2 billion purchase of the team from Jerry Richardson on Tuesday, leading to immediate questions about the new owner's thoughts on replacing 22-year-old Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.\n\n\"What's the name of the team?

Already familiar to the league as a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, his purchase was quickly approved.\n\nTepper said he plans to formally take over the team in July.\n\nIn the meantime, he reserved judgment on both a new stadium and those who are running the football side of things, most notably general manager Marty Hurney and coach Ron Rivera.\n\n\"I do think they have a great team down there right now,\" Tepper said. \"The biggest thing I can do is have a great appreciation of how stupid I am. Sometimes, it's better to do nothing than to do something.\"\n\nBank of America will be the NFL's seventh-oldest stadium after Los Angeles opens its new facility for the Rams and Chargers, and the Raiders complete their move from Oakland to Las Vegas.\n\nThat has raised the prospect of the Panthers seeking another home if they can't get a new stadium of their own.\n\nTepper touched on the idea of bringing a Major League Soccer team to Charlotte, which could improve the financial viability of a new stadium. The city was passed over in MLS' latest round of expansion.\n\n\"The first thing I care about is winning. The second thing I care about is winning. And the third thing I care about is?\" he said, waiting for the media to give the obvious answer. \"That's on and off the field. That includes charity aspect, community aspect and how you make a community better. So you win a lot of ways, and I don't like losing in any way.\"\n\nRivera said he looks forward to working with the new owner.\n\n\"He has a sense and a feel for football and he has been around it,\" the coach said. \"Eventually I know we will sit down and talk some football and talk about this team.\"\n\nWhile the owners were approving Tepper, the new-look Panthers were holding their first organized workouts some 250 miles away in Charlotte.\n\n\"For a lot of people, I am sure they are ready for some closure and for that transition to start,\" tight end Greg Olsen said. \"I think this transition has been inevitable for a little while since it was announced that the team would be sold.

(AP) — The Denver Broncos now sport the wealthiest owner in the NFL and the league's most diverse ownership group.\n\nFour of the six members of the Walton-Penner ownership group, which was welcomed into the NFL this week, are either women or minorities.\n\nWalmart heir Rob Walton, the oldest child of Walmart co-founder Sam Walton, bought the Broncos along with his daughter, Carrie Walton Penner, and her husband, for $4.65 billion, a global record for a professional sports franchise.\n\nWalton said Wednesday that his son-in-law, Greg Penner, will serve as CEO of the team. Penner said he'll soon hire a team president. Those roles had been held by Joe Ellis, who is staying on this year as an advisor.\n\nPenner said he'll be the point person “but this is an incredible group. We're going to draw on all of them.”\n\nThe ownership group includes limited partners Mellody Hobson, Condoleezza Rice and Lewis Hamilton. Hobson is CEO of Starbucks, Rice is a former U.S. Secretary of State and Hamilton is the winningest Formula One driver in history.\n\nWalton thanked Ellis for his 27 years of service and paid tribute to the late Pat Bowlen. He purchased the team in 1984 for $78 million and died in 2019, a month shy of his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n“Pat Bowlen built a great legacy and a record of winning and championships,” Walton said. “We plan to do everything we can to build on the championship tradition of this great organization. ... Simply put, it's an honor to steward this historic franchise. Our No. 1 priority is putting a winning team on the field to win Super Bowls.”\n\nBefore Walton's group purchased the Broncos, the NFL's wealthiest owner was Carolina’s David Tepper, whom Forbes estimates has a total net worth of $16.7 billion. Walton’s estimated net worth is $60 billion.\n\n“We wanted to add people that brought different perspectives and experiences and certainly we have that here,” Penner said. \"Lewis, being the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time) Formula One driver, Dr. Rice with all of her experience in politics and academics and world affairs, Mellody, as a you know, an incredible businesswoman and her track record there.\n\n“We’re big believers in bringing together different perspectives and experiences and backgrounds and that we think will make us more successful.”\n\nAll but Hamilton, who is still in racing season, gathered at team headquarters a day after NFL owners unanimously approved the sale Tuesday in Minnesota. The Broncos new ownership group met with staff and players before practice, and star safety Justin Simmons said he was proud to see so many faces of color.\n\n“To see some diversity and to see strong, Black women in the ownership group, I mean, what an inspiration for so many people,\" said Simmons, who is biracial. \"There's little girls out here whose dads play on the team and they can look up at the ownership of the Broncos and they can see someone that looks just like them. I think that's really great.\n\n“But I think the biggest thing on top of that is they didn't just do that to do that,” Simmons said. “I mean, these are really powerful, qualified individuals that deserve this, earned this, worked for this. And that to me is inspiring.”\n\nHobson called it “such an honor and a privilege to be an owner of this remarkable organization. ... The moment is humbling and it's historical, and yet, I feel at home.”\n\nHobson said when she was first approached about joining the ownership group, she encouraged Walton to also bring aboard her friend Hamilton.\n\n“Lewis is my chosen little brother,” she said. “As soon as this opportunity came up, I said, ‘You have to have Lewis.’ I met Lewis in his rookie season as an F1 driver. We bonded over time. As many of you know, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and I call him, ‘Sir Little Brother.’\n\n“He has this winning mentality not just on the track but in everything that he does. He cares deeply about people, about our planet and as the first and one (Black F1 driver) in his sport, about diversity, equity and inclusion.”\n\nRice, who grew up in Denver, joked that her late father John Rice Jr., who was a minister, dean of students at Stillman College and big football fan, “has to be thinking, ‘She finally got a really important job.’”\n\nPenner, who said he doesn't anticipate bringing aboard any more limited partners, demurred when asked if John Elway or Peyton Manning would be involved with the team going forward.\n\nThe new owners met with both on the field Wednesday. Elway told The Associated Press earlier this year that he'd like to advise the new owners to help them in their first year.\n\n“We're just going to learn from both of them,\" Penner said. \"I think it's going to be a really good relationship.”\n\nWhile saying he was thrilled that GM George Payton acquired quarterback Russell Wilson this spring, Penner gave no timeline for a contract extension that's expected to be worth about $260 million over five years.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/broncos/2022/08/09/denver-broncos-sale-approved-rob-walton-penner-walmart/10271281002/", "title": "Broncos' sale approved, Rob Walton becomes wealthiest NFL owner", "text": "The Denver Broncos officially have new owners.\n\nThe NFL’s ownership group voted unanimously Tuesday in Minneapolis to approve the sale of the franchise to Walmart heir Robert Walton and his family, the final step in a years-long process for the Patrick D. Bowlen Trust that included litigation, family drama and an auction sale that formally began earlier this year.\n\nWalton, 77, takes over along with his daughter, Carrie Walton-Penner, son-in-law, Greg Penner and a small set of known limited shareholders. The son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, Rob Walton immediately becomes the wealthiest owner in the NFL by nearly a factor of four thanks to his estimated personal net worth of around $60 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nPenner, 52, is Walmart’s chairman and is expected to take a major role in leading the day-to-day operations of the franchise under the title of CEO or something similar. Current Broncos CEO Joe Ellis, who served as a trustee for the Bowlen Trust and helped navigate the sales process, has already announced he plans to step down once the transition is complete, though Penner said Tuesday that Ellis would stay on as an advisor through the 2022 season. Brittany Bowlen, one of late former owner Pat Bowlen's children, also recently confirmed she’s leaving her role as the franchise’s senior vice president of strategic initiatives.\n\nFROM NFL QB TO MUSHROOM FARMER:Jake Plummer's life-altering journey into the queendom of fungi\n\nBRONCOS:Happy-go-lucky Nathaniel Hackett is no typical NFL taskmaster\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe franchise was formally put up for sale on Feb. 1 after years of legal wrangling and fighting for control of the franchise among the late Pat Bowlen’s children and brother. Once the last legal hurdles were cleared, the Bowlen Trust initiated an auction process.\n\nBowlen purchased the team for around $78 million in 1984 and owned it until his death in 2019, though he ceded control of the team to Ellis in 2014 amid his battle with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe Walton-Penner family’s presence in the race immediately made them a perceived favorite given Walton’s immense wealth. The family’s record bid was quickly accepted, with the announcement on a sales agreement being reached coming roughly 24 hours after the franchise’s deadline for second-round bids in June.\n\n\"The Broncos are the one sports franchise that we would have considered buying,\" Walton said during a news conference Tuesday. \"Greg acutely started conversations some 10 years ago about it. When the team actually announced it was for sale early this year, we got in the middle of it first thing.\"\n\nThe NFL’s finance committee reviewed and approved the Walton-Penner family’s bid in late July and the final step came Tuesday with a vote of the league’s full ownership group.\n\nLimited shareholders\n\nSo far, there are three known limited shareholders outside of the Walton-Penner family. They are former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, champion Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton and Ariel Investments co-CEO and Starbucks chairwoman Mellody Hobson.\n\nRice has a long history in football, having served on the College Football Playoff selection committee from 2013-16. She spent much of her childhood in Denver and holds undergraduate and doctoral degrees from Denver University. She crossed over in teaching and working at Stanford with Penner and Walton-Penner.\n\nHamilton is the only Black driver on the F1 circuit currently and has won seven world championships since 2008. He is English but has a home in Colorado that he has told media outlets in the past he spends some of each offseason at.\n\nHobson has a long list of business accomplishments, including becoming the first Black chairwoman of a S&P 500 company.\n\nFour questions going forward\n\nWill the Walton-Penner group build a new stadium?\n\nEmpower Field is going to need several hundred million in renovations in the coming years. Walton is related by marriage to Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who put $5 billion of his own money into building SoFi Stadium in part so he could develop a real estate empire around it and build a 365-days-per-year cash flow machine.\n\nHow quickly might the Broncos’ new ownership group decide whether it wants to renovate or rebuild? And if the answer is rebuild, is that stadium downtown? East of the city? To the Southeast near the current training complex?\n\n\"It's premature to start talking about a new stadium,\" Penner said at the news conference. \"I'll say that Empower Field at Mile High is a world-class facility. ... We've got a good partnership with the Metropolitan Football Stadium District and fortunately have almost 10 years left on our lease, so we'll evaluate all of our options and really dig in and understand the situation before making a decision.\"\n\nMORE:Will Broncos build NFL's next splashy stadium? For owner-to-be Rob Walton, venue issue looms large\n\nWhen will the team extend quarterback Russell Wilson’s contract?\n\nThere isn’t a ton of urgency behind this one because everybody involved believes the only question is indeed “when” rather than “if.”\n\nWilson is under contract through 2023 and has a manageable $24 million salary cap hit this year. Any extension is not likely to happen during the regular season, so a short window will remain open for the next few weeks. Guaranteed money in a contract – and Wilson will get a lot of it, considering the guarantees made recently to Deshaun Watson, Kyler Murray and others – must be put into escrow when a deal is signed. If it doesn’t happen in the next few weeks, then likely next offseason.\n\nMORE:Is Russell Wilson next QB to land massive payday? Deal will come 'at the right time,' Broncos say\n\nHow will the organization be structured?\n\nPenner will be heavily involved and then, after that, not much is known yet about how the family will go about setting up its organizational chart.\n\nWill the limited shareholders have any active role in the day-to-day? What impact can three high-profile Black shareholders have on not only the Broncos, but also the NFL? And what is the size of their stakes in the franchise?\n\nWill there be any additional limited shareholders?\n\nThere are two Hall of Fame quarterbacks whose names get brought up frequently on this topic in Peyton Manning and John Elway.\n\nManning’s situation is particularly interesting because of his expanding media empire at Omaha Productions and his role on the \"ManningCast\" during ESPN’s \"Monday Night Football\" broadcasts. The NFL did not respond to a USA TODAY Sports question about whether Manning could be involved with league broadcast partners and also own a share of the franchise.\n\nWealthiest NFL owners\n\nWalton goes right to the top of the list of the wealthiest NFL owners, which perhaps is not surprising considering Forbes has him ranked as the 20th wealthiest person on the planet.\n\nThe new NFL pecking order, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list:\n\n1. Rob Walton, Denver Broncos, $59.8 billion\n\n2. Dave Tepper, Carolina Panthers, $16.7 billion\n\n3. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys, $11.6 billion\n\n4.

Wilson, who died in March, to Pegula and his wife, Kim.\n\nThe Pegulas also own the NHL's Buffalo Sabres and have said they'll keep the Bills in western New York — ending years, if not decades, of speculation about the team's future in one of the NFL's smallest markets.\n\n\"If you asked me 10 years ago if I was going to own the Sabres and the Bills, I would've called you a liar,\" said Terry Pegula, an oil and gas mega-billionaire who agreed in principle to buy the team Sept. 9.\n\nThe NFL's finance committee already had unanimously approved the sale, and approval from owners was considered a done deal.\n\nIt was the first item on the agenda Wednesday morning at the league's fall gathering of owners, and about 10 minutes after the meeting began, the Pegulas were ushered into the room to a round of applause.\n\nBills CFO Jeffrey C. Littmann told reporters the Wilson trust had been working in a linear fashion to identify successor owners and secure ownership approval.\n\n\"Now the third step is to proceed on the closing, and we think that will be done in a very quick and easy way,\" Littman said.\n\nPegula said he and his wife are \"honored\" to be approved. He answered only a few questions, saying he'd reserve his expanded remarks for Friday in Buffalo once the deal is complete.\n\n\"There's a small matter of having to pay some money,\" Pegula said. \"Wires have to be sent from banks and paperwork has to be signed or whatnot. But we'll get that done.\"\n\nThe vote was no surprise, given that owners roundly expressed support for the Pegulas' purchase after arriving at the Conrad New York hotel Tuesday.\n\n\"They're very committed to Buffalo — we're delighted to approve them,\" Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said Tuesday. \"And I think they'll be great for Buffalo.

The address comes a day after Biden won final approval of his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will discuss \"the many sacrifices that the American people have made over the last year and the grave loss communities and families across the country have suffered.\" Biden is also likely to tout his administration's work in deploying COVID-19 vaccines, which have increased from a weekly average of 900,000 when Biden took office to 2.2 million last week. Biden spoke at a White House event Wednesday with the heads of Johnson & Johnson and Merck, the pharmaceutical company that is partnering with its competitor to help produce the COVID-19 vaccines. The administration has arranged to purchase an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine.\n\nPrefer to listen?

From that alarming announcement, a national tragedy ensued. By the end of March 2020 the U.S. had the most cases of any nation; today, more than 529,000 Americans have died from the COVID-19 virus, with about 1,900 more still dying each day. Apart from the brutal death toll, Americans have had to endure masks and lockdowns, loss of jobs, and the interruption of countless pleasures great and small. The amazingly rapid development of vaccines has renewed hope for a swift end to the nightmare. Even so, experts say it may be many more months before we can truly declare victory over COVID-19.\n\nThe pandemic relief bill has passed. What’s next?\n\nThe House has officially given the green light to the COVID-19 relief package containing $1,400 stimulus checks for millions of Americans. It now heads to President Joe Biden, who is expected to give his final stamp of approval Friday. It's hard to say when the checks will arrive, but the last round of payments arrived via direct deposit about two weeks after the bill was signed. Those who got a paper check had to wait longer. Meanwhile, there are others that stand to benefit from Biden's relief bill, such as schools, restaurants, farmers and event venues.\n\nMinnesota Supreme Court weighs murder charge against Derek Chauvin\n\nThe trial will continue on Thursday of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in a case that rocked the country and spurred worldwide protests after George Floyd's death. The first hour of the day will be dedicated to discussing potential conflicts in the trial. After that, jury selection will continue. On Wednesday, the court, for hours, heard from more potential jurors, with both Chauvin's attorney and prosecutors questioning them about their knowledge of the case, the protests and Floyd's death. Jurors faced questions about whether they could set aside any existing opinions to serve impartially. Thus far, five jurors have been chosen: four men and one woman. Three weeks have been set aside to choose the jury. On Thursday, the judge reinstated a third-degree murder charge, giving the jury more options as it considers Chauvin's culpability in the death of rge Floyd.\n\nMore NBA teams get back to business as all eyes shift to San Antonio\n\nOn the heels of the league's All-Star break, the NBA ramps up its schedule Thursday as 22 teams face off in 11 games. Notable ones include the Boston Celtics traveling to face East powerhouse Brooklyn Nets (TNT, 7:30 p.m. ET), the Los Angeles Clippers hosting the Golden State Warriors (TNT, 10 p.m. ET) and two surprisingly strong teams meeting in Portland as the Trail Blazers (21-14) host the Phoenix Suns (24-11). The league likely thought its ceremonial second half would begin quietly Wednesday as just two games were on the schedule, but the San Antonio Spurs sent shockwaves when they announced seven-time All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge won't play another game for the team this season. \"We've mutually agreed for him to work out some opportunities for him, and that'll be elsewhere,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. The trade deadline is March 25, and if the Spurs can't find a trade partner, the two sides will work on a buyout.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/health/global-covid-deaths-surpass-six-million/index.html", "title": "Global Covid-19 deaths surpass 6 million - CNN", "text": "(CNN) The global Covid-19 death toll surpassed 6 million on Monday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nGlobal daily deaths have been dropping quickly over the past month, down from about 11,000 a day in the second week of February to about 7,000 a day now -- one of the lowest rates reported over the past year.\n\nBut the loss is still immense, with about 1 million deaths recorded over the past four months.\n\nAbout 1 in every 1,300 people globally has died of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, and experts have said official death tolls are likely an undercount.\n\nWorld Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Sunday that it's \"too early to declare victory\" over Covid-19.\n\n\n\n\"Many countries are facing high rates of hospitalization & death.

Hart wears one while working retail sales at the most magical place on Earth, but nowhere else. “It’s against our freedoms,” she says. “And I’m not some religious weirdo who thinks it’s the mark of the beast.”\n\nAfter more than 18 months of a pandemic, with 1 of every 545 Americans killed by COVID-19, a substantial chunk of the population continues to assert their own individual liberties over the common good.\n\nThis great divide – spilling into workplaces, schools, supermarkets and voting booths – has split the nation at a historic juncture when partisan factionalism and social media already are achieving similar ends.\n\nIt is a phenomenon that perplexes sociologists, legal scholars, public health experts and philosophers, causing them to wonder:\n\nAt what point should individual rights yield to the public interest? If coronavirus kills 1 in 100, will that be enough to change some minds? Or 1 in 10?\n\nToday, millions of U.S. residents shun vaccines that have proven highly effective and resist masks that ward off infection, fiercely opposing government restrictions.\n\nOthers clamor for regulation, arguing that those who take no precautions are violating their rights – threatening the freedom to live of everyone they expose.\n\nIn an online dialogue about the friction between liberty and the greater good, Clare Palmer, a philosophy professor at Texas A&M University, agreed that exercising a freedom to go maskless creates “catastrophic threats to the well-being of others.\"\n\n“How much should government constrain citizens’ otherwise rightful activities to lower the risk?” she asked. “We may be entering a period … when countries will need to reassess their willingness to use the law to protect the most vulnerable and to advance the common good.”\n\nNo matter where one stands, it puts a new spin on the famous line delivered at America's founding by Patrick Henry: \"Give me liberty or give me death.\"\n\n‘An act of defiance’\n\nSeldom in the nation’s past has a culture boundary been so clear-cut, or the clash between personal rights and public welfare been so polarized.\n\nCOVID-19 is now killing more than 2,000 Americans each week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with new infections topping 60,000 a day for the first time in more than three months. Nearly two-thirds of the nation’s counties are reeling from substantial or high transmission rates as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a striking paradox has evolved: About 99% of America’s COVID-19 deaths today are people who did not get shots. Yet, the unvaccinated – who are more susceptible to infection and more likely to spread the disease – also appear to be most resistant to wearing masks.\n\nWhile the scientific research is evolving and medical messaging has been muddled, the vaccine has worked beyond expectations – “a huge celebration of effectiveness,” as Johns Hopkins notes – with limited side effects recorded so far.\n\nThat means getting shots saves lives.\n\nIt also means vaccines could prevent the mutation of more virulent coronavirus strains while hastening a return to economic and social normalcy. So, why do so many turn down the shots and shun masks? Is it a social syndrome that puts self-interest above the common good? Is it a stand for principle? Is it something else?\n\nMichael Sandel, a Harvard professor of government who teaches a course on ethics in an age of pandemics, noted in the university’s gazette that mask-wearing has emerged as “a new front in the culture wars.”\n\nWhile covering one’s face is not difficult, mask opponents are driven by another concern: They don’t want government dictating their behavior. Put simply, Sandel said, the resistance is not about public health: “It’s about politics.”\n\n“Even as the pandemic highlights our mutual dependence, it is striking how little solidarity and shared sacrifice it has called forth,” he noted. “The pandemic caught us unprepared – logistically and medically, but also morally. … (It) arrived at just the wrong moment – amid toxic politics, incompetent leadership and fraying social bonds.”\n\n“It’s an act of defiance,” said Steven Tipton, a professor of sociology and religion at Emory University. “‘You can’t make me.’ And I will enact my own freedom even if it kills me and others around me who I love.’”\n\nTipton co-wrote the book “The Good Society,” describing how America’s institutions have fallen from grace. He is among many who trace this viral distrust a half-century back to President Ronald Reagan’s quote: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’”\n\nAs economic inequities mushroomed and social isolation festered, Tipton said, average Americans came to feel betrayed by government, the marketplace and so-called elites. For them, rejecting science and spurning authorities is a statement of moral outrage rather than an act of selfishness. And that sentiment is encouraged in a social media echo chamber that bonds the disconnected.\n\nIn the end, however, COVID-19 has no politics or ethical code. The virus, acting on a principle of proliferation, has killed more than 4.2 million people worldwide – especially now those who didn’t get shots.\n\nThe moral, Tipton suggested: “Being a good citizen is being mutually responsible. If you believe in the gospels, wear your mask.”\n\nMixed messages, lies and confusion\n\nDuring World War II, the Greatest Generation forged unity with common goals. Americans tended victory gardens to overcome food shortages, volunteered for national defense and made personal sacrifices for the good of the country.\n\nToday, in the face of a pandemic that already has killed more U.S. citizens than the Big War, we block one another’s Facebook pages, stage anti-vaccine protests and in some cases attack one another for requiring or wearing masks.\n\nTo be sure, public confusion and discord have been abetted by muddled messages from government and science, compounded by lies and disinformation spewed via social media.\n\nThe miscues are legend:\n\nEarly in the pandemic, President Donald Trump declared a premature victory over COVID-19 as his chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, warned against opening the country too soon. Fauci and the CDC have issued guidance in favor of masks, then against them, and then for them again – in part because the virus itself has morphed.\n\nPresident Joe Biden last week applied a carrot-and-stick approach, urging local authorities to pay $100 to unvaccinated people who get the shots while announcing that federal employees will face strict testing requirements if they are not vaccinated.\n\nBut in the absence of authority or fortitude to impose public health policies, federal leaders have largely deferred to state and local government. The result: a bewildering and inconsistent panoply of policies that vary from one jurisdiction to the next, and may change overnight.\n\n“There’s just been such tremendous inconsistency in communications about this,” said Corey Basch, chair of the public health department at William Paterson University in New Jersey. “I can understand why there are pockets of the population who really don’t want this mandated, and (they) feel distrust.”\n\nA tale of two counties\n\nConsider Los Angeles and Orange counties in California, sibling hotbeds of COVID-19 that form the nation’s largest metro area.\n\nIn May, after the Orange County Board of Supervisors announced plans to offer a digital record for residents who have been vaccinated, hundreds of enraged people – leery of a new vaccine – jammed a meeting and denounced what they mistakenly believed was a mandatory COVID-19 passport system.\n\nJeanine Robbins, 60, of Anaheim, who attended that event, noticed that nearly all the people opposed to vaccination were also maskless. “I think they’re just taking advantage, and they’re putting other people at risk,” Robbins said. “It’s selfishness.\"\n\nBy contrast, Michael Thomas, a 62-year-old accountant in San Clemente, said he doesn’t believe masks work and he won’t be getting shots because “a person’s immune system will either fight off COVID or it won’t.”\n\nAsked whether his decisions endanger others, Thomas shook his head. “It’s a personal right to do what you want,” he said. “A God-given right.”\n\nThomas volunteered that he sees COVID-19 as a “war crime,” adding, “The guy who made it – the people who developed the virus – should be brought to justice.”\n\nAsked who he believes created and spread the disease, Thomas said, “I understand Dr. Fauci was intimately involved …” He would not identify his source for that allegation.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, a picture circulating on right-wing social media sites, which purportedly shows Fauci with then-President Barack Obama at the Wuhan, China, lab in 2015, was actually taken at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., during 2014.\n\nIn conservative Orange County, plans for digital vaccine recordkeeping were canceled, and there are no generalized mask requirements. But late last month, Disneyland reinstated a mask mandate and announced mandatory coronavirus shots for most employees.\n\nCity of the Angels\n\nBarely one month after Gov. Gavin Newsom ended most COVID-19 restrictions in California, declaring that the state was “turning the page on this pandemic,” viral caseloads in Los Angeles County had increased sevenfold.\n\nOn July 16, in a push for public safety, the Board of Supervisors reinstated indoor mask requirements. Sheriff Alex Villanueva promptly announced that his deputies would not enforce the measure because it is “not backed by science.”\n\nIn the shadow of downtown skyscrapers, Steven Nuñez, 35, mulled the question and allowed that public leaders had no choice but to impose mandates. “We’ve already seen what happens when it’s voluntary,” he noted.\n\nNuñez, a minister with the International Buddhist Meditation Center, said his theology calls for a balancing of compassion and wisdom, with action based not on personal interests but the welfare of others. “I don’t wear a mask in public because I’m afraid,” he stressed, “but because doing that might keep someone safe.”\n\n‘Typhoid Mary’\n\nIn the early 1900s, a domestic cook for wealthy families named Mary Mallon unwittingly infected hundreds of people in New York with the Salmonella typhi bacteria before medical investigators identified her as a superspreader.\n\nMallon, nicknamed “Typhoid Mary,” refused to be tested and fled from authorities, only to be captured and quarantined. During two years of confinement, she sued the health department. Upon release, she violated an agreement not to resume cooking and worked at a maternity hospital in Manhattan where more people were infected and died.\n\nCOVID-19 may be caused by a novel coronavirus, but the legal-ethical issues are not new. And just what constitutes the common good has always been a matter of disagreement.\n\nPlato advocated conduct that promotes social harmony. His student, Aristotle, promoted action allowing individuals to fulfill their human purpose. Thus, the debate proceeded.\n\nWhen the United States was founded, a Bill of Rights got locked into the Constitution to ensure that personal liberties were protected from a coercive government.\n\nBut those freedoms are not limitless. One person's right to throw a punch stops at another's nose. If you scream \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater, it could be a ticket to jail.\n\n“Keep in mind we have seat belt laws,” noted Jessica Berg, law school dean and a professor of bioethics at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. \"We have speed limits.”\n\nWhen inoculations for smallpox and polio were first mandated in the past century, backlashes erupted, eventually dying as shots eradicated two of the world’s worst scourges. Yet, Berg noted, some batches of the early polio vaccine had devastating side effects.\n\nThe question is not whether government should constrain personal liberties in the public interest, she concluded, but when and how. With face masks and vaccinations, Berg allows that constraints should result in the least possible loss of choices and the most respect for liberty.\n\nFor example, rather than threats of jail or fines, those who refuse to take precautions might be banned from crowded venues or required to undergo regular testing. The point, Berg said, is to allow for a stand on personal rights by letting people make choices.\n\n“I think if we want to accept the benefits of living in a society,” Berg added, “we also have to accept there are some constraints on individual liberty.”\n\nPamela Hieronymi, a UCLA professor who specializes in moral philosophy, said COVID-19 has revealed the “trickiness of freedoms.” She described various schools of ethical thought, noting that if someone asked four philosophy professors whether vaccines and masks should be mandated, there likely would be four different answers.\n\nThen she mentioned a book – “Assholes: A Theory” – by colleague Aaron James, which argues that American culture is producing a swarm of annoying, self-righteous people who behave as if they are so special that normal rules do not apply.\n\nMore than a lack of civility, Hieronymi said, “we’ve lost sight of the common good.”\n\nNear downtown Los Angeles, social worker Alexandra Sheehy, 37, said she gave birth during the pandemic. As a combat veteran who served in Iraq, she understands that fighting a contagious disease requires a “collective and collaborative effort.”\n\nBut she also worries about how conflict, anger and stress are wounding society and individuals. “I've learned you can’t control everybody,” Sheehy said. “You can only control how you react.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/asia/north-korea-bigger-health-problems-covid-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Is North Korea hiding a bigger problem behind its Covid-19 outbreak ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) Choi Jung-hun smiled as I read out the latest official Covid-19 figures from North Korean state media: fewer than 5 million cases of \"fever\" and just 73 fatalities -- a fraction of the death toll of every other country in the world.\n\n\"North Koreans call them rubber band statistics,\" he said, in a nod toward Pyongyang's flexibility with the truth. \"It's hard even for North Korea to know its own numbers.\"\n\nHe speaks with some authority. Choi was a doctor for more than 10 years in North Korea, specializing in infectious diseases before he fled his home country in 2011.\n\nHe can remember the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, when he says hundreds of people in the northeastern city of Chongjin, where he was working, began dying after reporting \"cold or flu-like symptoms.\"\n\nDoctors like Choi could only privately suspect SARS was to blame. North Korea had no ability to test for the disease, so officially it recorded zero infections. Its neighbor China reported more than 5,000 cases and hundreds of deaths.\n\nChoi can also remember dealing with a nationwide measles outbreak in 2006, armed only with a thermometer; and a 2009 flu pandemic in which even \"more people died than during SARS\" -- a situation made worse by an acute shortage of medicine.\n\nIn previous epidemics, Choi explains, there was never an incentive for local officials to travel house to house to accurately count cases -- they had no masks or gloves and they figured statistics would be massaged by the regime to suit its needs.\n\nHe assumes little has changed since he left and that history, if not exactly repeating itself, is at least rhyming.\n\nWhat's North Korea hiding?\n\nAs with past outbreaks of disease in North Korea, one of the biggest concerns surrounding the country's Covid outbreak is that Pyongyang's penchant for secrecy makes it hard to accurately gauge its severity.\n\nInternational NGOs and most foreign embassies have long vacated the country and tightly sealed borders mean access is impossible, making the accounts of defectors like Choi all the more important.\n\nMany were surprised by Pyongyang's decision in May to admit it was dealing with an outbreak , even if the accuracy of its statements since have faced skepticism . Early on, leader Kim Jong Un had described the outbreak as the \"greatest turmoil\" ever to befall the country. Two months and millions of suspected cases later, he claimed a \"shining success\" in stopping the disease in its tracks.\n\nThe incredibly low official death toll the country has reported inevitably raises suspicions that Pyongyang is trying to hide a bigger problem.\n\n\"I have some questions,\" South Korea's Unification Minister Kwon Young-se said pointedly last week, noting the story being peddled by the North's state-run media contrasted sharply to the experience of the rest of the world.\n\nNew Covid variants, cholera?\n\nThe biggest fear initially was that an outbreak in an unvaccinated, malnourished population with primitive health care would be catastrophic.\n\nTomas Ojea Quintana, UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in North Korea, said knowing the scale of the outbreak is impossible at the moment -- though he had heard unconfirmed reports of deaths among the elderly and malnourished children.\n\n\"At least in my position, I am not able to contrast this fear that we had at the beginning of 2020 about the catastrophic consequences of Covid in (North Korea) and its current situation.\"\n\nThere are also fears that new, possibly more virulent, variants could emerge from unchecked transmission through North Korea's population of about 25 million.\n\nDr. Kee B. Park, an American neurosurgeon who until the pandemic started had been visiting North Korea twice a year to work alongside North Korean counterparts, training them and performing surgeries, said the country seemed unwilling to share information and this was \"not good for them (and) it's not good for the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"We have to share information on any kind of new changes in the characteristics of the virus, for instance, mutations, right,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be aware of the fact that high replication can lead to new variants. The only way to detect that is to share information with each other.\"\n\nA health worker at the Pyongyang Cosmetics Factory takes the temperature of a woman arriving for her shift on June 16.\n\nIn June, North Korea said it was experiencing an outbreak of an unidentified intestinal disease in South Hwanghae Province, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of the capital Pyongyang.\n\nAt the very least, the announcement demonstrated the country's vulnerability to disease outbreaks and its lack of medicines.\n\nPark believes North Korea is probably dealing with an outbreak of typhoid fever or cholera.\n\n\"Somewhere like North Korea, you can expect high rates of infectious diseases. In fact, for children under 5 years of age, diarrheal diseases are the number one killer.\"\n\nA ray of hope?\n\nOne ray of hope for Park was the country's ability to vaccinate its population quickly -- demonstrated during its nationwide inoculation program for the 2006 measles outbreak.\n\n\"The first cycle, they were averaging a million jabs a day, then at the second cycle, later on in 2007, they were averaging over 3 million injections a day,\" Park said.\n\n\"If all conditions are right, based on those numbers, they can vaccinate the entire population at least for the first jab in eight days.\"\n\nBut any optimism is tempered by the reticence of a country sometimes referred to as \"the hermit nation\" to accept outside help.\n\nPeople in Seoul, South Korea, watch a TV news report about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his country's Covid outbreak on May 16, 2022.\n\n\"They're socialized for scarcity,\" Park said. \"They struggled to supply hospitals with some of the things we take for granted,\" he recalled of his time working in the country, saying surgeons would reuse equipment such as scalpels until they were blunt and unusable.\n\nOffers of aid from the United Nations, United States, South Korea and others have all been ignored.\n\nSome aid, however, has made its way into the country from China. Customs data shows from January to April, North Korea imported more than 10 million masks, 1,000 ventilators and more than 2,000 kilograms of unspecified vaccines.\n\nGlobal vaccine alliance Gavi said last month it understood North Korea had accepted Covid vaccines from China and had started administering doses.\n\nA Gavi spokesperson told CNN that North Korea had \"still not submitted a formal request to COVAX for vaccine support but we remain ready to help should they do so.\"\n\nThe isolation of Covid sufferers in the country was highlighted by the recent attempts of a defectors' activist group to send medicine across the demilitarized zone -- the de facto border between North and South Korea.\n\nThe Fighters to Free North Korea said it had sent large balloons carrying medical supplies such as Tylenol and Vitamin C across the border in June as well as some carrying anti-regime leaflets in late April.\n\nThese balloon flights are against South Korean law and have been discouraged. Unification Minister Kwon told reporters he understands \"such organizations' sentiments, but I think they should refrain.\"\n\nStarvation and a second 'Arduous March'\n\nMeanwhile, disease -- whether it's Covid or anything else -- may not be the biggest problem facing North Koreans.\n\nOne defector, 44, who is living in South Korea, said she had been contacted by her family in the North soon after the outbreak was reported. Conversely, when it came to Covid, they were most concerned about her -- a reflection of Pyongyang's considerable propaganda prowess.\n\n\"They said [North Korean television had] reported that many people in South Korea were dying from Covid so they were worried about me,\" she said. \"They weren't very concerned about the virus.\"\n\nWhat her family were extremely worried about, however, was the lack of food.\n\n\"They told me that the food situation was worse than during the Arduous March in the 1990s ... I'm very worried knowing how difficult things were (back then).\"\n\nMembers of the North Korean army supply medicines to residents at a pharmacy in Pyongyang, amid growing fears over the spread of the coronavirus, on May 18.\n\nThe Arduous March refers to a period of devastating famine when North Korea's economy took a hammer blow from the collapse of the Soviet Union, which ended the flow of aid into the country.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people, or as many as 10% of the country's population, are estimated to have starved to death. Some estimates put the death toll even higher.\n\nThe defector did not ask her family whether anyone is dying from starvation as she never talks about anything political during these rare contacts with her family.

And Pelosi's trip is almost certain to create greater instability in the relationship that would make future conflict more likely.\n\nFurious Chinese warnings that the California Democrat shouldn't go and Washington's vows not to be intimidated, meanwhile, show how inflamed political forces in each nation could make it almost impossible to manage the world's most sensitive geopolitical duel.\n\nPelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said in a statement on Tuesday that the visit \"honors America's unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan's vibrant democracy.\"\n\nThe long-time critic of the Chinese communist government and its alleged human rights abuses arrived in Taipei despite extraordinary warnings from Beijing of reprisals and consequences.\n\nAhead of Pelosi's arrival, rhetoric was flying between Washington and Beijing.\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NBC's \"Today\" that China \"should think very carefully\" about escalating the situation and warned the US would do whatever was necessary to protect its interests.\n\nBut China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi renewed President Xi Jinping's warning in a call to President Joe Biden last week that Washington should not \"play with fire\" on Taiwan and reiterated Beijing's \"One China\" policy.\n\nPelosi's position and new conditions created by the nationalistic rule of Xi, as well as Beijing's new assertiveness and military and strategic power, make this the most risky brinkmanship over Taiwan in decades.\n\nGiven that Pelosi is in Taipei, the question has now become how Beijing will respond. Most of its options -- following a barrage of threats and propaganda that have raised expectations for its riposte -- are quite alarming. Most analysts think that some kind of military show of force is likely, at a time when China has already been sending its jets into Taiwan's air defense identification zone in unprecedented numbers. While China's moves may not directly threaten US naval forces in the area, they could add to the potential for miscalculations -- and also raise the prospect of how Taiwan would respond to serious provocations.\n\nWhy would Pelosi go?\n\nSo why did Pelosi go and would her trip needlessly antagonize China's leadership?\n\nSupporters of the visit, who unusually include many Republicans lined up behind Pelosi, say it's critical for the speaker to show support for Taiwan and to underscore Washington is serious about its legal commitment to offer the island the means of its self-defense. Pelosi is also a symbol of democracy -- a way of life that Taipei is desperate to preserve under China's authoritarian shadow.\n\nBut the controversy is not limited to Taiwan. This is about a broader context of China's building challenge to America's determination to preserve democracy, Western values and military and economic primacy in the Pacific and across the world.\n\nOnce news of Pelosi's expected visit leaked, it became politically implausible -- domestically and for strategic reasons -- for her to bend to Beijing's warnings that she should not go. It would be unpalatable for Pelosi, following a political career partly defined by standing up to China, to give up on her plan. And it would send a message that the United States, in one of its first standoffs with a newly confident superpower rival in the Pacific, would back down.\n\nBiden also had political considerations. While he publicly admitted that the US military was worried about the visit, he could not openly side with China over Pelosi. And a President can hardly order one of the top representatives of another branch of government what she should and should not do, even if officials worked to apprise the speaker of all the potential consequences of her decision.\n\nPolitics are driving China's actions too\n\nPolitics rage within the Chinese politburo, too, though many in the West often view China's communist leadership as monolithic. Xi built his power base on aggressive nationalism and the idea that Taiwan's destiny is \"reunification\" with the mainland. He is determined to preside over a national rejuvenation that will purge China's past humiliation over colonialism and long 20th century isolation when it did not wield what he views as its rightful influence in the world.\n\nSo Pelosi's expected visit is more than a jab at China; it's a personal slight to Xi's core project by one of the most senior US politicians -- and is one that demands a political response.\n\nThe crisis also comes at a pivotal moment in Beijing. In a few months, Xi is poised to claim an unusual third term and he cannot afford to be seen as weak. And his government's questionable handling of the Covid-19 pandemic -- mass lockdowns are still common in Chinese cities -- and a slowing economy, mean Xi could be tempted into a nationalistic stand to mask domestic liabilities.\n\nA long festering dispute\n\nWhile the current standoff is alarming, Taiwan has long been an irritant in US-China relations. The dispute is made even more confusing by complicated diplomatic agreements and nuanced US strategic doctrines designed to avoid the possibility of war with China.\n\nThe island is viewed by Beijing as a rightful part of its territory. The United States recognizes the People's Republic of China on the mainland as the sole legitimate government of China and doesn't regard Taiwan as a country. But it doesn't accept the Chinese Communist Party's claim of sovereignty over the democratic island. While it offers Taiwan the means of self defense when it buys US made weapons, Washington has adopted a policy of purposeful vagueness over whether it would itself defend Taiwan, partly to deter a declaration of independence from Taipei and to give leaders in Beijing second thoughts about a forceful takeover of the island.\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch Robert Daly's interview with CNN Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch Robert Daly's interview with CNN 02:58\n\nRobert Daly, a former US diplomat in Beijing, said Monday that China's eventual response -- perhaps, for example, an incursion into Taiwanese airspace, was unlikely to cause a war but would push the rivals closer to a danger zone.\n\n\"That will set up a new baseline that leads us slightly closer to confrontation,\" Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, told CNN's Pamela Brown.\n\n\"I don't think that we will be at confrontation this time around, but I don't think we will be better off in our relations with Beijing a week from now than we are today.\"\n\nWhy Biden worries about the trip\n\nBiden has reorganized US foreign policy around the principle of countering China's growing might in Asia and further afield. Thirty years ago, Washington hoped that by encouraging then-reclusive China into the global economy it could promote political liberalization and usher it into the Western-oriented global economic and political system. But Beijing has sought to use its rising military and political power and influence to build an alternative political and economic value system to the one represented by the US and its allies.\n\nBut Biden also wants to manage this new competitive relationship so that it does not result in war between the rising power in the Pacific (China) and the existing one (the United States) and its allies.\n\nThe US leader stressed in a telephone call with Xi last week that there has been no change to the fundamental nature of US-China relations or the position of the White House when it comes to Taiwan. Yet seen from Beijing, Biden's repeated recent statements that the US would defend Taiwan, which were all walked back by aides, may have left an impression that he is not sincere.\n\nJUST WATCHED Expect a 'colorful response' from China over Pelosi Taiwan visit, says former Australia PM Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Expect a 'colorful response' from China over Pelosi Taiwan visit, says former Australia PM 14:58\n\nChina is also watching a growing movement among hawks in Congress for Washington to replace the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" over US intentions if China invades Taiwan for a clear statement that the US would defend the island.\n\nSome analysts say such a shift could not only risk dragging the United States into a war in the Pacific against China that Americans are not prepared for, but that it could also make Beijing even more aggressive. Or that the promise of a US shield could embolden a push for independence in Taiwan that could also force China's hand and bring a broader military conflict over the island closer.\n\nAhead of Pelosi's visit, official statements by administration officials firmly restated that there had been no change to US policy and affirmed her right to travel but hinted at the possibility of a rocky few weeks when China responds in whatever form.\n\n\"There's no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There's no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,\" the White House's National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said during an appearance on CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday.\n\n\"We shouldn't be, as a country, intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions.\"\n\nBut in a new statement on Monday, Zhang Jun, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, warned again that China's military would not \"sit by idly\" as Pelosi visits and that her trip would have an \"egregious political impact.\"\n\nThe assumption in Washington is that Xi has no more interest in a direct military showdown than Biden does. But he's stronger than previous Chinese leaders. And there is a strongly nationalist streak within the Chinese military along with growing confidence about its capacity.\n\nSo making assumptions about how China would respond to Pelosi's visit based on its behavior in past crises that have blown over might mean the US is in for an unpleasant surprise.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Analysis Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-resignation-intl/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson: UK Prime Minister resigns after mutiny in his party ...", "text": "London (CNN) Boris Johnson's turbulent tenure as Britain's Prime Minister came to an end Thursday after a historic party revolt over a series of ethics scandals forced him to step down.\n\nIt took the resignation of nearly 60 members of his government -- almost half the payroll -- for Johnson to finally abandon his attempts to cling on to power. Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down -- without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n\"It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,\" he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet \"to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.\" Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how \"painful\" it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n\"In the last few days, I've tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we're delivering so much... and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it's painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,\" he said, adding that he's proud of \"getting Brexit done\" and \"leading the West in standing up to Putin's aggression in Ukraine.\"\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n\"To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,\" he said. \"And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them's the breaks.\"\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street's botched handling of the resignation by Johnson's former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis -- despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister's Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn't going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the \"right decision\" to resign. \"We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,\" she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a \"duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.\"\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was \"good news for the country\" that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that \"it should have happened long ago.\"\n\n\"He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,\" said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. \"They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,\" Starmer said.\n\n\"Enough is enough.

Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent \"routine\" operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain's PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n\"I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it's agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that's fine with me,\" Baker told CNN. \"Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.\"\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be \"unwise and may be unsustainable\" for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen.

But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/08/01/faq-delta-variant-covid-michigan-vaccine-mandates-cdc-masks/5386688001/", "title": "FAQ: COVID-19 delta variant, vaccine mandates and masks", "text": "Just a few weeks after President Joe Biden celebrated Independence Day on the South Lawn of the White House, declaring a major victory in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, the nation is in retreat yet again.\n\nCases and hospitalizations are climbing in every state across the U.S. as warning bells sound about the ultra-contagious delta variant that spreads at the fastest clip of any mutation seen yet.\n\nIt has led to sweeping changes in public health guidelines, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced new recommendations for mask-wearing last week, and a wave of COVID-19 vaccine mandates flooded the tech industry, the public sector, the health care industry and higher education.\n\nThe Free Press found answers to some of the biggest questions people have now about the new guidelines, the mandates, the vaccines and the variant. Here's what you need to know:\n\nIs the delta variant a big deal?\n\nYes, the delta variant is a big deal.\n\n\"I’ve not seen this level of anxiety from everyone since the beginning of the pandemic,\" wrote Katelyn Jetelina, an assistant professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, in her Your Local Epidemiologist blog.\n\n\"There are big headlines, leaked CDC documents, scientists speaking out, reports of filled hospitals, including pediatric ICU’s (intensive care units). It’s like we are in a terrible movie. … The sky is not falling, but the world is on fire. Stay vigilant.

So far, Michigan has mostly been spared, but a growing number of counties in the state — many along the Michigan borders with Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio — now have high or substantial rates of transmission.\n\nThe number of delta variant cases statewide confirmed with whole genome sequencing more than doubled in the span of three days last week — rising from 88 known cases on Tuesday to 182 on Friday, the state health department reported.\n\nThe delta variant is causing more breakthrough cases among fully vaccinated people than other strains of the virus, too.\n\n\"So bottom line?\" Jha tweeted. \"Yeah, delta variant is bad. Like really bad. Our vaccines are good. Like really good. Breakthrough infections happen. Sometimes they may spread to others. But if enough people get the shot the pandemic does come to an end.\"\n\nHow effective are COVID-19 vaccines against the delta variant?\n\nThey work well to prevent severe illness and death from the delta variant, and they reduce the risk of infection, research suggests.\n\nVaccinated people are three times less likely to contract the delta variant and 10 times less likely to die from it than those who are unvaccinated, the leaked documents obtained by the Post show.\n\nThe Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is 80%-90% effective against symptomatic infection and 90% to 95% effective against severe disease from the delta variant in data from other countries, Jha said. Because the Moderna vaccine uses a similar mRNA technology, it performs similarly against the delta variant.\n\nStill, about 35,000 vaccinated Americans are having breakthrough infections every week, the CDC documents show.\n\n\"Sound high?\" Jha asked in a tweet. \"Actually, probably 300K unvaccinated Americans (are) having infections weekly. And given 50% of Americans are vaccinated that's a rough vaccine effectiveness of around 88%. Very rough.\"\n\nThere's less data available about how well the Johnson & Johnson vaccines hold up against the delta variant.\n\nThe company issued an encouraging report July 1 from a pair of small studies that suggest eight months after people get the vaccine, they still produce neutralizing antibodies and have T-cell responses to protect against the delta variant. The company's report was later published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAnd virtually all hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. right now are among unvaccinated people, Biden said Thursday.\n\n\"This is an American tragedy,\" he said. \"People are dying and will die who don't have to die. If you're out there unvaccinated, you don't have to die. ... It's preventable.\"\n\nCan vaccinated people spread the delta variant?\n\nYes. Several recent studies studies suggest vaccinated people who develop a breakthrough case of the delta variant carry a high viral load in their bodies and shed the virus just as efficiently as people who are unvaccinated.\n\nThat is among the reasons why the CDC on Tuesday changed its guidelines, recommending all Americans — whether vaccinated or not — resume wearing masks indoors in parts of the country where transmission is considered high or substantial. That's in places where more than 50 new cases per 100,000 people are being diagnosed weekly or where the percentage of positive coronavirus tests is 8% or higher.\n\n\"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with delta can transmit the virus,\" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, in a statement issued Friday.\n\n\"This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC’s updated mask recommendation. The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones.\"\n\nPeople who have compromised immune systems may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated and should wear masks.\n\nHow will I know if there's a high or substantial rate of transmission where I live?\n\nThe data is changing quickly as the virus spreads. Most of the country is now seeing so much spread of the delta variant, the CDC says it's time to return to mask wearing in indoor, public places.\n\nAs of Friday evening, Michigan was among only a few states in the U.S. that still fell below the CDC's threshold for high or substantial spread overall. But 19 counties in the state had transmission rates that were considered high or substantial.\n\nMichiganders in four counties in the Upper Peninsula and 15 in the Lower Peninsula should be wearing masks whether they are fully vaccinated or not.\n\nThose counties are: Delta, Dickinson, Iron Ontonogan, Charlevoix, Benzie, Alpena, Kalkaksa, Montmorency, Arenac, Mason, Saginaw, Ionia, Allegan, Van Buren, Cass, Branch, Hillsdale and Jackson.\n\nIt's best to check the CDC's COVID data tracker website regularly and look for the county on the map where you live: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view. If your county is red or orange, you should wear a mask when indoors.\n\nYou can also opt to wear a mask for safe measure regardless of the level of community spread where you live.\n\nMy employer says I must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to come to work. Is that legal?\n\nYes, it is. In late May, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission clarified that no law prevents an employer from \"requiring all employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated for COVID-19, so long as employers comply with the reasonable accommodation provisions\" under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, along with other EEO considerations.\n\nThat means a person with a true medical reason not to get the vaccine, such as an allergy to the components, or someone who has a religious objection to vaccination may be entitled to an exemption under the law.\n\nSupporting the EEOC guidance, the U.S. Justice Department solidified employers' right to vaccine mandates in a July legal opinion.\n\nIt found that even though coronavirus vaccines have yet to win full authorization by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, both public and private employers — as well as universities and school districts — still have the authority to require their workers to be immunized.\n\nWhat hospitals in Michigan have mandated COVID-19 vaccines so far?\n\nHenry Ford Health System became the first health care organization in Michigan to mandate vaccines for all employees, contractors, students and volunteers. The Detroit-based hospital system made the announcement June 29, and the deadline for its 33,000 workers to be fully vaccinated is Sept. 10.\n\nMore:Henry Ford West Bloomfield employees protest COVID vaccine mandate\n\nMore:Beaumont 2nd Michigan health system in 1 day to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for workers\n\nTrinity Health announced July 8 that it will require all of its 117,000 employees in 22 states, along with its contractors and others conducting business in its hospitals and other facilities, to get coronavirus vaccines. That includes about 24,000 Trinity Health Michigan employees at five St. Joseph Mercy Health System hospitals, three Mercy Health hospitals, and two medical groups — IHA and Mercy Health Physician Partners. The deadline for Trinity Health workers to get fully vaccinated is Sept. 21.\n\nOSF HealthCare, with nearly 24,000 employees at 150 sites in Illinois and Michigan, including OSF St. Francis Hospital & Medical Group in Escanaba, followed suit July 21. It will require all its employees — with the exception of Michigan Nursing Association bargaining unit members — to be fully vaccinated by the end of September.\n\nA wave of vaccine mandates were announced last week, after 50 medical national health care organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, issued a joint statement in support of COVID-19 vaccine requirements for all workers in health and long-term care.\n\nAscension Health, along with Veterans Health Administration facilities, Beaumont Health, Spectrum Health and Michigan Medicine all announced they, too, would require COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat other workplaces have mandated COVID-19 vaccines? Could mine be next?\n\nIt's possible. The number of businesses now requiring vaccination as a condition of employment or telling workers that they must be vaccinated or submit to regular COVID-19 testing is on the rise.\n\nBiden announced Thursday that all federal workers — more than 4 million Americans, including 2 million in the civilian workforce in the U.S. and around the world — must either attest to being fully vaccinated or wear a mask and comply with weekly or twice weekly coronavirus testing.

Many have since been removed by censors after sparking public anger.\n\nThe outcry comes as authorities appear to have walked back efforts to ease restrictions in parts of the city, despite a drop in new infections, as local officials come under pressure to curb community transmission of the virus.\n\nUnder the new hardline policies, even residents with negative Covid tests can find themselves placed into centralized government quarantine. According to social media posts and local government notices circulating online, in several parts of the city, entire apartment blocks have been deemed a health risk, with all occupants forced from their homes and placed into quarantine on the back of one positive case.\n\nOne viral video shows residents arguing with police officers who showed up at their doors in hazmat suits to take them to quarantine after someone else on their floor tested positive.\n\nJUST WATCHED Shanghai police barge down door in resident's apartment Replay More Videos ...

CNN has not been able to identify the people who took the video and does not know if they were later taken to quarantine.\n\nAccording to notices online, some neighborhoods have imposed so called \"silent periods\" lasting for two or three days, during which residents are not permitted to leave their homes. These residents have also been temporarily banned from ordering groceries and daily essentials online, leading to renewed fears of food shortages.\n\nPublic outrage were further inflamed after accounts emerged on social media that some residents had been forced to hand over their house keys so that health workers could disinfect their homes while they were away in quarantine.\n\nSeveral videos circulating online showed workers in hazmat suits spraying clouds of disinfectant over furniture and appliances inside apartments, from couches, televisions, bookshelves, beds to wardrobes.\n\nOn China's internet, some questioned the scientific basis of the measure -- experts have transmission of the virus via contaminated surfaces is exceptionally low -- while others lamented the disregard for private property rights.\n\n\"The apartments are our private property, which we bought with millions or tens of millions of yuan. Why should we allow you in? This is no different than robbery!\" a Shanghai resident said on China's Twitter-like Weibo.\n\nThe escalation follows the personal intervention of Xi, who on Thursday issued what many interpreted as a threat to opponents of the zero-Covid policy, making clear he would not tolerate \"acts that distort, doubt or deny our country's epidemic prevention policies.\"\n\nXi also demanded officials demonstrate a \"profound, complete and comprehensive understanding\" of the policy and warned them against \"inadequate awareness, inadequate preparation and insufficient work\" in implementing it.\n\nHours after Xi's speech, the Shanghai municipal Communist Party committee met on Thursday evening to study his instructions. And at a press conference Sunday, the Shanghai municipal health commission said the city was at a \"critical moment\" for controlling the outbreak.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lockdowns in China turn millions into virtual prisoners Replay More Videos ...

On Weibo, Tong's verified account has been banned from posting since Monday. A hashtag of his name has also been censored.\n\nIn thinly veiled sarcasm, some internet users shared a 2015 article from the People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, quoting Xi months after he took the helm of the Party in 2012: \"No organization or individual has the privilege to be above the constitution and the law. Any act that violates the constitution and the law must be investigated and accounted for.\"\n\nAs the post started making the rounds, users were soon greeted with a glaring message saying \"the content has been removed by the author.\"", "authors": ["Nectar Gan", "Cnn'S Beijing Bureau"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}]}

It doesn't feel like a modern word to me. I've been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I'm up to is evolution. I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Unfortunately I wasn't ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don't know if I will be ready to win New York. But I'm going to try.\"\n\nSince losing her professional debut in September 1995, Williams has become the most dominant force in women's tennis in the last 30 years.\n\nTogether with her old sister Venus, the Williams sisters transformed the sport, making a regular habit of winning grand slams in both singles and doubles tennis.\n\nAt the time of writing, Serena has won 73 career singles titles, 23 doubles titles and two mixed doubles titles which includes 39 grand slam titles -- 23 singles titles, 14 doubles titles and two mixed doubles titles. She is one singles grand slam title behind the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court.\n\nWhen asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this year if she still wanted to beat Court's record, she replied: \"I should have had it, really, I should -- I've had many opportunities to have it. But I'm not giving up, to answer your question.\"\n\nShe addressed this later in Vogue, saying: \"I know there's a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, 'See ya!' I get that. It's a good fantasy. But I'm not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I'm terrible at goodbyes, the world's worst.\"\n\nThe four-time Olympic gold medalist has won over $94.5 million in career prize money, more than any other female athlete.\n\nAway from the court, Williams announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in 2016, giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.\n\nJUST WATCHED Tennis legend's daughter joins her on the court Replay More Videos ...

I don't think it's fair,\" Williams explained. \"If I were a guy, I wouldn't be writing this because I'd be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.\n\n\"Maybe I'd be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don't get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital -- although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don't realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I'm turning 41 this month, and something's got to give.\"\n\nThe star also admitted she doesn't like to think about her legacy.\n\n\"I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I'd like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all.\n\n\"Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis.\"", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/tennis/957611/serena-williams-evolution-away-from-tennis", "title": "Serena Williams and her 'evolution' away from tennis | The Week UK", "text": "Such is her standing in the worlds of sport and culture, it was no surprise that Serena Williams announced her imminent retirement from tennis by writing an intimate first-person essay in Vogue. In its September issue, the fashion magazine said the 40-year-old would bid farewell to tennis “on her own terms – and in her own words”.\n\nIn fact retirement is not a term that she’s ever liked, “it doesn’t feel like a modern word to me”, she wrote. “I’ve been thinking of this as a transition. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”\n\nA few years ago Williams “quietly started” Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, she started a family. “I want to grow that family.”\n\n‘I should have had 30-plus slams’\n\nIt’s “almost the end of an era”, said Amy Lofthouse on BBC Sport. As “one of the greatest tennis players of all time” and a “sporting icon”, it will be “difficult to imagine tennis without the American legend”, who has won “all there is to win” during her 27-year career.\n\nA winner of 23 grand slam singles titles in the open era, Williams is just one behind the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court. In her essay she suggested that the 2022 US Open, which starts on 29 August, will be her farewell event. It was in New York, as a “braided 17-year-old phenomenon”, where she lifted the family’s “first major title” in 1999, said Bryan Armen Graham in The Guardian. Her older sister Venus, a seven-time grand slam champion, won the US Open major a year later and in 2001.\n\nWithin reach of Court’s 24 slams, Williams would “be lying” if she said she didn’t want that record. “Obviously I do,” she wrote. “But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams.”\n\nWith 23 slams and 73 career titles, Williams has “set the marker that matters”, said Tumaini Carayol in The Guardian. “No asterisks needed”, her tennis legacy “goes far beyond statistics”.\n\nIn Vogue’s September issue, @serenawilliams prepares to say farewell to tennis on her own terms and in her own words. “It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine,” she says. “I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next” https://t.co/6Zr0UXVTH1 pic.twitter.com/YtGtcc18a9 — Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) August 9, 2022\n\n‘It hurts like a 120mph serve to the stomach’\n\nWilliams’ retirement will be “a crushing loss” for tennis, said Johnny Oleksinski in the New York Post. “Without a doubt”, she is a “once-in-a-generation athlete” on the “same godlike level” as Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, LeBron James or Tom Brady. “The sports world will be a lot less ferocious or fascinating without her.” We all knew this sad day was coming, but it “still hurts like a 120-miles-per-hour serve to the stomach”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/tennis/gallery/serena-williams-life-in-pictures/index.html", "title": "Photos: Tennis legend Serena Williams", "text": "Scott Barbour/Getty Images Serena Williams waves to the crowd after winning the Australian Open in 2017.

And it’s almost certainly going to lead to this generation of champions leaving while they still have something — even if it’s not their best — left to give.\n\nThere’s no way to spin the 39-year old Federer’s 6-3, 7-6, 6-0 loss to Hubert Hurkacz in Wednesday’s Wimbledon quarterfinal as anything other than an ominous sign for his chances of winning a 21st Grand Slam title. Williams, whether it’s her inconsistent tennis or injury issues, seems further away from adding her long-sought 24th Slam now than she was a year ago. Even Rafael Nadal started to look a bit old and tired in his French Open semifinal loss last month to Novak Djokovic, and after a comprehensive third-round Wimbledon loss, it seems like the ceiling for Andy Murray’s comeback from hip surgery is well below what it takes to win one of these.\n\nSo what?\n\nEvery tennis great has to decide whether the training and effort it takes to compete at the highest level is worth it for them when the reward is no longer winning the biggest titles. It’s totally understandable if these players, who have long passed the point of grinding like this for money or legacy, just say enough’s enough.\n\nBut we don’t need to collectively push them out the door just because they’re going to have days like Federer where he can’t keep the forehand in the court against a top-20 player who is 15 years younger.\n\n“I definitely need to be a better player if want to be more competitive at the highest of levels,” a downtrodden Federer said. “I knew that coming in. Better players remind you of that like Hurkacz.”\n\nOSAKA:'It's OK to not be OK'; standing up for mental health 'all worth it'\n\nWIMBLEDON:Current No. 1 Barty to face former No. 1 Pliskova in women's final\n\nFederer didn’t commit to much of anything in the immediate aftermath of the quarterfinal loss, just like Williams has completely dodged questions after the Australian Open and the French Open about whether she had made her last appearances on those courts. It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if both of them simply said goodbye at the end of this season.\n\nBut this is where tennis fails miserably in putting its legends into proper perspective.\n\nJust to get to the quarterfinals, Federer got through the 41st-ranked player in the world in Adrian Mannarino and the No. 56 in Richard Gasquet before completely taking apart No. 34 Cameron Norrie and No. 27 Lorenzo Sonego. It’s also worth noting that he got to the fourth round at the French Open before pulling out as a precautionary measure for his still-recovering knee. To do that just shy of 40 years old, having come off of two knee surgeries last year, is a remarkable testament to his talent and the fact that he can still beat really good players week in and week out.\n\nAsk yourself: Is tennis better or worse for Federer continuing to do that, even if it means he’ll throw in a dud now and then or run into a brick wall at the later stages of a Grand Slam?\n\nTennis has long been a sport where the mentality is to get out as soon as you’re not viable anymore in the biggest events. In the era right before Federer and Williams began to dominate, you saw Pete Sampras get out at 31, Stefan Edberg play his last Grand Slam at age 30 and Steffi Graf call it a career at 30. They didn’t wait once things started to decline.\n\nGranted, tennis isn’t like other sports. You can’t transition into a different role coming off the bench or become a backup quarterback when you get older.\n\nBut you would have never heard anyone — particularly those who run tournaments and have to market the game — calling for Phil Mickelson to stop playing the PGA Tour because he went through a couple year stretch where he didn’t contend in any tournaments. If and when Tiger Woods comes ever back from the injuries he sustained in his February car accident, you won’t find people suggesting he shouldn’t play if he shoots a bunch of 75s.\n\nThe mentality in tennis needs to change. There’s more to the sport than just the Grand Slams, and there should be value in seeing great players compete even if they’re no longer physically able to be the best in the world.\n\nEven in his older form, there aren’t many better tennis players in the world than Federer. He’s still capable of beautiful strokes, entertaining rallies and incredible artistry on the court, and he can still beat most of the top guys. Williams was just in a Grand Slam semifinal in January. As bleak as it looked for Murray against Denis Shapovalov at Wimbledon, he played a brilliant match in the first round against No. 28 Nikoloz Basilashvili. They’re not as good as they’ve been, but they’re still better at this sport than everybody in the world except a few handful of people.\n\nThink about that for a second when we try to push them into retirement.\n\nAs we come face-to-face with the reality that these great players of tennis’ golden era are more mortal than they’ve been, the goal should be to see them play as much as they’ll allow us. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Wimbledon or Delray Beach, Florida. They don’t need to win Grand Slams to make it worthwhile. They just need to keep showing up.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/tennis/serena-williams-grand-slam-amanpour-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Serena Williams: 'I should have been at like 30 or 32' grand slam ...", "text": "(CNN) Widely considered to be the GOAT of women's tennis , 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams says she's still aiming to beat Margaret Court's record of 24.\n\n\"I should have been at like 30 or 32 (grand slam singles titles),\" Williams told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\n\n\"I should have had it (the record), really, I've had many opportunities to have it.

It's a lot of work.\"\n\nSerena's older sister Venus paved the way, turning professional one year earlier than her, winning seven grand slam singles titles so far in her career. Venus still competes on the tour, aged 41.\n\nInitially, Serena lived in Venus' shadow.\n\n\"My sister was much better than me. I was not very good growing up. And so, everyone was focused on Venus. And in the film, it goes into that, how when we had an opportunity to have better coaches, they saw that Venus was the one.\n\n\"And so, that was devastating for me ... but helpful. Because if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have had the career that I have because I felt like I just had to prove and just had to win.\"\n\nSerena and Venus attend the premiere of Warner Bros' \"King Richard\" in Hollywood in November 2021.\n\nWilliams turned to her mother, Oracene Price, who played a critical but often overlooked role in her success.\n\n\"I just had to work with mom. I didn't get to work with the prestigious coaches or anything. And my mom made me tough mentally,\" she added.\n\n'We had to be better'\n\nSerena, Venus and their dad came up against racism throughout their careers, most notably in 2001 at Indian Wells\n\nAsked by Amanpour how they perceived and overcame the racism that they experienced as tennis players in a predominantly White sport, Williams responded: \"We changed it from being two great Black champions to being the best ever, period. And that's what we did. We took out color, and we just became the best.\n\n\"And yes, we had to play harder, and we had to be better, but it made us better.\n\n\"And at the end of the day, every time we faced a challenge and every time we overcame that challenge, we created Venus and Serena.\"\n\nWilliams also discussed her venture fund Serena Ventures, which this week announced $111 million had been raised to invest in founders of diverse backgrounds.\n\n\"It's really about diversity,\" Williams told Amanpour, explaining that she was spurred to action when she learnt that less than 2% of all venture capital money went to women.\n\n\"Because of tennis, I have a way to impact VC in a different way and bringing diversity to that as well,\" she said.\n\nVenus (L) defeated sister Serena in an all-Williams 2008 Wimbledon final.\n\nDouble standards\n\nAt times, Williams has shown anger and exasperation with umpires on the court, most infamously at the 2018 US Open final which she lost to Naomi Osaka\n\nShe was heavily criticized and fined over the episode.\n\nAmanpour asked Williams if she feels double standards exist in the sport, given men routinely act out at umpires, often with impunity.\n\nWilliams argues with umpire Carlos Ramos during her US Open final match against Osaka in 2018.\n\nResponding to a recent incident involving German player Alexander Zverev, in which he struck the umpire's chair multiple times with his racket and was subsequently withdrawn from the Mexican Open and fined, Williams said: \"There is absolutely a double standard. I would probably be in jail if I did that. Like literally, no joke.\"\n\nAnd as she chases Court's grand slam record, Williams is also aware that her career and life won't only be defined by how many titles she might win.\n\n\"I am who I am, I love who I am -- I love the impact that I've had on people, that I continue to have on people,\" said Williams, who Amanpour interviewed on February 28, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"Right now the world in such turmoil ... when you look at what's happening in Ukraine and Russia, it's just sad to see,\" added Williams.\n\n\"Human life ... is so valuable, and it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, it should be amazing and of value.\"", "authors": ["Alicia Lloyd", "Christiane Amanpour"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/tennis/serena-williams-wimbledon-return-intl-spt/index.html", "title": "Serena Williams handed wild card entry for Wimbledon return | CNN", "text": "London (CNN) Seven-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams will make her much-anticipated return to the grass courts of SW19 when the tournament kicks off later this month, after being handed a wild card entry to arguably the most famous tennis tournament in the world.\n\nWilliams will compete in ladies' singles, according to an announcement from Wimbledon Tuesday.\n\nThe American also hinted at the highly anticipated news: \"SW and SW19,\" Williams posted on Instagram Tuesday. \"It's a date. 2022, see you there.\" SW19 is the postcode district in Southwest London incorporating Wimbledon, among other boroughs.\n\nThe social media post showed her standing on a grass court with white sneakers on.\n\nWilliams has not played competitively since an injury forced her to retire in a first-round match at Wimbledon last year.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Sammy Mngqosini", "Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/08/19/sloane-stephens-new-haven-open-first-round-results/2675101/", "title": "Sloane Stephens, Caroline Wozniacki win at New Haven Open", "text": "AP\n\nSloane Stephens topped Anna Schmiedlova 6-4%2C 6-4 to advance in the New Haven Open\n\nFifth-seeded Roberta Vinci was upset by Carla Suarez Navarro\n\nCaroline Wozniacki advanced after Peng Shuai was forced to retire\n\nNEW HAVEN, Conn.

I am looking forward to the enshrinement weekend in Newport and to being welcomed in by the other Hall of Famers.\"\n\nHingis was No. 1 in singles for 209 weeks overall, and No. 1 in doubles for 35 weeks, joining the elite company of Martina Navratilova, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Lindsay Davenport and Kim Clijsters as the only players to be No. 1 in singles and doubles simultaneously.\n\nHingis ended up with 15 major titles, five in singles and 10 in doubles.\n\nAfter her dominant 1997 season, Hingis was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year, the WTA Player of the Year, and the ITF Player of the Year.\n\n\"Many congratulations to Martina. She's such a great person,\" Serena Williams said Monday at a news conference in advance of the BNP Paribas Showdown. \"I'm happy for her.

It was definitely inevitable and she's so young to be in the Hall of Fame so it's pretty awesome.\"\n\nHingis first retired in 2003, at 22, citing a series of injuries and playing in pain. She made a comeback in 2006, winning two titles that year and closing the season at No. 7. She won her final title in 2007, the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, before officially retiring.\n\nAt times in her career, controversy followed her.\n\n•She had a difficult rivalry early with Venus and Serena Williams, questioning their claims of racism and suggesting they had \"big mouths.\"\n\n•In 1999 she said about Amelie Mauresmo, who was big and strong and open about being a lesbian, she's \"half a man.\"\n\n•In 2007 Hingis announced she was under investigation for testing positive for cocaine. She denied using the drug but decided to retire rather than face a suspension.\n\nSince retirement, she has been active in World TeamTennis, and in 2011, she partnered with Lindsay Davenport to win the Roland Garros Legends title.

Drysdale, 71, has been on the air with ESPN since the network's very first tennis telecast — a Davis Cup match between the USA and Argentina on Sept. 14, 1979, one week after ESPN's debut.\n\nDrysdale has been named \"Best Tennis Announcer\" by the readers of Tennis magazine four times.\n\n\"Tennis had given me everything,\" Drysdale said at the announcement ceremony. \"For the small part that I played in it, maybe I've done something to help the game, but I will say that the game has done a heck of a lot more to help me than I have for the game.

Originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico, Pasarell has been a longtime resident of California.\n\n\"It's going to be an incredible, daunting experience to be there among so many people I have admired and idolized for so many years,\" Pasarell said. \"It's going to be a very emotional thing for me. It's hard to find the words to express how excited, pleased and emotional I am about it.\"\n\nBefore becoming a driving force in the leadership of the sport, Pasarell was an outstanding player. He won the 1966 singles and doubles NCAA titles at UCLA. In 1967 he was the highest-ranked American player. He played on five U.S. Davis Cup teams, winning the title in 1968. And he claimed 18 singles titles, including the U.S. National Indoor Championships in 1966 and 1967. Pasarell joined Drysdale as one of the founders of the ATP, and he served on the board during the crucial early years.\n\nIn 1969, Pasarell partnered with Arthur Ashe and Sheriden Snyder to launch National Junior Tennis & Learning. The goal of the organization was to have a positive impact on at-risk children by introducing them to tennis. The program continues to be the largest grassroots tennis program in the USA, with more than 950 chapters.\n\nPasarell helped build the Indian Wells event into one of the biggest, best-attended, most popular events on the tour. The event, which started with a 7,500-seat stadium court, now has a 24-court, 54-acre complex including a 16,100-seat main stadium, seven smaller stadiums, and 44 luxury suites.\n\nTiriac, in the contributor category: Tiriac, 73, has been an influential tennis leader in roles ranging from coach to player manager to tournament promoter. In the 1970s, Tiriac and fellow Romanian Ilie Nastase partnered to form a successful doubles team.\n\nTiriac took a sharp, business-like approach to tennis and he worked tirelessly to promote the players, grow the tournaments, and build up interest in the sport through television broadcasts. He went on to manage the careers of top players including Hall of Famer Guillermo Vilas, Mary Joe Fernandez, Goran Ivanisevic, and most notably, Hall of Famer Boris Becker, who won five Grand Slam titles while working with Tiriac.\n\nTiriac was a promoter and tournament director for numerous events including the ATP World Tour's season-ending Masters Grand Prix, and two of the largest Masters 1000 events, the Italian Open and the Madrid Masters.

You had two of the biggest, bold-face names in the sport, Serena and Maria, last names optional. You had a big-event buzz, and a phalanx of photographers training their cameras on every move.\n\nIt was Legends Night at the U.S. Open on Monday, about five or six rounds before you would’ve expected it. The only trouble was that for a decade and a half, the rivalry between the bold faces has been marginally more competitive than the Harlem Globetrotters and the Washington Generals.\n\nAnd so it was again on the blue hardcourt of Arthur Ashe Stadium. Serena Williams put on a display of punishing power and unrelenting pressure, her old indomitable self, as if she had turned the calendar back a decade or so, as if she wanted to administer this 6-1, 6-1 pummeling of Maria Sharapova to impress the smartly dressed bearded fellow in the President’s box, Mike Tyson, who knows a few things about quick knockouts.\n\nIn scoring her 19th consecutive victory over Sharapova, Williams abruptly changed her troublesome recent narrative. She may be the greatest player ever, but Williams is also a 37-year-old mother who has been gripped by back spasms for most of a month. She was forced to retire from the finals of the WTA stop in Toronto earlier this month, and then withdraw from Cincinnati a few days later. It raised questions about her health, and her ability to withstand the seven-round rigors of a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nThis opening night was the perfect balm for No. 8 Williams, who seemed to announce herself fully ready to resume her quest for a 24th major title, which would tie her for the record with Margaret Court.\n\nBack spasms? What back spasms?\n\nSomeone asked if she feels this is her tournament to win, even though she hasn’t won the Open since 2014.\n\n“Yeah, I feel like I'm here to do that,” Williams said. “We'll see what happens.”\n\nTHREE REASONS: Serena will win the U.S. Open\n\nALTHEA GIBSON: Tennis legend honored with statue after children write letters\n\nTEEN SENSATION: Coco Gauff finds role model in Michelle Obama\n\nWilliams has lost the last three finals she has been in – the last two Wimbledons and here at the Open last September, when she behaved badly, got penalized a game and wound up getting drubbed by Naomi Osaka, unquestionably one of the low points of her storied career.\n\nSo the finishing has not gone especially well of late for Williams, and the Ashe crowd clearly reveled in seeing her in peak form, even if it came against Sharapova, a player she is now 20-2 against and has lost only three sets to in the past 15 years.\n\nThe 32-year-old Sharapova, of course, has had long-running injury issues of her own, limiting her to 14 matches this year, which begins to explain her No. 87 ranking and why she won the last of her five Grand Slams five years ago – and why, without the protection of a seed, she was subject to the whims of a random draw.\n\nSharapova’s service game has long been fragile, and now, in the wake of a shoulder procedure earlier this year, the weakness is even more glaring. The difference between the two players was striking, Williams dominating with her serve and groundstroke power, moving Sharapova around like a chess piece, Sharapova seeming ill-equipped to deal with any of it.\n\nHow bad was it for Sharapova? She did not win a single point on her second serve in the match.\n\n“I think the most frustrating part has been the shoulder,” Sharapova said. “You can do all the work in the world, but if you can’t go out and hit serves, it’s pretty tough. That’s been my biggest challenge.”\n\nWilliams seized control of the match early, forging a break to go up 3-1 in the first when Sharapova netted a backhand, then closing it out minutes later, finishing the set with a forehand approach that caught the net cord and trickled over.\n\nSharapova was broken again to start the second set, and looked about to get drummed out onto Grand Central Parkway before she got to double break point at 15-40 of the fourth game. But Sharapova muffed a return and Williams got back to deuce with a spectacular backhand winner down the line. It was a championship-caliber shot at a critical moment in the match, a point that cut Sharapova like a dagger.\n\nLegends Night was over not long after. Williams was free to go home and play with her daughter, Olympia, and start preparations for her second-round opponent, 17-year-old Caty McNally, a wild card from Cincinnati who is ranked No. 121. McNally also happends to be the doubles partner of Coco Gauff, the 15-year-old wunderkind from Delray Beach, Florida. She said she has been training very hard, working on new things in her game that she wouldn’t disclose. The plan is to avoid another ugly ending, and get to title No. 24.\n\n“I’ve always been really mentally strong,” Williams said. “I've always been really physically strong. I think just putting those two together at an event would be the biggest obstacle for me.”\n\nFollow Wayne Coffey on Twitter @wr_coffey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/tennis/simona-halep-patrick-mouratoglou-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Simona Halep: 'He brought that fire back': How Patrick Mouratoglou ...", "text": "(CNN) This time last year, Simona Halep was on the brink of retirement.\n\nThe former women's world No. 1 had announced her withdrawal from the 2021 edition of French Open due to a calf injury. Later that season, she also deferred from Wimbledon , and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics\n\n\"I felt exhausted and I felt that there is no chance I can be in the top anymore,\" Halep told CNN Sport's Christina Macfarlane in an exclusive interview with her new coach, Patrick Mouratoglou . \"It was really tough to look on the bright side.\"\n\nHaving dropped outside the coveted top 10 world rankings for the first time since January 2014, Halep was falling out of love with tennis.\n\nHowever, since she started working with Mouratoglou earlier this year Halep says her passion for the sport has been reignited.\n\n\"I didn't really expect that because I'm not very open to people and it's not easy for me to trust in somebody. But it was just a great connection since the first moment I met him,\" Halep says of Mouratoglou.\n\n\"I was almost done before coming here because I didn't have that fire anymore and I didn't trust that I'm able to play at the highest level again. So coming here I found it and I discovered again why I play tennis,\" she adds. \"I play tennis because I love it ... He brought that fire back.\"\n\nSimona Halep hits a backhand return to Iga Swiatek of Poland in their WTA semifinal match at the Indian Wells tennis tournament on March 18, 2022.\n\nNew beginnings\n\nIn April, Mouratoglou announced on social media that he would start coaching Halep full-time, after she visited his prestigious training academy in France ahead of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells , California.\n\n\"I always love to watch her play. I think she has an incredible game, so she's super exciting as a player,\" Mouratoglou tells CNN Sport. \"She was playing great already, but she could play much more. I could see the progress she could make.\"\n\nKnown by his moniker, \"The Coach,\" Mouratoglou is one of the most sought-after instructors in tennis.\n\nHe started coaching in 2005, working with Marcos Baghdatis on the junior circuit and helping him get to world No. 1 at youth level, according to his official website\n\nA year later Baghdatis got to the Australian Open final before losing to Roger Federer and also reached the Wimbledon semifinal that same season.\n\nSince then, Mouratoglou has helped an array of promising young players elevate their game, including Grigor Dimitrov, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and most notably 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams, the website adds\n\nThe secret to his success? \"Of course the passion is the most important. (If) the players don't have the passion, they're not going to achieve anything great,\" said Mouratolgou. \"So that's the key.\"\n\n\"People also in their life go through moments in which they kind of maybe lose their love for the game for a period of time or have less love for the game,\" he adds. \"I don't think she (Halep) lost it.\"\n\nWhat makes a champion\n\nTennis students train at the Mouratoglou Academy in Biot, southeastern France, on September 23, 2021.\n\nEven though Romania's Halep has 23 singles titles under her belt -- including two grand slam wins -- she had to adapt to an especially rigorous form of drilling at the Mouratoglou Academy\n\nShe spent two weeks starting a new training schedule at 8:30 a.m., something she told reporters she \"never did in my life,\" the WTA reported\n\n\"I did it with pleasure and I did it easy. So that made me think that I still love it and I still can do it. So if I'm healthy, I think I can have a good game,\" she added, according to the WTA website\n\nAlongside her physical rehabilitation, Halep has worked with Mouratoglou on rebuilding her confidence.\n\n\"He's super open, so it's super easy to talk to him,\" she tells CNN. \"I'm very emotional. I have many fears in general and I doubt myself most of the tim. And it was easy for me to actually express myself the way I am.\"\n\nWhen Mouratoglou appeared in the Netflix series, \"The Playbook,\" in September 2020, he spoke about how a player's mental strength can make or break their ability to become a champion.\n\nThe series follows world-renowned sports coaches as they share their personal rules for success both inside and outside the arena.\n\nSimona Halep shares a light hearted moments with coach Patrick Mouratoglou during preparation for Roland Garros on May 18, 2022 in Paris, France.\n\n\"Everyone has limits, and the limits of everyone are not technical, tactical, physical. They're mental,\" Mouratoglou told the documentary.\n\n\"And when you don't think like a champion, you don't act like a champion and don't win like a champion. So it's very important to make sure the mind works right.\"\n\nMouratoglou tells CNN that he has a similar approach to rebuilding a player's psychological resilience as legendary football manager José Mourinho , who also appeared in the Netflix series.\n\n\"He said something like, 'Soccer starts with the foot, continues with the heart and finishes with the head.'\"\n\n\"The head is the most important ... because if you don't deeply believe that you can achieve something, you're not going to go full. You're going to go halfway. You're going to find reasons not to do things. You're going to find excuses,\" Mouratoglou says.\n\n\"I think a big part of my job to help people, in this case Simona, believe in themselves and their ability to achieve what they want to,\" he adds. \"I always tell Simona how strong she is mentally because I really believe it.\n\n\"She made my job super easy, in a way, by being so open and trusting me so much.\"\n\nPartnership with Serena Williams\n\nMouratoglou is no stranger to reinventing players who have hit rock bottom.\n\nIn 2012 he approached a turning point in his career, when he started coaching Williams , who had just suffered an unprecedented defeat at Roland Garros to France's Virginie Razzano. It was the first time in Williams' career that she had lost in the first round of a major competition.\n\nSerena Williams training with coach Patrick Mouratoglou in preparation for the 2020 French Open at Roland Garros on September 26, 2020.\n\nShe was also in search of a grand slam victory, having gone for two years without winning a major.\n\nMouratoglou and Williams were dubbed the \"Dynamic Duo\" on tour and ended up tallying 10 grand slam victories together, as well as a women's singles title at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\n\"I'm super proud with what we've done with Serena. Now, of course, I'm super thankful for those 10 years that were incredible,\" Mouratoglou says. \"She's trusted me for 10 years, which is something that you don't see very often in the tennis world.\"\n\nWilliams has not played since she retired from her first-round Wimbledon match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich in June 2021, during which she sustained a leg injury.\n\n\"It's not easy to tell someone you worked with for 10 years that you're going to start something with someone else,\" Mouratoglou adds. \"It's a 10-year relationship ... where you share so many things and so many emotion and so many moments.\"\n\n'I'm ready to give my best'\n\nWhen Mouratoglou and Halep speak to CNN they're prepping for Roland Garros, where the 30-year-old Romanian is scheduled to play against Croatia's Ana Konjuh in the first round on Sunday.\n\nHalep has fond memories of the French Open, having won her maiden grand slam title in Paris after beating Sloane Stephens in 2018.\n\n\"The French Open is my favorite grand slam,\" she says. \"I love the city. I feel great. I like the vibe. So everything gets together and I just feel great. It's going to be a big challenge, this tournament, for me. I'm ready mentally. I'm ready to give my best.\"\n\n\"I really thought I would be done by 30,\" Halep says. \"I was wrong.\"\n\n\"I want to play few more years. I feel like I can,\" she adds. \"My body is okay. You know, I feel healthy. I feel that my energy level is high. So I don't see any reason to stop now.\"\n\nSimona Halep hugs the trophy as she celebrates victory following the ladies singles final against Sloane Stephens at the French Open final on June 9, 2018 in Paris, France.\n\nHowever, there's one player who could stand in the way of a third grand slam tittle for Halep.\n\nPoland's Iga Swiatek has had a meteoric rise to become world No. 1 over the past year.\n\nIn April, she clinched her fourth straight title of the 2022 season at the Stuttgart Open final , pushing her winning streak to 23 matches.\n\nAt just 20 years old, Swiatek has shown no sign of wavering. If she wins the French Open, she'll equal Venus Williams' record this millennium of 35 successive victories.\n\n\"For the last month, Iga has shown a lot of stability physically, mentally and tennis wise. She's super solid in everything. That's why she's been winning so much. But I think everybody is beatable,\" Mouratoglou says.\n\nAnd Mouratoglou is confident that Halep's mental fortitude could rival Swiatek.\n\n\"She's also a great player, but what makes her special is the fact that she's extremely strong mentally,\" he says. \"I feel that also she believes in herself and the combination can do wonders.\"", "authors": ["Christina Macfarlane", "Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/05/21"}]}

She was 73.\n\n\"Dame Olivia Newton-John passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time,\" her husband, John Easterling, wrote in a statement on the singer's verified Instagram account. \"Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.\"\n\nThe singer revealed in September 2018 that she was treating cancer at the base of her spine. It was her third cancer diagnosis, following bouts with breast cancer in the early '90s and in 2017.\n\nHer rise to fame\n\nThanks to a string of country and soft-rock hits, Newton-John was already a popular singer by the late 1970s. But her co-starring role opposite John Travolta in 1978's \"Grease,\" arguably the most popular movie musical of all time, lifted her to a new level of stardom.\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Travolta in 1978 in 'Grease.'\n\nAlthough she had little acting experience (and turned 29 during filming), Newton-John gave an indelible performance as Sandy, a sweet-natured Australian transfer student who romances Travolta's alpha greaser Danny at a Southern California high school in the 1950s.\n\nTheir onscreen chemistry as mismatched lovebirds who undergo final-act makeovers to win each others' hearts -- she ditches her frilly dresses for heels, leather, spandex and a cigarette -- anchored the movie and inspired repeat viewings by legions of fans.\n\n\"I don't think anyone could have imagined a movie would go on almost 40 years and would still be popular and people would still be talking to me about it all the time and loving it,\" Newton-John told CNN in 2017 . \"It's just one of those movies. I'm very lucky to have been a part of it. It's given so many people pleasure.\"\n\nNewton-John sang on three of the movie's biggest hits: the duets \"You're The One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights\" with Travolta, and her swoony solo ballad, \"Hopelessly Devoted To You.\"\n\nBorn in Cambridge, England in 1948, Newton-John moved with her family to Melbourne, Australia , when she was five. After winning a talent contest on a TV show, \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" as a teen she formed an all-girl group and began appearing on weekly pop music programs in Australia.\n\nNewton-John recorded her first single in England in 1966 and scored a few international hits, but she remained largely unknown to US audiences until 1973, when \"Let Me Be There\" became a top-10 hit on both the adult contemporary and the country charts.\n\nA series of No. 1 easy-listening hits followed, including \"I Honestly Love You,\" \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" and \"Please Mr. Please.\"\n\nThen came \"Grease,\" which was 1978's top-grossing movie and became an enduring cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe movie gave Newton-John an opportunity to change her squeaky-clean image. The cover of her next album, \"Totally Hot,\" featured the singer in black leather, while its songs had an edgier, more contemporary pop sound.\n\nHer singing success\n\nIn 1981, she took her new, sexier persona a step further with \"Physical,\" a dance number with such suggestive lyrics as, \"There's nothing left to talk about unless it's horizontally.\" Banned by several radio stations, it became her biggest hit, spending 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOlivia Newton-John performing on the BBC TV music show 'Top Of The Pops' in 1974.\n\nShe also appeared in several more big-budget movies, including the musical fantasy \"Xanadu\" with Hollywood legend Gene Kelly in his final screen role. The film bombed, but its soundtrack sold well and spawned \"Magic,\" a No. 1 hit.\n\nIn 1983 she teamed with Travolta again for \"Two of a Kind,\" a romantic comedy-fantasy, but it failed to recapture their \"Grease\" spark.\n\nOver a lengthy career Newton-John won four Grammy Awards and sold more than 100 million albums.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Australian pop star Olivia Newton-John's life in pictures Olivia Newton-John waves goodbye in the 1978 movie \"Grease.\" Hide Caption 1 of 29 Photos: Photos: Australian pop star Olivia Newton-John's life in pictures A young Newton-John is seen in front here with her father, Brin; her brother, Hugh; her mother, Irene; and her sister, Rona.

As the year nears its close, here is a reminder of some of the well-known people who died in 2021. Larry King – 23 January A legend of US broadcasting and the king of the talk show, Larry King died aged 87 on 23 January. Over five decades, he interviewed some 50,000 people, from presidents and movie stars to death row inmates. Sporting his trademark braces over a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, he presented himself as an old-school news man, said The Times – but he described himself as an “infotainer”. He wanted, he said, to ask the kind of questions a curious member of the public would ask. In 1985, the cable channel CNN offered King his own nightly TV show, Larry King Live. It ran for 25 years. “Every day of my life is a learning experience, and I’m fascinated by everything,” he said in 2014. “My curiosity in all those years has never dimmed since I was a little kid.” Cicely Tyson – 28 January Cicely Tyson was a pioneering black actress whose seven-decade-long career encompassed film, theatre and television. Refusing to take any role that she felt demeaned black people, even if that meant not working, she won three Emmys, a Tony, an honorary Oscar and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and she was cited as an inspiration by countless younger actors. Tyson took the lead role in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, a hit TV drama from 1974 about the life of a 100-year-old woman who was born into slavery, and played the mother of Kunta Kinte in the seminal TV miniseries Roots, in 1977. Skip advert Later, she played Sipsey in the film Fried Green Tomatoes (1991), she had a recurring role as a congresswoman in Netflix’s House of Cards and, from 2015, she was Viola Davis’s mother in the TV show How to Get Away with Murder. In 2018, she won an honorary Oscar – the first black woman to do so. Dustin Diamond – 1 February Dustin Diamond, best known for playing Samuel “Screech” Powers in the US sitcom Saved by the Bell, died aged 44, just three weeks after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nDiamond portrayed Screech for the show’s entire run, from 1989 to 1992, as it developed what Johnny Diaz in The New York Times described as a “cult following among millennials and members of Generation X and grew into an internet obsession for some fans”. When the series ended, Diamond reprised the character for various spin-off shows and appeared on reality TV, but spoke openly about the difficulty he had in finding work. Captain Tom Moore – 2 February Captain Tom Moore received international attention and a knighthood when he raised more than £32m for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday. He said he began raising funds to thank the “magnificent” NHS staff who treated him for cancer and a broken hip. Moore died at the age of 100 after testing positive for Covid-19. The Queen and Boris Johnson paid tribute to the Army veteran, with the prime minister describing him as a “hero in the truest sense of the word”. Christopher Plummer – 5 February Christopher Plummer was a “tremendous” Canadian actor, with “an imposing physique, a broad brow, sculpted features and a magnificent voice”, who is “destined, or doomed” to be primarily remembered for his role as Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965), said Michael Coveney in The Guardian. Appearing on “stage, screen and Alpine meadow” for more than six decades, he played all the great Shakespearean roles, outlived his fellow hellraisers to become a “go-to” actor for senior star roles, and, aged 82, became the oldest actor ever to win an Oscar. Mary Wilson – 8 February As a 15-year-old living in a housing project in Detroit, Mary Wilson co-founded one of the most successful (and glamorous) singing groups of the 1960s. She remained with The Supremes until the Motown hit machine was finally dissolved in 1977 – having weathered numerous feuds, and the departure of both her co-founders, Florence Ballard and Diana Ross. Skip advert In total, The Supremes had 12 Billboard No. 1 hits in the US – a record unsurpassed for a female vocal group – and they rivalled The Beatles for commercial success. Thanks to TV, Wilson said, “people were able to see us all over America and see black people in a different light”. Wilson’s first solo album didn’t sell well, and she was dropped by Motown in 1980. But she continued to perform. She also wrote four memoirs, one of which was a runaway bestseller, and worked as an activist, campaigning successfully for better trademark protection for musicians. Bunny Wailer – 2 March Bunny Wailer, whose real name was Neville Livingston, was the last surviving founder member of The Wailers – the group that propelled Bob Marley to superstardom, and helped popularise reggae worldwide.\n\nThe Wailers were described as the Jamaican Beatles and, like the Fab Four, they had distinct identities and pursued solo careers. Wailer’s debut solo album, Blackheart Man (1976), is “widely felt to be one of reggae’s highest peaks”, said The Guardian. A devout Rastafarian, Wailer, who died aged 73, lived on a farm outside Kingston he’d bought with his settlement from Island Records, where he grew food and smoked herb. Paul Ritter – 5 April Paul Ritter, who died of a brain tumour at the age of 54, is “destined” to be remembered for playing the eccentric yet lovable dad on the Channel 4 series Friday Night Dinner. “And rightly so,” said Stuart Heritage in The Guardian. “That role… brought Ritter a level of fame he had previously never achieved.” Before Friday Night Dinner, Ritter had appeared in big hits including Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Vera and the critically acclaimed Chernobyl. He was also a talented stage actor, nominated for both Tony and Olivier awards. Writing for The Herald, Neil Cooper described Ritter as “a quietly brilliant character actor who had the ability to inhabit each new role to the point of being unrecognisable”. Prince Philip – 9 April Prince Philip, the Queen’s husband and closest confidant for 73 years, died on 9 April aged 99 at Windsor Castle. Described by Queen Elizabeth II in her golden wedding speech as “my strength and stay all these years”, the Duke of Edinburgh retired from public duties in August 2017, having completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Skip advert The death of Prince Philip, just two months short of his 100th birthday, prompted a flood of tributes from world leaders and members of his family. His grandson, Prince William, called him an “extraordinary man” from “an extraordinary generation”, who would want him to “get on with the job”. And Prince Harry described his grandfather as “master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right till the end”. DMX – 9 April The rapper DMX died aged 50 after being hospitalised by a heart attack, with his family calling him “a warrior who fought till the very end”. “He loved his family with all of his heart, and we cherish the times we spent with him,\" they added. DMX, whose real name was Earl Simmons, had five US No. 1 albums, featuring iconic songs such as Party Up (Up in Here), What’s My Name? and X Gon’ Give It to Ya.\n\nHis music was often “menacing and dark”, but it was “infused with Christian spirituality”, said Daniel E. Slotnik in The New York Times. It was also informed by his “long struggle with drugs, his bleak childhood”, with many of his “most swaggering songs” containing “hints of lingering trauma”. Nikki Grahame – 9 April Former Big Brother contestant Nikki Grahame, who was particularly well known for her diary room tantrums, died at the age of 38 after being hospitalised with an eating disorder. Davina McCall, the former presenter of the show, said she was “so desperately sad” to hear of the death of “the funniest, most bubbly sweetest girl”. Speaking to The Guardian last year, Grahame said she had “fond memories” of the show, “even though there were times where it looked like I was having a meltdown”. Big Brother gave her “a lot” financially, she said. “I bought the flat I live in now. I’ve never had to get a ‘normal’ job; I’ve always had something to fall back on… I’ve been very lucky. Overall, it has had a positive effect on my life.” Helen McCrory – 16 April One of Britain’s finest actors, Helen McCrory, who died of breast cancer aged 52, was only 5ft 3in tall yet such was the energy she brought to her performances, she could command London’s biggest stages, said The Daily Telegraph. Skip advert McCrory made her professional debut in 1990 – and thereafter worked more or less continuously. By the 2000s, critics had started referring to her as “the next Judi Dench”. In 2006, she played Cherie Blair in Stephen Frears’s film The Queen, which kick-started her screen career. She was in three of the Harry Potter films and appeared in a huge range of TV roles. She was a scene-stealing presence in all five series of Peaky Blinders, playing Aunt Polly, the terrifying matriarch of the gangster clan. Una Stubbs – 12 August Una Stubbs, who died aged 84, was an enormously versatile actress, and a familiar face on British television for several decades, said The Daily Telegraph. Although best known for her sparkling, mischievous and sometimes kooky performances in comedy roles, she starred in everything from pantomime and musicals to serious theatre. From 1979 she cemented her place in popular television culture with her role as the prim Aunt Sally in the much-loved ITV adaptation of Worzel Gummidge. Around the same time, she began her long stint as captain of the women’s team on the charades-based panel show Give Us a Clue, with Lionel Blair, who also died this year.\n\nMeanwhile, she continued to pop up on TV, ending her career on a high with her role as the “touchingly concerned” Mrs Hudson in Sherlock, with Benedict Cumberbatch (whom she had known since he was four). Sean Lock – 18 August The stand-up comedian, actor and team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats died from cancer at the age of 58. “Bespectacled, besuited and well-groomed”, Lock “projected a constant air of puzzlement as he imparted his deadpan observational humour”, said Anthony Hayward in The Guardian. Lock won the British Comedy Award for Best Live Comic in 2000, but it wasn’t until 2005 that he found fame in the comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats. He toured widely as a stand-up while recording episodes of the hit Channel 4 show. According to Marcus Williamson in The Independent, when asked by Jimmy Carr what he’d like his obituary to say, he quipped: “I don’t care, I’ll be dead. But ideally I’d like it to say, nooooooo, whyyyyyy, nooooooo, aaaahhh, you can’t write tears, Jimmy…” Charlie Watts – 24 August Perhaps the most reluctant rock star to emerge from the 1960s, drummer Charlie Watts, who died aged 80, was certainly the most “mild-mannered member of the Rolling Stones”, said The Times. However, the paper added, his “phlegmatic presence was a vital ingredient in the Stones’ often volatile chemistry”. Skip advert A dapper, unassuming man whose abiding love was jazz, he was happier in a well-cut suit than in a leather jacket or kaftan. And when Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were being chased by screaming fans, busted for drugs and pilloried by politicians, Watts was quietly getting on with his drumming, maintaining a zen-like focus during their concerts. “Watts was the Stone who never rolled,” said The Daily Telegraph, yet he was the “linchpin” of the band – by far “the most respected by musicians and popular with the fans”. Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry – 29 August Lee “Scratch” Perry was an eccentric Jamaican record producer who “revelled in disorder”, said The Daily Telegraph. In his tiny Black Ark studio in Kingston, he would whirl like a dervish around his mixing desk, dressed in shorts and a singlet, often barefoot – and almost always stoned. Yet the sounds he created, as a pioneer of both roots reggae and dub, reverberated around the world. The success of the two albums he made with The Wailers – Soul Rebels (1970) and Soul Revolution (1971) – brought other acts flocking to him.\n\nFrom his studio, which he built in 1973, he produced a string of classic songs and albums, many of which had political themes, including Max Romeo’s War Ina Babylon, and Junior Murvin’s Police and Thieves. The latter was covered by The Clash, and in 1977 Perry produced their single Complete Control. Sarah Harding – 5 September In 2002, thousands of young hopefuls auditioned for the ITV reality show Popstars: The Rivals. But when Sarah Harding appeared in front of the judges in August that year, it took them no time to see her potential. Four months later, viewers voted the 20-year-old into the newly created girl band Girls Aloud. They superseded the Spice Girls by having “a record-breaking run of 20 consecutive top ten singles”, said The Times, four of which reached No. 1. Six of their albums went platinum. In August 2020, Harding revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. “Nothing is certain any more,” she told The Times. “I’m just grateful to wake up every day and live my best life, because now I know just how precious it is.” Michael K. Williams – 6 September Michael K. Williams, who died aged 54, broke into acting when the rapper Tupac Shakur chose him – on the strength of a Polaroid picture – to play his brother in the 1996 thriller Bullet, said The Guardian. It led to other roles, but it was The Wire, from 2002, that made him famous. Skip advert Appearing as the terrifying, shotgun-wielding stick-up artist Omar Little, he brilliantly conveyed that character’s menacing charisma, as well as his peculiar tenderness. President Obama described The Wire as the best show on television, and Omar as his favourite character in it. Williams also played dapper bootlegger Chalky White in Boardwalk Empire for five years from 2010, and more recently had starred in Lovecraft Country. He also won an Emmy nomination for a documentary he produced on the failings of America’s youth justice system. Willie Garson – 21 September Willie Garson was the actor best known for playing talent agent Stanford Blatch, Carrie Bradshaw’s male best friend, in the iconic TV show Sex and the City. A New York Times obituary written by his loved ones described the 57-year-old’s role over six seasons of the show as “not only hilarious, but also vulnerable at times, as he struggled in his own efforts to navigate sex and the city”. Over the last four decades, Garson appeared in more than 300 television shows and 70 films, the obituary added. His most notable film credits included There’s Something About Mary, Groundhog Day, Being John Malkovich and Freaky Friday. James Michael Tyler – 24 October The actor best known for his role as Gunther, manager of the Central Perk coffee shop in the NBC sitcom Friends, died aged 59. He had started as an extra on the show, given the role because he could work the coffee machine.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2016/05/24/wahlberg-cheech-epps-kardashian-hasselhoff-nicholson-gable-indianapolis-speedway/84507360/", "title": "Indy 500: Ranking top 33 celebs who attended 99 races", "text": "IndyStar\n\nIt’s not easy to entice stars of stage and screen to come to Indianapolis to simply hang out, but the Greatest Spectacle in Racing has been doing it for decades.\n\nCelebrities from both coasts began flocking to the landlocked excitement of the Indianapolis 500 after World War II, and they arrived in organized fashion once the 500 Festival Parade debuted in 1957.\n\nBefore the war, the Indy 500 had captured Hollywood’s attention, when movies such as 1929’s “Speedway” and 1932’s “The Crowd Roars” were made, but there wasn’t much fuss about whether leading men or starlets showed up on Race Day.\n\nAnd nobody’s accusing the 500 of consistently attracting A-list visitors. This IndyStar headline from 1979 reflects the challenge of luring heavy hitters: “500 Festival parade loses one celebrity but gains Vic Tayback.”\n\nOn drums, Will Power assists in driving Indy 500 buzz\n\nIf you need a refresher, Tayback portrayed diner owner Mel on the sitcom “Alice.” The celebrity who couldn’t make it? Adam Rich, pre-teen star of “Eight is Enough.”\n\nNevertheless, some of the biggest names in entertainment have attended the first 99 runnings of the Indianapolis 500.\n\nWe've assembled an Indy 500-style starting grid of 33 visiting celebrities through the years. The lineup doesn’t include Jim Nabors and Florence Henderson, who became fixtures of pre-race festivities, or full-time Indiana residents John Mellencamp and John Green. And we’re keeping politicians out of it (be advised that presidents Ford, Bush 41 and Clinton all were here).\n\nA subjective ranking of the top 33 celebrities — counting down to our pole-sitter — who attended at least one 500:\n\nRow 11\n\n33. Kim Kardashian\n\nPlace Kim Kardashian 50 years in the past or 50 years in the future, and she’s not a safe bet to make this list. Today, she’s a perfect fit in an age of reality TV, selfies and in-app purchases. When Kardashian attended the 2010 race, she promoted diet regimen QuickTrim with sister Kourtney, mother Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner, known then as her stepfather, Bruce.\n\n32. David Hasselhoff\n\nWhen David Hasselhoff sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before the 1986 race, he had wrapped four seasons as the star of \"Knight Rider\" and his next phase of stardom with \"Baywatch\" was three years in the future. Although a 2007 home video showed an apparently intoxicated Hasselhoff struggling to eat a hamburger, he has repaired his reputation enough to earn a role in a 2017 \"Baywatch\" film starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. As far as we know, Hasselhoff's popularity in Germany endures.\n\n31. Jayne Mansfield\n\nMarilyn Monroe never made it to the Indianapolis 500, but fellow pin-up icon Jayne Mansfield attended multiple editions of the race. Mansfield, winner of a Golden Globe award as female new star of the year in 1957, starred in 1956 rock 'n' roll film \"The Girl Can't Help It.\" Famous for plunging necklines in her heyday, she is now known as the mother of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" star Mariska Hargitay. Mansfield died in a car crash in 1967.\n\nCelebrities in 500 Festival events\n\nRow 10\n\n30. Ice-T\n\nHip-hop royalty came to Indianapolis Motor Speedway when Ice-T attended the 2014 Indy 500. Accompanied by his wife and reality-TV co-star, Coco Austin, Ice-T cheered for driver Marco Andretti. \"Recently, our dog, King Maximus, had puppies,\" the rapper-actor said on the red carpet. \"Marco has one of the puppies, Moody. We're related by dog.\" \"Colors\" and \"O.G. Original Gangster\" rank among Ice-T's signature songs. His acting resume includes \"New Jack City\" and \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\n\n29. Slash\n\nIf Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin, the native Hoosiers in rock band Guns N' Roses, ever attended the Indianapolis 500, they were low-key visitors to the track. Slash, known for signature GNR guitar riffs in \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" and \"Paradise City,\" took a high-profile path to the race. He rode in the 500 Festival Parade and attended the Snakepit Ball in 2008. Slash wasn't a member of Guns N' Roses at the time, but he reunited with Rose this year for a string of stadium shows. Stradlin chose not to return to the band's lineup.\n\n28. Patricia Heaton\n\nThis lead actress in two popular sitcoms, \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and Indiana-set \"The Middle,\" served as grand marshal for the 500 Festival Parade in 2008. Patricia Heaton had a rooting interest in that year's race because her FourBoy Films company was a secondary sponsor of Sarah Fisher's car. A collision forced Fisher out of the race after 103 laps.\n\nRow 9\n\n27. Mike Epps\n\nThe 2013 race served as a homecoming for this comedic actor who grew up in Indianapolis. Mike Epps was a hit on the red carpet and on the starting grid, where people gravitated to the actor who portrayed Day-Day in \"Next Friday\" and Black Doug in \"The Hangover.\" Epps stars in ABC's sitcom adaptation of \"Uncle Buck\" this summer, and director Lee Daniels hired Epps to portray Richard Pryor in an upcoming film.\n\n26. Marlee Matlin\n\nThis is the 30th-anniversary year for \"Children of a Lesser God,\" the film that earned Marlee Matlin a best-actress Oscar at age 21. Matlin, also known for guest performances on \"Seinfeld\" (\"The Lip Reader\") and \"The West Wing,\" attended the Indianapolis 500 in 2008. She has recently been seen on cable-TV drama \"Switched at Birth\" and on Broadway with \"Spring Awakening.\"\n\n25. Cheech Marin\n\nOne-half of 1970s comedy duo Cheech & Chong attended the 500 and enjoyed a two-seat ride at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2005. Cheech Marin acted with Don Johnson in TV series \"Nash Bridges\" and with Kevin Costner in the film \"Tin Cup.\" Marin's voice-over career includes roles in \"The Lion King\" and \"Cars.\"\n\nRow 8\n\n24. Olivia Newton-John\n\nThis four-time Grammy Award winner served as grand marshal for the 500 Festival Parade. Olivia Newton-John paid close attention to the Indy Lights Freedom 100, a Carb Day race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, because her nephew Emerson Newton-John was part of the field. An early-race collision sealed Emerson's 17th-place finish. Olivia, known for songs ranging from \"Physical\" to \"I Honestly Love You,\" portrayed Sandy Olsson in smash 1978 film \"Grease.\"\n\n23. Patrick Dempsey\n\nIn Indianapolis 500 history, Patrick Dempsey has the rare distinction of executing two different pre-race tasks. The actor known for portraying Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd across 11 seasons of \"Grey's Anatomy\" drove the pace car in 2007 and waved the green flag in 2015. Dempsey's auto-racing resume includes his co-ownership of the Vision Racing team, an Indianapolis 500 competitor from 2005 to 2010, as well as being a driver himself in five editions of France's 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\n22. Ashley Judd\n\nEasy to spot but difficult to see, Ashley Judd wore floppy hats and sunglasses around Indianapolis Motor Speedway for more than a decade. She watched from the pits when her then-husband, Dario Franchitti, won the Indy 500 in 2007, 2010 and 2012. Onscreen, Judd found stardom in thriller films such as \"Kiss the Girls,\" \"Double Jeopardy\" and \"High Crimes.\" In 2004, she portrayed the wife of Indiana songwriting icon Cole Porter in \"De-Lovely\" opposite Kevin Kline. Franchitti and Judd ended their marriage in 2013.\n\nRow 7\n\n21. Shirley MacLaine\n\nWith roles spanning 1960's \"The Apartment\" to modern TV series \"Downton Abbey,\" Shirley MacLaine was an emerging star when she came to Indianapolis Motor Speedway to present the Borg-Warner Trophy to the Indy 500 winner in 1958. In the tradition of the time, MacLaine kissed the winner, Jimmy Bryan, in Victory Lane. According to IndyStar reports, she kissed Bryan twice and asked for a third. He replied, \"Certainly, if you don't mind getting your face dirty. I like it.\" MacLaine won a best-actress Academy Award for 1983 film \"Terms of Endearment\" and an Emmy Award for a 1976 variety-show special titled \"Gypsy in My Soul.\"\n\n20. Tim Allen\n\nIn 2001, Tim Allen mingled with members of pit crews before the Indianapolis 500. \"I've been an Indy 500 fan and an Indiana fan for a long, long time,\" he said. \"But today I'm here to cheer on my friend Michael Andretti.\" The race marked Andretti's return to Indianapolis Motor Speedway after five years away because of the feuding Indy Racing League and CART series. He finished third. Allen starred in \"Home Improvement\" from 1991 to 1999, and he is heading into his sixth season of ABC sitcom \"Last Man Standing.\" He also is known as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in three \"Toy Story\" films.\n\n19. Ron Howard\n\nAs a 22-year-old, \"Happy Days\" star Ron Howard attended the Indianapolis 500 in 1976. This era in Howard's career came after his boyhood role on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and before he directed the films \"Splash,\" \"Apollo 13,\" \"Cocoon\" and \"A Beautiful Mind.\" In 2012, he returned to the track to drive the pace car for that year's NASCAR race and to generate buzz for \"Rush,\" his 2013 film based on 1970s Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda.\n\nRow 6\n\n18. Carol Burnett\n\nThis comedic icon was one of many celebrities who came to the Indianapolis 500 because former team owner Andy Granatelli hosted them here. Burnett, winner of 23 Emmy Awards and a Kennedy Center Honors recipient, attended the race in 2005. Granatelli, the outsized personality known for promoting STP automotive additives, died in 2013 at age 90. Burnett presently tours with a Q&A show titled \"Laughter and Reflection With Carol Burnett.\"\n\n17. Russell Crowe\n\nIn one of the luckier celebrity breaks for the Indianapolis 500, Russell Crowe made a spur-of-the-moment decision to stop by in 2005. At the time, the best-actor Oscar winner for 2000 film \"Gladiator\" was zipping around the United States to promote the film \"Cinderella Man.\" \"I heard about this race in Indianapolis,\" said Crowe, who grew up in Australia. Also known for his work in \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"L.A. Confidential,\" Crowe has a new movie, \"The Nice Guys,\" in theaters. If he wanted to push that comedy at the 100th running, he would surely be welcome at the track.\n\n16. Steven Tyler\n\nThis Rock and Roll Hall of Famer generated large amounts of ire when he modified the final line of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Indianapolis 500 one day before Memorial Day in 2001. By singing \"the home of the Indianapolis 500\" rather than \"the home of the brave,\" Steven Tyler sparked a negative reaction that led to apologies from himself and Tony George, the track president at the time. \"While we are certainly sorry that some were offended, it was neither our intention nor that of Mr. Tyler to be disrespectful,\" George said in a statement. Aside from the performance's controversy, Tyler's band, Aerosmith, sponsored the car driven by Jeff Ward in the race. Ward finished 24th.\n\nRow 5\n\n15. Jay Leno\n\nThe host of \"The Tonight Show\" for more than 20 years attended multiple races in the 1990s, and he drove the Indianapolis 500 pace car in 1999. \"To me, race car drivers like Mario Andretti, Phil Hill and Dan Gurney are just as much athletes as Michael Jordan or Mickey Mantle or whoever,\" Leno told The Los Angeles Daily News in 1999. \"It's just a different kind of sport.\" Since exiting \"The Tonight Show\" in 2014, Leno has hosted the car-themed \"Jay Leno's Garage\" on cable network CNBC.\n\n14. Mark Wahlberg\n\nActor Mark Wahlberg made history in 2010 by being the first celebrity to ride in the \"Fastest Seat in Sports\" at the Indianapolis 500. The \"Fastest Seat\" promotion features Mario Andretti and a passenger on track in a two-seat open-wheel car. This year's passenger is musician Keith Urban. Wahlberg, star of \"The Departed,\" \"Ted\" and \"Boogie Nights,\" offered this reaction after his \"Fastest Seat\" ride: \"So much speed. I don't know how you survive an accident.\"\n\n13. James Garner\n\nThis star of two popular TV series, \"Maverick\" (1957-1962) and \"The Rockford Files\" (1974 to 1980), was a familiar face at Indianapolis Motor Speedway across five decades. In an official capacity, James Garner drove the pace car at the Indy 500 in 1975, 1977 and 1985. The auto-racing enthusiast starred in 1966 film \"Grand Prix,\" and his filmography included roles in \"The Great Escape\" and \"The Notebook.\" Garner died in 2014 at age 86.\n\nRow 4\n\n12. Michael Douglas\n\nThis two-time Academy Award winner checked out the 2000 race as a guest of Andy Granatelli. Michael Douglas expressed his love of Formula One racing to reporters and said he planned to come back to Indianapolis Motor Speedway for that year's Indianapolis Grand Prix (the first of eight F1 events presented at the track). After an early-career stint on TV's \"The Streets of San Francisco,\" Douglas starred in blockbuster films \"Wall Street,\" \"Fatal Attraction\" and \"Basic Instinct.\"\n\n11. Gene Hackman\n\nThis two-time Academy Award winner co-sponsored the car driven by Dennis Firestone in the 1983 Indianapolis 500. Firestone finished 24th. Two years later, Gene Hackman began his journey into Indiana lore by coming here to make the film \"Hoosiers.\" As a thrill-seeker behind the wheel, Hackman drove for portions of the epic car chase seen in 1971's \"The French Connection,\" and he competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1983. The 86-year-old also is known for his roles in \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" \"The Unforgiven\" and \"Mississippi Burning.\"\n\n10. David Letterman\n\nMemorial Day weekend always brings David Letterman to his hometown for the 500-Mile Race. As a team co-owner, Letterman enjoyed the peak experience of winning the Indy 500 when Buddy Rice finished first in 2004. This year, the Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing entrants are Graham Rahal and rookie Spencer Pigot. In 2015, Letterman attended the race four days into his retirement from 33 years and more than 6,000 episodes of late-night talk. In 1971, he made a short appearance on a national broadcast of the race when he interviewed Mario Andretti following an accident in Turn 3.\n\nRow 3\n\n9. Amelia Earhart\n\nThis famed aviator warranted first-name headline status in The Indianapolis Star when she came to town in 1935: \"Amelia to earn another 'first' today.\" Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, served as honorary referee for the Indianapolis 500. Also in 1935, Purdue University hired Earhart to counsel young women about career opportunities in engineering. The school picked up part of the tab for the Lockheed Electra plane she flew on her final attempt to set another record. On July 2, 1937, Earhart and her navigator disappeared above the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to fly around the world.\n\n8. Walter Cronkite\n\n\"The most trusted man in America\" served as grand marshal of the 500 Festival Parade in 1966. According to Indianapolis Motor Speedway historian Donald Davidson, CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite attended many editions of the Indianapolis 500. \"Usually he was the guest of team owner Lindsey Hopkins,\" Davidson told The New York Times following Cronkite's death in 2009 at age 92. \"Not many people know that in the 1950s Cronkite was an aspiring race driver and was apparently quite talented.” Eventually, however, he had to choose one vocation or the other. “His bosses told him that if he wanted to go anyplace in the news business, he had to give up racing,\" Davidson said.\n\n7. Morgan Freeman\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway invited Morgan Freeman to drive the pace car at the 2003 Indy 500, but the actor declined because of scheduling conflicts. When the track asked again in 2004, Freeman gave an emphatic \"yes.\" \"My life is a series of dreams coming true,\" Freeman told Motorsport.com. \"This will largely be another one. I will put it on my wall of successes.\" Known for his roles in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Seven,\" \"Driving Miss Daisy\" and \"Bruce Almighty,\" Freeman won a supporting-actor Academy Award for his work in 2004 film \"Million Dollar Baby.\"\n\nRow 2\n\n6. Bob Hope\n\nBob Hope worked at Indianapolis Motor Speedway when the drivers didn't. On May 30, 1945, he and partner Bing Crosby starred at a comedy and golf event at the track to benefit a World War II veterans' rehabilitation fund. Because of the war, the Indianapolis 500 was called off from 1942 through 1945. Hope, a master of vaudeville, radio, television and film, served as grand marshal for the 500 Festival Parade in 1976. He turned 73 on May 29, 1976, and he played a USO benefit at the Indiana Convention Center billed as the \"Bob Hope Birthday Party and Show.\" Hope died in 2003 at age 100.\n\n5. Jimmy Stewart\n\nIndianapolis residents were surprised to see an unshaven Jimmy Stewart when he arrived to serve as grand marshal of the 500 Festival Parade in 1965. “It isn’t that I’ve been using the wrong razor,” he told IndyStar. “I’ve got eight days of growth for a movie we’re making out near Yuma, Ariz.\" The film was \"The Flight of the Phoenix,\" a plane-crash story set in the desert. Stewart is better known for \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"Vertigo\" and \"Rear Window.\" He won a best-actor Oscar for 1940's \"The Philadelphia Story.\" Stewart, who died in 1997 at age 89, made his debut as a leading man in 1936's \"Speed,\" an auto-racing tale that incorporated footage from the Indianapolis 500.\n\n4. Muhammad Ali\n\nAccording to an IndyStar report, all commotion in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway VIP green room halted when boxing great Muhammad Ali arrived in 2003. Selected as \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated, Ali regaled fellow celebrities with a few magic tricks before stepping outside to pose for photos, throw fake punches and sign autographs. Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, Ali rode in a Corvette convertible parade car before the 2003 race.\n\nRow 1\n\n3. Jack Nicholson\n\nThree-time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson enjoyed his role as honorary starter of the 2010 Indianapolis 500 so much that he didn't hand off the green flag until after the race's second restart. That added up to three waves for the price of one for Nicholson, who arrived at the track wearing a Los Angeles Lakers hat and a Hawaiian-style shirt. While perched above the start-finish line before the race, the star of \"The Shining,\" \"Chinatown,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"As Good As It Gets\" applauded soldiers as they marched by, pointed at fans, posed for photos and blew a kiss to Ashley Judd, IndyStar reported.\n\n2. Clark Gable\n\nThe man immortalized as \"Gone with the Wind's\" Rhett Butler attended the 1947 race with minimum fanfare and returned in 1950 to make the film \"To Please a Lady\" at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. When a reporter asked Clark Gable if he planned to \"turn a lap\" on the track, he replied, \"It won’t be a very fast one. Competition around here is too tough.\" A best-actor Oscar winner for 1934's \"It Happened One Night,\" Gable died in 1960 at age 59.\n\n1. Paul Newman\n\nThe steady star of \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"Hud,\" \"The Hustler\" and \"Slapshot\" lands at the top of our list as someone who loved auto racing as much as he cared about his Hollywood day job. Paul Newman's connection to Indianapolis Motor Speedway dates to 1968, when he made the film \"Winning\" at the track. He collected an Academy Award for 1986's \"The Color of Money,\" a movie released three years after he started a racing team with industry entrepreneur Carl Haas. Their team won eight season championships in the CART and Champ Car World Series leagues, but an Indy 500 victory eluded Newman. As a driver, he won four Sports Car Club of America regional championships and two Trans Am Series professional races. Newman, who called Indianapolis Motor Speedway \"the greatest race course in the world,\" died in 2008 at age 83.\n\nCall Star reporter David Lindquist at (317) 444-6404.

This just breaks my heart. Ronnie's music and spirit will live forever.\"\n\nJoan Jett said Spector's \"mark on rock and roll is indelible.\"\n\nBorn Veronica Bennett in the Spanish Harlem neighborhood of New York City, she formed the Ronettes in 1961 with an older sister and a cousin while she was still a teenager.\n\nThe group didn't become famous until after they auditioned two years later for music producer Phil Spector, creator of the 1960s' \"Wall of Sound\" style, who signed them to his label.\n\nFueled by the runaway success of \"Be My Baby,\" their first single for Spector, they toured the country with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars and reeled off a string of pop hits over the next several years, including \"Baby I Love You,\" \"Walking in the Rain\" and \"Do I Love You?\"\n\nThe girl group also became hugely popular in England, where the Ronettes headlined over acts such as the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton and The Yardbirds, according to Ronnie Spector's website , and later opened for the Beatles on their final US tour in 1966.\n\nThe group broke up in 1967. Soon after Ronnie wed Phil Spector, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship. The couple divorced in 1974.\n\nIn her memoir, \"Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness,\" Ronnie Spector described her husband as controlling and emotionally abusive.\n\nIn social media posts after his death last year, she famously said , \"he was a brilliant producer, but a lousy husband.\"\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Ronnie Spector had launched a new career as a solo artist. Although she never again reached the commercial peak of her '60s heyday, she returned to Top 40 radio singing with Eddie Money on his 1986 hit, \"Take Me Home Tonight.\"\n\nIn 1988, Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes sued Phil Spector for more than $10 million in royalties and licensing fees.

Although many people clear the infection with a course of antibiotics, others suffer for years from lingering symptoms.\n\nThe first signs of a dangerous tick bite can include a bull's-eye rash, fatigue, fever, headache, muscle pain and a stiff neck. Without appropriate treatment, Lyme can cause arthritis, heart conditions and affect the nervous system.\n\nAn earlier Lyme vaccine, LYMErix, was taken off the market in 2002 after concerns about its safety, never proven, drove down interest and its manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, withdrew it.\n\nThis trial, with French company Valneva, will enroll about 6,000 volunteers, ages 5 and up at as many as 50 sites in a handful of countries where Lyme is a problem, including the United States.\n\nVLA15 is delivered in three primary doses followed by a booster. Half the volunteers will receive a saline placebo for the first three doses and half will get a saline placebo as a booster, the company said.\n\nThe vaccine targets the outer surface protein of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Blocking this protein apparently inhibits the bacteria's ability to jump from tick to person.\n\nWATCH:Lyme disease is on the rise: What to do if you get a tick bite\n\nThe vaccine protects against six forms of the protein expressed by the bacterial species present in North American and Europe.\n\nIn earlier trials in both labs and people, the vaccine \"demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile,\" the companies said.\n\nAssuming this Phase 3 trial goes well, the companies would likely submit a request for approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2025.\n\n“With increasing global rates of Lyme disease, providing a new option for people to help protect themselves from the disease is more important than ever,” Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer's senior vice president and head of vaccine research & development, said in a statement. “We hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 study will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date.\"\n\nPfizer agreed to make a $25 million milestone payment to Valneva with Monday's trial start.

The asking price? $299,000.\n\nThe transaction was flagged by the assessor’s office, which says it quickly notified the title company involved about the issue. The culprit? Apparently, all it takes is four keystrokes to accidentally give someone the title to properties worth millions of dollars.\n\n“It appears Westminster Title out of Las Vegas may have copied and pasted a legal description from another Toll Brothers transfer when preparing (the homebuyer’s) deed for recordation,” said Cori Burke, chief deputy assessor for Washoe County, when reached on Monday.\n\n“Because it was pretty clear a mistake was made, our assessment services division reached out to Westminster Title right away so they could begin working on correcting the chain of title for the 86 properties transferred in error.”\n\nThe Washoe County Assessor’s Office updates ownership information for such transactions based on the legal description provided in the recording as opposed to the parcel number, according to Burke. In this case, the legal description in the transaction that was officially recorded on July 25 specifically stated that it encompasses “lots 1 through 85 … and Common Areas A and B.”\n\nFlagging errors caused by incorrect legal descriptions actually happens “fairly often,” largely due to copy-and-paste mistakes, according to Burke.\n\n“This particular case is just a little more interesting because of the number of lots involved,” Burke said.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nCorrecting the mix-up will require the homebuyer in question to transfer the title back to Toll Brothers. Once those documents are recorded, ownership can transfer from Toll Brothers to any new property owners through our normal process, Burke said.\n\nJust how easy the process will be is going to depend on how cooperative the other party is. With several of the properties involved already sold to other buyers, any extended delay in getting back the title could cause potential headaches.\n\n“I think someone could try to make things difficult,\" Burke said. \"However, the title company also has the offer and acceptance for the purchase on file so intent is pretty clear. I would think it would be a loser in court and doubt it happens often, if at all.”\n\nThe Reno Gazette Journal has reached out to Toll Brothers for comment. The RGJ has also reached out to a Sparks resident with the same name as the buyer and received a “no comment” response with a smiley face emoji.\n\nFollow Jason Hidalgo on Twitter @jasonhidalgo.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/tmobile2022/2022/02/10/4-tricks-phone-scammers-using-2022-and-how-stop-them/6720737001/", "title": "4 tricks phone scammers are using in 2022 – and how to stop them", "text": "Cemile Kavountzis,\n\nfor T-Mobile\n\nWhether you’re about to sit down to dinner, catching up with an old friend or simply taking a well-deserved nap, an unwanted robocall always seems to disrupt your day at the most inconvenient time.\n\nBut unwanted robocalls and scams are more than just annoying interruptions; they can actually be dangerous. Last year, the volume of scam call attempts exploded to record highs. They were the top complaint reported to the FCC and Americans lost some $30 billion to these ploys.\n\nIf you’re concerned, or even just annoyed, you should be. There was a 116% increase in scam attempts last year alone, according to new network data reported by T-Mobile, and the bombardment of calls is set to soon pass pre-pandemic levels.\n\nDespite efforts across the wireless industry, the tactics used by bad actors around the globe have become more aggressive over time and even more deceptive in their efforts to appear legitimate. Scammers are relentless – and they are not going to stop as long as they keep making money.\n\nAt the end of 2021, T-Mobile released its first-ever Scam and Robocall Report, which identified trends across the country, insights into scammer behavior and ways the company responded. T-Mobile’s Scam Shield technology, for example, identified or blocked more than 21 billion scam calls for their customers in 2021 – more than double the number of calls in 2020. That’s roughly the equivalent of 700 spam calls every second.\n\n“We are protecting every single customer with the free scam-fighting tools in Scam Shield, regardless of their plan or device,” said Jon Freier, president of T-Mobile’s Consumer Group, in a statement on the company’s website. “We know that scammers won’t stop as long as they continue to be successful, so we are doing everything we can to make their job as hard as possible.”\n\nThe T-Mobile report also shared some of the most common phone scams and ways to protect your information.\n\n1. ‘Neighborhood’ calls\n\nOne location-based trick scammers use is called neighbor or neighborhood spoofing, in which they disguise their number to appear as if it is coming from a local number, using a similar area code or prefix to your number.\n\nT-Mobile’s Scam and Robocall Report found certain areas of the country are more heavily targeted by scam calls than other parts. The states with the highest volume of scam call attempts in 2021 were Texas, Florida, Arizona and Georgia. Among those, Dallas/Fort Worth was the top metro area for receiving scam calls.\n\nTo help stop neighborhood spoofing, last year companies across the wireless industry implemented number verification powered by STIR/SHAKEN. T-Mobile was the first to implement number verification for customers and T-Mobile, Sprint and Metro by T-Mobile customers with an eligible device will get a checkmark to confirm the phone number displayed on your phone is the actual number calling and hasn’t been spoofed by a scammer.\n\n2. Legitimate businesses scams: fake auto warranties\n\nOne of the biggest concerns heading in to 2022 is scammers posing as legitimate businesses. If you’ve gotten a call from someone regarding your car’s warranty, you’re already familiar with this one. In 2021, the top scam was fake auto warranties, making up 51% of all scam call attempts.\n\nOther common fraudulent calls were from individuals pretending to represent car insurance companies (6%), social security (10%), wireless providers (9%) and package delivery (4%).\n\nWhat is particularly concerning about scams like the auto warranty scam is the caller may already have some personal details about your car or warranty. These calls often start with a robocall instructing you to press a number and stay on the line.\n\nTo help screen these calls, you can use tools such as Caller ID combined with number verification or use your wireless provider’s scam identification tools. As part of Scam Shield protections, T-Mobile gives free Caller ID to every customer. And when a scam threat is detected, customers automatically receive a “Scam Likely” warning on their Caller ID display. They can then decide if they want to answer the call or not.\n\nEven if you decide to answer a likely scam call, to protect yourself from any suspected fraudulent business calls, your best bet is to hang up and call the company back directly by looking up their customer service contact information on the Internet.\n\n3. Time of year: tax season and health care scams\n\nScammers are savvy and will capitalize on seasonal events to ramp up call attempts. With tax season coming up, phone scammers will often prey on people’s anxiety surrounding their taxes.\n\nTo keep yourself protected, know that generally, the IRS will first mail a bill to any taxpayer who owes taxes. They also won’t call about an unexpected tax refund. If you receive a call requesting immediate payment in the form of gift cards, threatening to bring in law enforcement for unpaid bills, or demanding payment without a bill or opportunity to question the amount, stay alert – it’s likely a scam.\n\nSimilarly, scam calls relating to health care spiked during open enrollment for health insurance and Medicare in late fall and winter. The FCC issued a $225 million fine – the largest in its history – in 2021 to a Texas-based telemarketer for robocalls falsely claiming to represent major health insurance companies.\n\nAlong with a seasonal ramping up, another method scammers use to appear above board is keeping regular business hours Monday to Friday with peak volume on Wednesdays. T-Mobile’s report found spam call volume drops by as much as 85% on weekends.\n\nTo keep yourself protected against the newest seasonal threats, you’ll want software that is updated regularly. T-Mobile claims that its scam protections are updated every 6 minutes, every day, all day. And unlike apps from third-parties, T-Mobile’s Scam Shield sits within the network, so it uses AI, machine learning and patented technology to update against new threats in real time.\n\n4. Technical support calls\n\nAnother avenue scammers use to weasel their way in is fake technical support calls. These calls can result in cyber criminals getting access to your data or planting malicious code on your phone or computer.\n\nFake technical support calls will often begin with the scammer saying they’re with a well-known company and that an issue has been detected with your device. From there, they’ll walk you through various steps to “fix” your phone or computer. Don’t be fooled – scammers who pull this trick will be attempting to download dangerous software used to obtain your data.\n\nT-Mobile warns that every wireless customer should use some form of scam protection to help prevent these calls getting through. Fortunately, in addition to “Scam Likely” warnings, T-Mobile’s Scam Shield also includes Scam Block, which once activated, blocks all “Scam Likely” calls before they ever reach your phone, giving you the peace and quiet you deserve. If you are a T-Mobile customer, you can download the Scam Shield app for free in your device’s app store.\n\nAs long as scammers are still able to make money off unsuspecting victims, their tactics will keep evolving. Thankfully, the technology used to protect people from these cyber criminals will continue to advance, as well – that’s why it’s crucial to utilize scam protection software to protect yourself.\n\nTo learn more about T-Mobile or view the 2021 Scam and Robocall Report, visit https://www.t-mobile.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/11/fact-check-national-property-tax-isnt-part-joe-bidens-plan/5761622002/", "title": "Fact check: National property tax isn't part of Joe Biden's plan", "text": "The claim: Joe Biden, if elected president, would enact a national 3% property tax.\n\nEveryone wants to know how the presidential election will affect their wallets.\n\nOne viral Facebook post claims Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden would institute a federal property tax.\n\nThe post from Sept. 6 reads: \"Biden wants to put a 3% annual federal tax on your home. Do you want him for POTUS?\" It had been shared more than 4,300 times and amassed over 150 comments as of Friday morning. USA TODAY has reached out to the poster for comment.\n\nThis is not the lone misinformation regarding Biden's tax plans. Recently, viral claims on Facebook said tax rates for some families would more than double if Biden were elected president. USA Today concluded those claims were false.\n\nThe poster did not respond to USA TODAY's request for evidence to back up his claim.\n\nFederal government cannot collect property tax\n\nBiden has not proposed a federal property tax as part of his tax plan, and in fact, it may not be legal to do so.\n\nThe federal government is generally barred from levying property taxes under the Constitution. Article 1, Clause 9, Section 4 states: \"No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\"\n\nA direct tax is one paid straight to the government, while \"proportion to the census\" and \"enumeration\" mean that any tax would have to be based on population.\n\nThere are exceptions, such as federal income tax. It is permitted due to the 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, which states: \"the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\"\n\nProperty tax, however, has no such exemption.\n\nProperty taxes are collected at the state and local level, with the state also establishing guidelines for local governments to impose them. Local governments rely heavily on property taxes, while they may account for only a small portion of state revenues.\n\nPolitiFact also debunked the 3% property tax rumor, with Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, telling the fact-checker that \"based on our review of the campaign materials and our conversations with the campaign to try and clarify what their proposals are … there’s nothing there. We haven’t encountered anything that could be construed as a tax on homes.\"\n\nJoe Biden's tax plan focuses on high earners, corporate rate\n\nBiden's tax plan is called \"highly progressive\" by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, which says that it would increase taxes by 13%-18% of after-tax income for the top 1% of earners, and indirectly increase taxes for most others by 0.2%-0.6%.\n\nThose elements were compiled based on estimates by the Tax Policy Center, Penn Wharton Budget Model, Tax Foundation and American Enterprise Institute in addition to supplements from Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nMore:A majority of Americans see Biden as more empathetic to those with COVID-19 than Trump, survey finds\n\nMajor components of Biden's tax plan would \"raise the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent, set minimum corporate taxes for domestic and foreign income, restore the top individual tax rate from 37 to 39.6 percent, tax capital gains as ordinary income and at death for very high earners, limit various tax breaks for higher earners, subject wages above $400,000 to the Social Security payroll tax, and pass various other cuts and increases,\" CRFB says. It also would provide credit for first-time homebuyers and a refundable renter's credit for low-income renters and increase the child care and dependent care tax credits.\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that Biden's plan would \"lead to 7.8 percent less after-tax income for the top 1 percent of taxpayers, 1.1 percent lower after-tax income for the top 5 percent, and around 0.6 percent less after-tax income for other income quintiles.\"\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nThis claim is FALSE, based on our research. Joe Biden has not proposed a 3% property tax.

What ...", "text": "Jenny Espino\n\nRedding\n\nHabitat for Humanity Shasta Cascade and its sister organization have stopped all building even as the North State's housing problems escalate, instead spending almost a third of their combined budget on the CEO's salary and much of the remainder on a variety of programs in Africa, the Record Searchlight has found.\n\nMeanwhile, housing construction has begun to recover in the region — for those who can pay. Prices are back on an upward slope. But waitlists are above 1,000 for affordable rentals, and the last time a home was built in Redding that a low-income person could afford to buy was in 2014, according to city records.\n\nHabitat for Humanity Shasta Cascade has built nothing since 2011 when it moved two families into new homes in Shasta Lake.\n\nInnovations Housing, a second organization Habitat president and CEO Jim Koenigsaecker launched in 2007 to develop apartments, prefabricated modulars and compact single-family homes at a faster rate than the one or two homes a year he could raise under Habitat's self-help home building model, also has not built in about six years. At its founding, Koenigsaecker said Innovations also established a mission of service in Africa.\n\nKoenigsaecker says the Habitat board split the corporation into three separate entities in 2007 to expand charitable activities. Innovations Housing was established to pursue projects that did not fit into Habitat's mission and Building Innovations Group, the for-profit subsidiary, was set up for licensing, insurance, liability and tax purposes.\n\nIn the most recent public financial disclosures available, for fiscal year 2016, 97 percent of the combined revenues of the two nonprofits was attributed to Innovations Housing. Innovations pays all of Koenigsaecker's salary.\n\nKoenigsaecker, 47, left the newspaper industry in 2002 to run Habitat. Today, he is largely focused on new causes in Africa, including traveling to Kenya to train police reservists and rangers in combat techniques to fight wildlife poachers.\n\nKoenigsaecker says his Habitat chapter-related duties are primarily office work, such as receiving mortgage payments, paying property taxes and property insurance premiums and preparing various governmental reports.\n\nAs for Innovations Housing, Koenigsaecker divides his time between the maintenance of the homes already built in Shasta County and the projects in east Africa.\n\nAt $100,000 a year, his pay represents 28 percent of the two nonprofits' 2016 expenditures, according to W-2 forms he provided and IRS tax forms for the charity.\n\nIn addition to the shift away from providing new housing in local communities, a months-long investigation by the Record Searchlight found:\n\nDespite promoting an array of programs, Innovations Housing invests only about a third of its budget directly into charitable work, according to its three most recent federal tax filings, known as Form 990s.\n\nKoenigsaecker is among the highest paid of North State nonprofit CEOs who serve economically disadvantaged people, according to a comparative analysis of 2015 tax filings. His compensation is well above the national median for executives who run nonprofits with approximately $250,000 in revenue, but is close to the California median for such organizations.\n\nA leading charity expert who reviewed the 2016 and prior years' reports at the newspaper's request said Innovations Housing lacks transparency in how it reports some fundraising activities, program expenses in Africa and executive compensation.\n\nAlthough Koenigsaecker insists the organizations cannot build in the current environment, numerous other small nonprofits, including other North State Habitat chapters, are doing just that.\n\nKoenigsaecker, while expressing no specific plans to focus on housing in the region, has said he has no plans to relinquish the Habitat chapter to anyone else, although he also said no one has stepped up.\n\nHabitat for Humanity International recently stopped listing the Shasta Cascade chapter among California affiliates. A spokesman for the international organization responded to requests for explanation or comment by referring the newspaper back to Koenigsaecker.\n\nThe local Habitat chapter's most recent tax filings show little fundraising activity for future projects. The nonprofit reported less than $10,000 in revenue in fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2016. What money it did raise for the past three years mostly went to administrative costs.\n\nAlthough Innovations Housing raises more than $200,000 each year from a raffle started by the Habitat chapter in 2001, overhead costs consume about two-thirds of the budget. In fiscal year 2016, the nonprofit reported a loss of nearly $86,000 after paying Koenigsaecker's salary.\n\nThat financial situation stands in sharp contrast to 2007, when the Habitat chapter spent $1.2 million to build seven homes and rebuild a cottage in Shasta County and spent just under $63,000 on administration costs.\n\nKoenigsaecker defended the work of Innovations Housing over the past decade, which coincided with the worst economic downturn in recent history.\n\nThe organization reluctantly had to put many of its plans on hold, he said, and then was dealt another blow with the loss of redevelopment agencies in 2011, one of the key funding sources for affordable housing in California.\n\nKoenigsaecker stressed the obstacles small organizations like his face to build affordable homes. Unless new funding sources open up, there are no plans to take on new construction, he said. Before redevelopment was abolished, its funds provided local financing for about a dozen homes the Habitat Shasta Cascade chapter built in Redding.\n\n\"They have not yet figured out a way to fund affordable housing. We had to go from building projects to maintaining projects because the funding is not there,\" he said.\n\nAll told, Koenigsaeker said, Innovations Housing has developed and maintained 19 projects, including two community centers in Nairobi, Kenya, seven affordable homes in the North State, scholarships to about 200 students who attend a school in Kyebando, Uganda, and the mixed-use building on Pine Street that houses the Coffee Bar on the first floor and two apartments on the second floor.\n\nThat two-story building, built in 2009 and partially funded by raffle proceeds, helped revitalize a part of downtown that needed the boost. In an interview, Koenigsaecker called it \"a problem spot and people were doing bad things.\" Since the coffee shop opened, it has become a gathering place for residents while also providing employment to eight people.\n\nThe board, Koenigsaecker said, also encourages him to be active in the community. He is the co-founder of the political action committee Citizens for Smart Growth and the Redding Affordable Housing Loan Fund. He completed the Leadership Redding program, served on its steering committee and donates $1,000 annually through Innovations Housing.\n\nRegarding his new effort to protect wildlife, he said his job as CEO is to implement the board's vision.\n\n\"Our board has a passion for protecting wild places and animals. Our founding mission statement was 'To protect and foster natural and human habitats for living, working and playing in Northern California and East Africa.'\"\n\nKoenigsaecker also said the board had changed course because of public criticism.\n\n\"It seemed to me that we were being criticized for not doing enough in Redding when we had redirected our efforts in part because we had previously been criticized — in certain circles including in the newspaper — for trying to do too much in Redding,\" he said.\n\nKoeningsaecker is a former Record Searchlight assistant managing editor of photos and design. He was named executive director of the Habitat chapter in 2002, after spending free time volunteering there. Koenigsaecker said he was driven in part by remorse about the impact of his own journalism, which he said helped propel the city to close down troubled residential motels but also cost their residents a place to live.\n\nIn numerous emails since August 2017, both in direct response to questions and unsolicited, Koenigsaecker expressed alarm at the newspaper's interest in how Innovations Housing spends its money and time. He warned that the organization is represented by international law firm Baker McKenzie and can bring a libel claim in Great Britain, Kenya and Uganda, where laws, he said, are more favorable to plaintiffs.\n\nBrad Eltin from Baker McKenzie said in an email that the law firm \"handled a few small matters for the organization about five years ago.\"\n\n\"Your reporting has already caused me and several of the other board members significant mental anguish and emotional distress,\" he wrote in one of the most recent. \"It is also reasonable to expect that publication of your story will cause further harm to our reputations and future economic opportunities. But, worst of all, your continued harassment has distracted us from our important work.\"\n\nThe Shasta Cascade chapter has four directors on its board and Innovations Housing has five.\n\nDavid Twyman of Twyman Plumbing is a longtime director on both the Habitat chapter and Innovations Housing boards. In an email, he said he was one of the people who hired Koenigsaecker 16 years ago and expressed the board's support for him.\n\n\"Jim is a good man who works hard and has the full support of the board and our sympathy for all the flak he takes as the face of our organization. Another negative article in the newspaper will not change any of those things,\" Twyman wrote.\n\nTerry Topolski, an architect and the only other longtime director who serves on both boards, declined to comment and referred questions to Koenigsaecker, who he said speaks for the organizations.\n\nThe Record Searchlight also sought comment from Habitat for Humanity International about its expectations for affiliates. But Bryan Thomas, a Habitat spokesman at the organization's Atlanta headquarters, responded after repeated requests for comment with an e-mail:\n\n\"I believe you have been in touch with Jim Koenigsaecker at Shasta Cascade. He’s best suited to respond to your questions.\"\n\nLocally, most of Innovations Housing's services revolve around downtown, the Parkview Avenue area behind City Hall and Clover Creek Preserve in east Redding.\n\nIt rents the two market-rate apartments on Pine Street and the cottage at 4014 Saffron Way in the preserve. Koenigsacker said these units house low-income people at affordable rent prices. One of those apartments in 2013 was advertised on Craigslist as a 964-square-foot, two-bedroom \"luxury loft\" that rents for $1,100 a month.\n\nThe three most recent tax filings show Innovations Housing reported expenses of about $26,000 in low-income rental annually.\n\nThe Coffee Bar trains eight low-income people and pays $16 an hour on average, Koenigsaecker has said. It operates under Innovations Housing's for-profit subsidiary and all its after-tax profits go to Innovations Housing. He estimated that amount to be about $9,500 a year.\n\nThe raffle keeps Innovations Housing going financially.\n\nAlmost $9 of every $10 the organization reported in revenue in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 were tied to the annual raffle, according to IRS filings. The raffle winner can accept an RV or $250,000 in cash.\n\nThe local Habitat chapter started the raffle to fund home construction. The fundraiser passed to Innovations Housing in 2008. Last year, it made $578,700 on ticket sales, according to a raffle report submitted in September to the California Department of Justice.\n\nThe winner, Reuben Bigger, 74, of Pahrump, Nevada, received $250,000.\n\nIn marketing emails, Innovations Housing says the proceeds from its raffle enable it to continue to work on community projects around the world. But the Nonprofit Raffle Reports for the past five years to the DOJ say the proceeds are used for \"construction and management of community projects including affordable housing.\"\n\nJust over a decade ago, the housing market crashed, dealing a devastating blow to the local economy and forcing an unprecedented number of homeowners into foreclosure. But the drop in real estate prices had one positive effect: It reversed the price inflation that had been fueling an affordability problem through the early 2000s.\n\nFor buyers who could stay in the market and hadn't lost out in foreclosure, homes were relatively cheap. As Koenigsaecker put it in 2012 — the year Innovations Housing submitted a proposal to run Castle Crags State Park because it was in danger of closing due to state budget cuts — the Redding area didn't need new homes.\n\nMORE:Two residents sue Shasta County to tackle housing crisis\n\nThe market has since rebounded.\n\nHomes in Redding's largest new subdivision, Salt Creek Heights, start at $471,000. But developer Jeb Allen has said some sales exceeded $700,000.\n\nThe city's blueprint for housing, the Consolidated Plan for 2015 to 2019, shows 86 percent of low-income homeowners spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing expenses.\n\nMORE:Redding eyes partnerships to add affordable housing\n\nThe rental market also has gotten more expensive. Among working poor households who rent, nearly three in four live in overcrowded, substandard housing in Redding, according to the Consolidated Plan.\n\nThe Shasta County Housing Authority in 2016 had about 2,000 people on its waitlist for rental assistance and is closed to new applications. In Redding, the waitlist of about 1,015 local applicants is still open.\n\nHabitat chapters are autonomous nonprofit groups directed by their boards. Their projects are based on the needs they see in their region, such as constructing homes, apartments or undertaking rehabilitation work.\n\nHabitat homeowners work with volunteers to build their houses while being mentored on homeownership responsibilities. Habitat requires chapters to offer interest-free mortgages to home buyers.\n\nKoenigsaecker, however, expressed concerns about Habitat. In a March 22 email he sent to community activist and retired Turtle Bay CEO Judy Salter, which he then forwarded to the Record Searchlight, he said in his 16 years working with Habitat he has learned its model has \"serious limitations.\"\n\n\"On average it takes more time and money for Habitat to construct a house using volunteers than for a similar market-rate house to be constructed by a for-profit builder. More importantly, decent, existing houses in our community usually sell for less than the cost of new construction,\" he wrote.\n\nHabitat certainly isn't the only local organization working to provide housing.\n\nFor example, Northern Valley Catholic Social Service last May opened the Woodlands, a 54-unit gated community on Polk Street in Redding for families trying to make ends meet and residents with a mental illness.\n\nRedding-based Community Revitalization and Development Corp. develops low-income housing throughout the state. In Redding, it is working on projects on Veda Street near the Good News Rescue Mission and Azalea Avenue off Hilltop Drive.\n\nIts president, Dave Rutledge, confirms there's little local funding for affordable housing, and that's especially problematic for large developments.\n\nThe city of Redding has a pool of money to allocate in support of housing projects, and it has committed all of it through 2020 to the K2 Development Co.'s mixed-use proposal in downtown, Redding Housing Manager Steve Bade said. The four-story building will have 56 of its 82 units designated affordable housing.\n\n\"We are trying to scrape and claw what we can,\" Bade said.\n\nCathy Taylor said she began to ask about the local Habitat affiliate shortly after she founded the California Heritage YouthBuild Academy in 2012. The charter school is a campus of YouthBuild USA, a pre-apprenticeship program funded by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nIn most of California and the rest of the country, Habitat and YouthBuild programs work together to provide affordable housing. The construction schedule is slowed down to be at the right pace for amateurs.\n\nTaylor and her staff want to put more students to work and tried reaching out to Habitat Shasta Cascade. Over the past six years, she said, they have sent emails, left voicemails and visited Koenigsaecker's downtown office to discuss working together. She and school Principal Lane Carlson even left a note on Koenigsaecker's office door, she said. But, she said, they have yet to get a response.\n\nKoenigsaecker said he was unaware the school is trying to contact him and is open to a meeting. But, he said by email, \"since we do not have the funding to build new affordable housing at this time, we are not sure why we would need to partner with them. And if they have the funding to build new affordable housing, we do not understand why they would need us.\"\n\nAsked why he holds on to the chapter if he no longer believes in the Habitat model and he does not see a more affordable way to build through the organization, Koenigsaecker wrote of the legal, financial and ethical responsibilities to the Habitat mortgages originated by the chapter and related governmental reporting requirements.\n\n\"No other individual or organization has volunteered to assume those responsibilities and liabilities,\" he said.\n\nWithout Habitat, Taylor said, the school cannot secure enough jobs in Shasta County to enroll more students.\n\n\"We continue to build partnerships within the community,\" she said, noting efforts to work through the Shasta Builders' Exchange, attendance of community meetings on housing and YouthBuild's own personal connections. \"But I think Habitat is the main partnership.\"\n\nIn the past few years, Innovations Housing turned more of its attention to projects in east Africa. That work is part of its founding mission.\n\nOne of the original board members of Innovations Housing, Jim Warnemuende, said around 2013 he came to his fellow board members and Koenigsaecker to ask for financial assistance for a school his wife, Carolyn, had started near Kampala, Uganda, about a decade before. The God is Good Preparatory School is a K-8 school once supported by the Water and Stone Center in Mount Shasta, a nonprofit run by John Cunningham. Cunningham said he handed over the support for the school to Innovations Housing about five years ago. He served on the Innovations Housing board of directors from 2014 to 2015.\n\nToday, Koenigsaecker said Innovations Housing provides $20,000 in scholarships to about 200 students at the school.\n\n\"It was a great fit because Jim Koenigsaecker, he has an affinity for Africa and he goes over there,” Cunningham said. “That was one of the things we did; we sent somebody there for boots on the ground.”\n\nKoenigsaecker said he fell in love with Africa on his first trip because it was like an Ernest Hemingway novel. He wrote in an email about the wildlife killed by heavily armed poachers and urban sprawl that have been changing that.\n\nThe Innovations Housing board last year started an anti-poaching pilot program in Kenya and Koenigsaecker traveled there last July to train Kenya police reservists and Kenya Wildlife Service rangers to take up arms against poachers. Koenigsaecker said he worked with the Kenyans on physical fitness, rifle maintenance, marksmanship and tactics. Since leaving, he said, he has continued to \"send messages to the rangers on their mobile phones for daily workouts, drills and moral support.\"\n\nAsked about his qualifications, he wrote in part, \"let’s just say that I have lived an adventurous life. And at 47 I can still run a mile in under 6 minutes, deadlift 420 pounds, squat 320 pounds and bench press 240 pounds. I can also put 15 rounds in a tight group at 25 yards with a pistol from the holster in under 5 seconds. And I am equally proficient with a rifle out to 500 yards, a blade or hand-to-hand.\"\n\nAdditionally, Innovations Housing is advocating for the Kenyan and U.S. governments to put more effort into combating poaching and habitat destruction, Koenigsaecker said.\n\n“For a few thousand dollars a year, we can have a real impact on this situation in East Africa, while it takes hundreds of thousands of dollars to build just one home in Redding for one-low income family,” he said.\n\nAt the Record Searchlight's request, the president and founder of a Chicago-based organization that monitors and ranks charities reviewed the 2016 tax filings for both Innovations Housing and Habitat for Humanity Shasta Cascade. At the time of that review, the 2017 figures had not yet been publicly posted.\n\nDaniel Borochoff of CharityWatch raised concerns about transparency in IRS-mandated disclosures, including the Coffee Bar's sales revenue, executive compensation and donation expenses.\n\nIn 2016, Innovations Housing spent less than 30 percent of its $344,778 budget on program services. The previous year, the share was 38 percent and in 2014, 22 percent.\n\nProgram expenses are those that achieve a nonprofit's mission. “The better groups are able to get 70 percent into the programs,” Borochoff said.\n\nHe also was unable to determine what Innovations Housing earns at the coffee shop, how much it sets aside for the student scholarships to the school in Uganda or what Koenigsaecker’s salary was, because it was reported as zero on the compensation schedule.\n\nThe local Habitat chapter and Innovations Housing filed their Form 990s for fiscal year 2017 in November, about three months after the Record Searchlight began to inquire about the nonprofit’s expenses. That most recent Innovations filing, now available through GuideStar.org, contains more detail than the years immediately prior.\n\nIt shows Koenigsaecker’s salary as $100,000.\n\nA checklist on the IRS Form 990 requires nonprofits to note if they provide financial aid of more than $5,000 to an foreign recipient. For the first time since 2012, Innovations on the 2017 form checked the box \"yes.\" That triggers the requirement for additional information. On that other schedule, Innovations reported student scholarship expenses in sub-Saharan Africa as $20,180, but did not name the school.\n\nTuition expenses could not be identified in previous filings, although Koenigsaecker said the organization took over the scholarships in Uganda in 2013.\n\nNonprofit attorney Paul Dostart, a partner at Dostart Hannink & Coveney in La Jolla who also reviewed the 2016 federal tax filing, was left with unanswered questions.\n\nLike CharityWatch, he questioned the lack of compensation for Koenigsaecker. He asked why Innovations Housing appears to have reported its raffle proceeds in a line that corresponds to its charitable purposes, such as low-income housing. He also noted the gross receipts amount from the raffle reported to the IRS and California Department of Justice are different.\n\n“When you have questions of this type raised, it is the duty of the board to conduct an investigation,\" Dostart said. \"Typically, they retain somebody outside of the organization because frankly the board may be implicated in lax oversight, not having done its job.”\n\nBoard of directors member Warnemuende emailed to clarify the board in 2006 set Koenigsaecker's salary at $100,000.\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, his salary was reported to the IRS as $125,000. But for the tax years of 2015, 2016 and 2017, personal W-2 forms Koenigsaecker provided show he was paid just over $100,000 each year.\n\nA compensation analysis by economist Linda Lampkin, the former director of the National Center for Charitable Statistics at the Urban Institute, shows the median pay nationally for an executive who runs a housing- and shelter-related nonprofit generating revenues of $250,000 is $74,767. Lampkin's analysis shows Koenigsaecker's salary as on par with the California median, which includes high-cost regions such as the Bay Area and Southern California.\n\nThe data comes from ERI Economic Research Institute.\n\nNonprofit boards have wide discretion in what they pay their executives. Innovations Housing's IRS filings state it consults charity benchmarks in setting Koenigsaecker's salary.\n\nIn contrast to Habitat Shasta Cascade, three other Habitat chapters in the North State have found funding to keep building. They lean on government agencies for land. They turn to trust funds, fundraisers, corporate donors, banks, volunteers and any grants they can scoop up for construction.\n\nThe Yuba/Sutter County affiliate recently broke ground on a 36-home subdivision paid for in part by a $6.8 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The homes will cost from $120,000 to $140,000 to build, with savings coming from volunteer labor.\n\n“Every grant that we get is that feeling … we are going to do amazing things,” said Chief Administrative Officer Morgane Brown. “It’s like wow. It’s an incredible opportunity.”\n\nMORE:Affordable housing prospects looking sunnier in Redding\n\nIn Butte County, Habitat builds about two homes a year. In Siskiyou County, the all-volunteer organization threw itself into helping Weed rebuild from the Boles Fire, which in 2014 destroyed 150 homes. Volunteers finished their first home last year, are working on two more homes this year and want to build another in 2019.\n\nButte County Habitat for Humanity spent more than $500,000 in fiscal year 2016.\n\nIts executive director, Nicole Bateman, said it’s taken her Habitat affiliate 25 years to get 30 homes built.\n\n“But we do feel like we’re making a little dent in neighborhoods,” she said. “It’s one house at a time, one family at a time.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/29/pony-swim-bali-myna-hatches-giant-catfish-news-around-states/50539981/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMonroeville: The Swiss owner of a pulp mill in Alabama said it is investing $80 million to increase the amount of absorbent pulp it can produce there. The second line at the GP Cellulose Alabama River mill near Monroeville should be able to produce rolls of the absorbent material called fluff pulp in late 2023, a news release said. It said some major aspects are complete. The mill’s first line has been able to produce bales of paper pulp and rolls of fluff pulp since 2011. Fluff pulp is used in such items as diapers and feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products. The mill employs about 470 people.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A plane with seven people on board bound for Katmai National Park and Preserve crashed into the water as it was leaving a seaplane base in Anchorage, with two people suffering serious injuries, authorities said. Clint Johnson, chief of the National Transportation Safety Board’s Alaska division, said the information he initially received was that there were six people on board. He said he was later told there were seven on board. Aaron Danielson, chief of the Ted Stevens International Airport Police and Fire, said there was some “initial confusion on scene.” A statement from the department late Tuesday afternoon said all seven were taken to area hospitals for evaluation and treatment. Johnson said the plane operated by Regal Air had taken off and was in its initial climb phase when the accident occurred. The airport police and fire department said the plane was conducting a water takeoff “when, according to the pilot, a strong crosswind caused the right wing to rise after the plane was airborne. While the pilot attempted to make corrections,” the plane crashed. Johnson said investigators are still gathering information. There have been strong winds in the Anchorage area recently but “we don’t know if that played a part in it or not.” He said the passengers were from outside Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The Coconino County Board of Supervisors approved the transfer of $5 million to the county’s flood control district to deal with monsoonal flooding problems. Meanwhile Wednesday, Mayor Paul Deasy declared a state of emergency to make the city eligible for additional resources to support disaster response. The disaster grant assistance would help cover the costs associated with public infrastructure damage, including debris removal, emergency protective measures and the restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities. Since July 16, Flagstaff has experienced days of steady and heavy rain that has inundated neighborhoods in the shadow of mountains that burned recently. County officials said the flash flooding has impacted the Timberline, Wupatki Trails and Doney Park areas, as well as the west side of Flagstaff. The annual monsoon season is expected to last through September, with the possibility of daily rainfall. County officials believe the continued costs of flood mitigation could exceed the costs of the aftermath of the Schultz Fire in 2010, which were $5.6 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Robert Craig, the oldest living World War II veteran of the 101st Airborne in Arkansas and the third-oldest World War II veteran in the U.S., celebrated his 100th birthday on July 18 amid much fanfare at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. Craig was a part of the fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, the last major German offensive on the Western front. For almost a week during the battle, German soldiers surrounded Craig’s division. The Americans received supplies from airdrops. Gen. George Patton eventually broke through and delivered food and medical supplies. “I’m rather proud of the service I rendered,” said Craig, who received seven bronze stars and a presidential citation for his service.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city’s newest bridge, a $588 million architectural marvel with views of the downtown skyline, opened to great fanfare on July 10 but has been closed several times since then amid chaos and collisions. The 6th Street Viaduct – which soars over the concrete-lined Los Angeles River to connect downtown to the historic Eastside – quickly became a hot spot for street racing, graffiti and illegal takeovers that draw hundreds of spectators to watch drivers perform dangerous stunts in their vehicles. The Los Angeles Police Department has closed the bridge multiple times – an exact count was not available Wednesday – and in the latest move, announced Tuesday that it would be “closed until further notice due to illegal activity and public safety concerns” before backtracking and reopening it hours later. Officials hope to install speed bumps, safety fences and cameras on the less than 3-week-old bridge to curtail the behavior. In the meantime, officers are impounding vehicles and issuing citations. The bridge spans 3,500 feet from the trendy Arts District to Boyle Heights, a traditionally working class Latino neighborhood, in the largest and most expensive bridge ever built in the city.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Conservation groups filed lawsuits against state environmental agencies in Colorado and Montana this week targeting coal mines in the states. Two groups sued Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality on Monday over an approved expansion of the Rosebud Mine, a coal strip mine near the Wyoming border. On Tuesday, five organizations including the WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against Colorado environmental agencies alleging they failed to ensure the state’s largest coal mine, West Elk Mine, complied with state and federal clean air laws. The complaint filed in Gunnison County District Court contended that Colorado state officials failed to approve or deny an air pollution permit required by the U.S. government within the 18 months allotted by state law. The federal permit, granted by state agencies, would allow greater oversight over the mine’s compliance with clean air laws and regulations, ensuring that the company was sufficiently restricting methane emissions. If the state denied the permit application, the mine would have to halt operations. West Elk Mine sits in Colorado’s North Fork Valley and is owned by Arch Resources, a company based in St. Louis. The mine produced more than 4 million tons of coal in 2019, according to the Colorado Division of Reclamation, and emits greenhouse gases, including methane.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Former House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, who is running for a chance to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal in November, has come under fire from the conservative wing of the party for her stances, including accusations she’s not a true Republican. More of that criticism was lodged Tuesday night, when Klarides appeared in the first GOP Senate debate with her two conservative challengers in the upcoming Aug. 9 primary. Leora Levy of Greenwich and attorney Peter Lumaj of Fairfield both oppose abortion and further restrictions on gun owners. “There is a contrast here,” Levy said, when comparing herself to Klarides. “And I’m running in a Republican primary, not a Democrat primary. And her views on abortion are more suited to running in a Democrat primary, are more like Senator Blumenthal’s.” Lumaj, however, referred to himself as the only “unwavering conservative” among the three candidates, criticizing Levy for previously supporting abortion rights. He said Republicans in Connecticut have lost statewide races because they nominated candidates who “were afraid to be a Republican.” But Klarides stressed a candidate with such conservative positions won’t win in Connecticut, where the largest voting block is made up of unaffiliated voters, followed by Democrats and then Republicans. There’s also strong support in the state for abortion rights, a key issue in this year’s election after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A catfish species that can grow up to 100 pounds and reach 4 feet in length is threatening a popular Delaware fishing hole and state environmental officials need anglers’ help to rid the waterway of the invasive fish. The culprit is the flathead catfish, a species native to the Mississippi and Ohio watersheds. It was recently found in Lums Pond near Glasgow, according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. Catfish species native to Delaware are scavengers and feed off the bottom of the water bodies in which they live. The flathead catfish eats other species, said Mike Steiger, a DNREC fisheries biologist. If the flathead catfish is left to feed on local species such as shad, crayfish or other pond fish, it could upset the local ecosystem and cause problems for other organisms in the area. “There’s probably not that many in the pond,” Steiger said. “Unchecked, they can definitely have a negative effect on native species.” Steiger is heading a project for the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife with the DNREC Division of Parks and Recreation aimed at removing the flathead catfish from Lums Pond. To capture the invasive species, the groups are using the technique of electro fishing, in which a specialized boat is used to deliver electroshocks in the water that temporarily stuns fish within a certain radius. This does not kill any of the fish but causes the affected fish to rise to the top of water, allowing them to be handled and captured more easily and with less stress for the fish. All flathead catfish that are found are then removed from Lums Pond. DNREC urges all who catch a flathead catfish to remove it from the water and report the incident.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Congressional leaders and Kansas officials praised aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart for advancing the cause of women’s rights during her barrier-breaking career at a ceremony unveiling her statue in the U.S. Capitol. Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, joins President Dwight Eisenhower as Kansas icons enshrined in the National Statuary Hall Collection. She is the 11th woman honored with a statue in the collection, where each state is represented by two people of significance. U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., said although Earhart is best known for flying across the ocean, she was also a military nurse, social worker, author and a champion for women’s advancement. “Female pilots used to be called ‘ladybirds,’ ‘sweethearts of the air,’ and because of Amelia Earhart, back then, now and into the future, women who fly planes are now called ‘pilots,’ ” Davids said. Earhart disappeared in July 1937 on a flight over the Pacific Ocean while trying to become the first pilot to circle the globe at the equator. No trace of her or her navigator, Fred Noonan, has ever been found, sparking numerous theories about what happened to them.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: A woman who left her newborn baby in a trash bin pleaded guilty to attempted murder and child abuse, agreeing to a seven-year prison sentence and potential deportation. Two maintenance workers at a Boca Raton apartment complex heard faint crying sounds coming from the bin and rescued Rafaelle Sousa’s 6-pound, 8-ounce baby. She was taken in by her boyfriend, who named her Sarah, the Palm Beach Post reported. Sousa’s attorney said the 38-year-old Brazilian woman didn’t know she was pregnant until she went into labor, and was in shock when the baby was born three years ago. Sousa, who was already caring for her 3-year-old son, had taken Tylenol and diet pills in the months before the birth to cope with pain and sudden weight gain, but wasn’t able to afford a doctor’s visit and did not know she was expecting another child, her attorney said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams is promoting a plan she said will make housing more available and affordable across Georgia if she defeats Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this year. Abrams repeatedly criticized Kemp for Georgia’s sluggish use of its $989 million in federal rental assistance. Georgia still has almost half that money unused, Abrams said, although the state gave more of it to 12 large local governments that have been quicker to move the money out the door after the U.S. Treasury threatened to take some of it back. Tate Mitchell, a spokesperson for Kemp, said Abrams has Democrats to blame for making the cost of living more expensive. “In the last year alone, Gov. Kemp has allocated $100 million to support nonprofits that provide affordable housing and aid individuals experiencing homelessness,” Mitchell said in a statement. “If Stacey Abrams wants to blame anyone for economic instability, she should start with Joe Biden and her own party.” Abrams said she would seek to bolster Georgia’s weak tenant protections by requiring that leases guarantee the premises will be habitable and by providing a waiting period before a tenant could be evicted. She also would expand state assistance for down payments for first-time homebuyers, require that housing built using the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit serve some households with very low incomes and let local governments offer property tax breaks on affordable housing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A U.S. defense contractor and his wife who lived for decades under the identities of two dead Texas children have been charged with identity theft and conspiring against the government, according to federal court records unsealed in Honolulu. Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison, both in their 60s, who allegedly lived for decades under the names Bobby Edward Fort and Julie Lyn Montague, were arrested Friday in Kapolei on the island of Oahu. Prosecutors are seeking to have the couple held without bail, which could indicate the case is about more than fraudulently obtaining drivers’ licenses, passports and Defense Department credentials. Those documents helped Primrose get secret security clearance with the U.S. Coast Guard and as a defense contractor and old photos showed the couple wearing uniforms of the KGB, the former Russian spy agency, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Muehleck said in court papers. Faded Polaroids of each in uniform were included in the motion to have them held. A “close associate” said Morrison lived in Romania while it was a Soviet bloc country, Muehleck said. Morrison’s attorney said her client never lived in Romania and that she and Primrose tried the same jacket on as a joke and posed for photos in it. Even if the couple used new identities, attorney Megan Kau told The Associated Press, they have lived law-abiding lives for three decades.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho has been selected as the site for a proposed nuclear test reactor that would dramatically reduce the time needed to develop nuclear fuels and components for a new generation of nuclear reactors that could help reduce global warming, the U.S. Department of Energy said. The Energy Department said it selected its 890-square-mile site in eastern Idaho that includes the Idaho National Laboratory to build the Versatile Test Reactor, or VTR. The VTR is a sodium-cooled fast test reactor that would be the first fast spectrum test reactor to operate in the United States in nearly three decades. The Energy Department has requested funding from Congress to move the VTR project into the design phase. The project includes facilities for examining material tested in the reactor, as well as managing spent fuel produced by the reactor. Scientists have said the test reactor could help lead to new nuclear reactors and reduce the use of fossil fuels blamed for global warming. The Energy Department is hoping to have the test reactor running by the end of 2026. Currently, such nuclear testing capacity only exists in Russia, the department said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, 77, of Illinois said he tested positive for the coronavirus and was in quarantine with what he described as minor symptoms. The No. 2 Senate Democrat, who said in a statement he was vaccinated and received two booster shots, planned to continue to work remotely. Durbin’s announcement occurred after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said last week he tested positive following travel to the White House, Maine and Florida. Earlier this week, Pritzker said on Twitter that he tested negative for the virus. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden ended his COVID-19 isolation, days after he also tested positive.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has ordered Indianapolis Public Schools to allow a 10-year-old transgender girl to rejoin her school’s softball team while a lawsuit continues against a state law that bans transgender females from competing in girls school sports. U.S. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson in Indianapolis issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday on behalf of the girl, finding she “has established that she has a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits” of her claim. Indianapolis Public School told the girl’s mother earlier this year that her daughter would no longer be able to play on the softball team because of the new law, the judge added. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed the lawsuit on behalf of the girl in hopes of blocking the law. The suit was filed in May, minutes after Republican state lawmakers voted to override Gov. Eric Holcomb’s veto of the legislation, and alleged that preventing the girl from rejoining her team because she is transgender is violation of Title IX and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials are asking residents to keep an eye out for the spotted laternfly after recently confirming the finding of two of the invasive insects in central Iowa. As a young nymph, it is a black weevil-like bug with white spots but adds patches of bright red as it develops into a flying insect. It’s native to China, India and Vietnam, and was accidentally introduced into Pennsylvania in 2014, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. It has since been confirmed in 11 states and threatens the country’s grape, orchard, nursery and logging industries. The state agricultural department was notified earlier this month of the presence of two immature spotted lanternflies in Dallas County, and federal identification confirmed them. Nearby areas surveyed have not resulted in signs of an ongoing infestation, the department said. Anyone spotting the insect is asked to contact the department’s Entomology and Plant Science Bureau.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:A Bali myna, one of the world’s rarest – and some say most beautiful – birds was hatched this month at the Topeka Zoo. The Asian songbird was born July 2, making it the third species of that bird at the zoo, said Joe Maloney, who works at the zoo with invertebrates. Bali mynas are among the most vocal birds in the zoo’s Tropical Rainforest, where their distinctive plumage and calls make them easily recognizable, Maloney said. The critically endangered The population of Bali mynas in the wild has been reduced by habitat loss and illegal trapping carried out to acquire them to be caged songbirds, said Taylor Miller, the Topeka Zoo’s communications coordinator. Females of the species tend to lay one to three eggs but usually only one will survive, Miller said. “They are cavity nesters, so the chick is currently located in a special box built by keepers,” she said. The box simulates a cavity nest but allows enough space for animal care staff to keep a close watch on them, Miller said. “The mom and dad are excellent parents and you can regularly catch glimpses of them carrying food to their nesting area,” said Wrylie Guffey, animal curator at the zoo. Bali mynas begin flying when they are 3-4 weeks old and become fully independent when they are 6-7 weeks old, Miller said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The University of Pikeville will receive a $4.4 million grant to support construction of an agritech research and education center. The UPIKE Ag-Tech Innovation Center of Excellence will be located at the Kentucky Enterprise Industrial Park at Marion Branch in Pikeville, state officials said. The project will be matched with $5.75 million in local funds. Gov. Andy Beshear announced the grant award Wednesday. The project aims to promote job growth by bringing innovative industry to the area while enhancing educational opportunities for UPIKE students, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nChauvin: Authorities in south-central Louisiana are looking for those responsible for vandalizing the Chauvin Sculpture Garden, a local landmark created by a self-taught artist. Three concrete sculptures were broken, and one is missing, said Gary LaFleur, head of the Center for Bayou Studies at Nicholls State University. Vandals also damaged a sculpture of an angel that held an amber globe, similar to how the Statue of Liberty holds its torch. The garden owned by Nicholls State was created by self-taught artist Kenny Hill when he moved to Chauvin in 1988. A bricklayer by trade, Hill created more than 100 concrete statues along Bayou Little Caillou in Terrebonne Parish before walking away from his home about a decade later. He left no trace of his whereabouts, but about 10,000 visitors each year visit the menagerie of angels, Cajuns, self portraits and other figures he left behind.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Roman Catholic priest is returning to active ministry after an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse, the Diocese of Portland said. The diocese said its investigation into the Rev. Robert Vaillancourt took a year. The allegations concerned sexual abuse of girls in the 1980s. The diocese said in a statement the allegations were “determined to be unfounded.” It said Vaillancourt has not received a new assignment from the diocese yet. Vaillancourt was placed on administrative leave in July 2021 after the diocese received the first complaint. The diocese then received a second allegation from an attorney representing another woman. Vaillancourt denied any wrongdoing at the time of the accusations and the diocese said he cooperated with the investigation. He is a native of Lewiston who has served at parishes across the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island: More military ordnance has washed ashore at Assateague Island National Seashore, the Worcester County Fire Marshal’s Office reported. The fire marshal’s office, along with the U.S. Air Force 436th Civil Engineer Squadron-Emergency Ordnance Disposal team based out of Dover Air Force Base responded to Assateague shortly after 1 p.m. Tuesday for three suspected military ordnance that washed ashore in an area known as North Ocean Beach. It is the second incident of military ordnance washing ashore at Assateauge in as many weeks. National Park Service Rangers reported the suspicious devices. Ordnance disposal technicians determined the devices, which had been in the ocean for an unknown amount of time, needed to be rendered safe in place. From 1944 to 1947, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Corps used the Maryland portion of Assateague Island as a bombing and strafing range. Air crews from Chincoteague, Virginia, and Manteo, North Carolina, would fire practice rockets, bombs and machine guns from the air at targets on the ground.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFitchburg: A decorated State Police dog called “as loyal a partner as any Trooper ever had” by the agency’s commander was shot and killed by a man who had barricaded himself inside a home. Frankie, a nearly 11-year-old Belgian malinois with a tan coat and black snout, was shot Tuesday afternoon by a 38-year-old suspect, according to a statement from State Police Col. Christopher Mason. He was the first State Police dog to die in the line of duty, Mason said. Frankie’s handler, Sgt. David Stucenski, was not injured. Stucenski and Frankie won the state law enforcement Medal of Valor in 2017 for apprehending a suspect who opened fire on them, and also won three awards from the U.S. Police Canine Association in 2014. Police went to the multifamily Fitchburg home at about 9 a.m. Tuesday after learning the suspect, wanted on warrants charging him with firearms offenses, was there. Negotiators tried to get the suspect to surrender peacefully but he refused. Just before 3 p.m., he was spotted at a back door and officers decided to try and apprehend him. Stucenski and Frankie approached, but the suspect fired multiple shots before retreating back inside. He later apparently took his own life. Frankie was shot and taken to an animal hospital where he died, Mason said. Frankie’s body was escorted in a motorcade to the Final Gift Pet Memorial Center pet crematorium in Cranston, Rhode Island, as police officers and firefighters paid tribute on overpasses along the highway. A service to honor Frankie will be held, although a date hasn’t been set, state police said Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A man who admitted to calling in a bomb threat at the state Capitol was sentenced Wednesday to one year in jail, Attorney General Dana Nessel said. Michael Varrone, 49, of Charlotte pleaded guilty last month to false report or threat of bomb/harmful device. Prosecutors dismissed two terrorism charges against him. Judge James Jamo sentenced Varrone to one year in the Ingham County Jail with no possibility of early release and three years’ probation, Nessel said. Varrone must also undergo mental health treatment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: Workers at the largest sugar beet processor in the U.S. have rejected a contract offer that includes a 17% pay increase over four years. Union President John Riskey said the offer from American Crystal Sugar was recently rejected by an overwhelming margin, but he did not provide details on how many members voted or the margin of rejection. The Moorhead-based cooperative said it negotiated for 10 days with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union. The company said in addition to the pay increase, the contract offered more vacation, increased pension benefits and a $1,000 ratification bonus if the new contract was approved by Sunday, when the current contract expires. Riskey said workers felt they deserved a bigger pay increase after helping the company weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Riskey said workers want contract talks to continue, Minnesota Public Radio reported. American Crystal said the new deadline for an agreement is Sept. 15. It agreed to continuing contract talks with a federal mediator.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a deadly bacteria has been found in environmental samples on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The discovery of the bacteria is the first in the U.S. According to a CDC release, a person on the coast was diagnosed with melioidosis in 2020, a rare disease caused by a bacteria known as Burkholderia pseudomallei. A second person living in close geographic proximity was diagnosed with the disease in 2022. The cases prompted state health officials and the CDC to take samples and test household products, soil and water in and around both patients’ homes, with permission. The bacteria was found in samples of soil and standing water. How long it has been on the coast and its spatial distribution isn’t known, but the CDC said conditions are conducive to its growth along all Gulf Coast states. The CDC said an average of 12 cases of the disease occur annually in the U.S., but according to state epidemiologist Paul Byers, most of those cases are the result of travel to countries where the bacteria have been known to occur. Melioidosis has a wide range of nonspecific symptoms such as fever, joint pain and headaches and can cause conditions that include pneumonia, abscess formation or blood infections. Worldwide, melioidosis is fatal in 10% to 50% of those infected, according to the CDC.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city’s Department of Workforce Development has been awarded a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor that will run through 2026. The grant money will go toward bolstering registered apprenticeship programs during the ongoing labor shortage. The Department of Workforce Development was one of 30 organizations nationwide, and the only one in Missouri, to be awarded this grant funding, according to a news release.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Montana posted 2,320 newly reported COVID-19 cases in the last week and the state’s total active confirmed reports stand at 2,199, with 109 active hospitalizations, according to the state website. Cascade County reported 192 new cases, bringing the actives cases to 205. One death has been reported, a male in his 80s, vaccinated but not boosted, with underlying health conditions. The community level in Cascade County has dropped from high to medium this week. Benefis Hospital reported 14 hospitalized by the virus.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpringfield: Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced plans Thursday to expand a data center it is building in the Omaha suburbs. A Meta spokesperson said the social media giant now plans to build a ninth building in the complex it is constructing in Papillion and Springfield southwest of Omaha in Sarpy County. The company said the data center will cost more than $1.5 billion and eventually include 4 million square feet. Meta plans to complete the project it began in 2017 by the end of 2024. About 150 people are maintaining computers at the site that is expected to employ about 300. Six of the nine buildings are operational. Meta said all of the data center’s electricity will come from renewable energy, including wind farms in northeast Nebraska and Kansas. Several other major companies have built data centers in the area around the Meta data center, including Google, Yahoo, Travelers Insurance and Fidelity Investments.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Parents and students will again be faced with an alternating bus schedule when school starts on Aug. 15 as the Washoe County School District struggles with staffing shortages. Bus routes will be suspended for one week on a rotating basis in each of the district’s five service areas. The calendar for bus rotation schedules is available on the district’s website. Additional student transportation bus information will be available on Aug. 5. Students in remote areas will continue to have daily bus service, said Adam Searcy, chief facilities management officer, during a school board meeting Tuesday. Those neighborhoods are: Rancho Haven, Antelope Valley, Hungry Valley, Palomino Valley, Nixon, Wadsworth and Natchez. Buses designated for special education students will continue in full operation, as required by federal law. Searcy said additional neighborhoods will return to daily transportation as more bus drivers become available. Bus drivers will be sent to work in areas with the greatest need. Families will be given advance notice before returning to the daily transportation system. Searcy added he hopes the entire school district will return to a daily transportation system by fall break.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A woman has pleaded guilty to charges she sold unapproved drugs on her website that claimed to be remedies and treatments for COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Justice said. U.S. Attorney Jane E. Young said in a news release that Diana Daffin, 69, of Charlotte, North Carolina, pleaded guilty Wednesday to selling unapproved drugs with the intent to defraud or mislead the Food and Drug Administration. In February 2021, Daffin sold an undercover law enforcement officer a product advertised as a drug that could cure, mitigate, treat and prevent COVID-19 in humans. Daffin later sold and shipped that drug and other unapproved drugs to the undercover agent, according to prosecutors. Daffin is scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 2.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Officials from the Golden Nugget will negotiate Thursday with Atlantic City’s main casino workers union on a new contract that would guarantee the seaside gambling resort labor peace for four years. The Golden Nugget is the only one of Atlantic City’s nine casinos without a new deal with Local 54 of the Unite Here union. The sides were expected to negotiate Thursday morning, and the likelihood of a deal appears high given the fact that the rest of the city’s casinos have agreed to new pacts. Thursday’s session followed the successful completion of negotiations Wednesday with Resorts casino on a new contract that contains the same economic elements as those reached with other casinos. Housekeeping employees will see their pay increase to $22 an hour at the end of the four-year contract. In addition to raises, the agreements maintain fully funded family health care and pension benefits, language that protects jobs and increases work opportunities, and new technology protections, the union said. The union has authorized a strike on Saturday if a new contract is not reached with Golden Nugget.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities have identified the bodies of three people who died in fast-moving floodwaters in Tecolote Canyon in northern New Mexico. San Miguel County sheriff’s officials said the victims were members of a West Texas family and were swept away last week during monsoon rains in mountainous terrain scorched by a 533-square mile wildfire. They said the three from Hale County were identified as 62-year-old Jimmy Chris Cummings, his 62-year-old wife Linda Jane Cummings and her 84-year-old mother Betty Greenhaw. Authorities said the women’s bodies were discovered in Tecolote Creek floodwaters July 22 near their truck, which also had been swept from the cabin the family owned. The body of Jimmy Cummings was found Tuesday within debris left by the flood in the creek, according to sheriff’s officials. The cabin the family owned in Tecolote Canyon on Camp Blue Haven property for more than 60 years was destroyed by the floodwaters.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: New York is inching toward becoming the first U.S. city to charge motorists an extra fee for entering its most congested areas. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said a long-delayed environmental assessment should be released by federal regulators next month, to be followed by public hearings. The MTA also named the members of a board that will decide the plan’s pricing, discounts and exemptions. The practice is commonly referred to as congestion pricing and has been used in cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm. In New York, motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street would be charged a toll electronically. The revenue, estimated at $1 billion annually, would be used to back borrowing for capital improvements to the MTA’s subway and bus systems. The tolls aren’t expected to be implemented until late next year at the earliest. Some lawmakers in New Jersey have said the plan is unfair because motorists already pay tolls at bridges and tunnels to enter New York, and the money from congestion pricing won’t be used to improve public transit in New Jersey. Some motorists paying tolls to enter Manhattan from New Jersey are expected to receive discounts or be exempt.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of people convicted of felonies but who aren’t behind bars can now register to vote and cast ballots following an appeals court ruling. Expanding the scope of those able to register and vote began Wednesday, the State Board of Elections said – the day after local elections were held in more than a dozen localities. The change proceeds from litigation challenging a 1973 law that prevents someone convicted of a felony from having voting rights restored while they are still on probation, parole or post-release supervision. A panel of trial judges struck down the law in March, declaring it violates the state constitution largely because it discriminates against Black residents. The state Supreme Court agreed in May to hear an appeal of that decision, and the case remains pending. But the justices didn’t touch a Court of Appeals ruling that prevented registration requests from the felons who weren’t in prison or jail from being fulfilled only through Tuesday. So these applicants – for now and unless the Supreme Court reverses the trial court ruling – will be able to vote, starting with the November general election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A judge put on hold the state’s trigger law banning abortion while a lawsuit moves forward that argues it violates the state constitution, ruling the attorney general had prematurely calculated the date when the ban should take effect. Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick sided with the state’s only abortion clinic, the Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, that Attorney General Drew Wrigley “prematurely attempted to execute” the trigger language. The clinic had argued that a 30-day clock should not have started until the U.S. Supreme Court issued its certified judgment on Tuesday. The ban had been set to take effect on Thursday. Shortly after the ruling, Wrigley said he was heading to the North Dakota Legislative Council’s office to drop off another certification of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that reversed Roe vs. Wade. He did not comment about the judge’s order. North Dakota’s law would make abortion illegal in the state except in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A man accused of raping and impregnating a 10-year-old Ohio girl who traveled to Indiana for an abortion was ordered held without bond Thursday by a judge who cited overwhelming evidence and the fact he apparently is living in the U.S. illegally. Gerson Fuentes, 27, faces two counts of raping the girl, who turned 10 before having the abortion in a case that has become a flashpoint in the national discussion about access to the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Fuentes, who is from Guatemala, faces the possibility of life in prison with no chance of parole. That penalty and “not having any ties to this community that can be proved legally makes it a substantial flight risk,” Franklin County Judge Julie Lynch said after a 35-minute hearing. The girl confirmed that Fuentes attacked her, Fuentes confessed to Columbus police detectives and DNA testing of the aborted fetus confirmed Fuentes was the father, Franklin County Prosecutor Dan Meyer and Detective Jeffrey Huhn said in court Thursday. Huhn said he was unable, when searching multiple databases, to find any evidence that Fuentes was in the country legally. Fuentes’ attorney, Bryan Bowen, argued against a no-bond hearing and unsuccessfully asked Lynch to set a reasonable bond. He said there was no evidence of physical abuse outside of the rapes or that the girl had been put under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He also said Fuentes had family ties in Columbus, that he had a job, and that there was no evidence of a criminal history. Fuentes has lived in the area about seven years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The second half of Scissortail Park will open Sept. 23, with events running that weekend from Friday night to Sunday night. The park will be the relaxed counterpart to the more heavily programmed upper portion, and at the same time be a place for children to play soccer, basketball, futsal and pickleball. MAPS 4 Program Manager David Todd said construction crews just have “finishing touches” left before the park is ready for its first visitors. The upper and lower portions of the park were funded by the voter-approved MAPS 3 penny sales tax, which ran from April 2010 to December 2017. The price tag for the park’s lower portion is now $24.5 million, a 9.5% increase over the original $22.2 million budget. The increase was paid for through higher-than-expected sales tax collections. The park project broke ground in November 2020.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A new audit from the Secretary of State has found Oregon’s unemployment insurance system experienced many problems during the pandemic, delaying payments to thousands of workers who lost jobs. The audit highlights known issues including the Employment Department’s antiquated and inflexible computer system and frequent turnover in its executive ranks. Previous audits warned that the agency’s mainframe system, dating to the 1990s, was too rigid to handle complicated claims or rule changes, and relied too much on manual processes, leading to errors. A 2015 audit recommended the system be replaced – a process that is only now underway.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Four Pennsylvania universities said they will follow through with tuition increases despite calls from state House Republicans to roll back the price hikes. The lawmakers, including Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, the GOP nominee for governor, argued Penn State, the University of Pittsburgh, Lincoln and Temple are receiving federal funds and do not need to increase tuition. The universities did not receive a bump in funding in this year’s state budget. Instead, through one-time federal funds, the universities will split about $30 million on top of budget funding. At Penn State, in-state undergraduate students will see tuition increase by 5% at the University Park campus and 2% at the Commonwealth Campuses. Nonresidents will see a 6% tuition increase at University Park and a 3% increase at the Commonwealth campuses. A 5% increase will be instituted for Penn State World Campus undergraduates. Most in-state students paying full tuition at Pitts’ campus will see their tuition rate rise by 3.5%. Regional campus tuition rates will rise by 2%. Temple students will see a 3.9% increase for 2022–2023 undergraduate and graduate base tuition for in-state and out-of-state students. Lincoln’s tuition will increased by less than 1% for the incoming class, according to figures on its website. A university spokesperson didn’t immediately confirm the increase amount.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket:As primary elections near, the city agreed to halt the enforcement of an ordinance restricting the placement of political signs in yards more than 30 days before an election as the parties work out a resolution in the case. The city reached a consent agreement with the state affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union before a court hearing Thursday not to enforce limitations on timing, lighting and size of political yard signs. Under the agreement, the city will not enforce, nor threaten to enforce, “any size, placement, and/or illumination restrictions on political campaign signs, including but not limited to candidate campaign signs or issue signs, that are more stringent than those imposed on nonpolitical signs.” The ordinance had also specified that signs could not be illuminated or exceed 12 square feet. The ACLU sued the city Tuesday on behalf of two Democratic candidates for state legislature – Jennifer Stewart and Cherie Cruz – arguing the ordinance banning the posting of political yard signs more than 30 days before an election was unconstitutional and should be struck down.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Turning around the state’s chronically dangerous juvenile prisons is now the job of Eden Hendrick, a prosecutor who sent some of those children to jail. Hendrick is leading the state Department of Juvenile Justice after two of her predecessors resigned following state audits that found major faults, from a “useless and ineffective” in-house police force to an inability to keep children safe. “We’ve been fighting this battle for a long time,” Hendrick said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I’m very hopeful that now that it’s actually getting some traction, and that we’ll be able to actually start to provide these youths the real services that they need.” Hendrick was confirmed in May shortly before the agency agreed to sweeping reforms at the main juvenile prison. Fixes included installing a modern surveillance system, revising use of force rules, reducing solitary confinement and making sure children get physical and recreational activity. Hendrick, who took over as interim director in September, is asking for time, to change the prisons and the culture of an agency whose employees often feel forgotten and unappreciated.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The proposed budget for the Aberdeen School District is up 3.3% from a year ago, and COVID-19 grant funding is a major reason why. That money will allow for the construction of a greenhouse and new classrooms at the A-TEC Academy on the Central High School campus. Finance Director Tom Janish presented the proposed budget for 2022-23 to the Aberdeen School Board during this week’s meeting. The board heard about the preliminary budget in May. The final budget has to be approved at the end of September. Until then, the school board can make adjustments. For the 2022-23 school year, the overall budget is projected at $59.38 million, with about $10 million going toward the the capital outlay fund and special education fund. Another $33.5 million is for the general fund, with the remaining dollars going toward debt service, food service and other areas. Overall, the general fund will see a 3.3% increase. The state's contribution to the general fund is going up about 6% to $18.77 million. That's about 56% of total general fund revenue, Janish said. Most of the rest of the money will come from property taxes.\n\nTennessee\n\nCharleston: A German chemical company plans to add 200 jobs through an expansion at its Tennessee campus. The state Department of Economic and Community Development said Wacker has begun a feasibility study to add new silicone production facilities in Charleston. A $200 million investment there would be phased over several years. The company employs 700 people at the site. The first phase of the expansion would add plants to produce high-consistency silicone rubber and silicone sealants. In 2015, Wacker began producing hyper-pure polysilicon for semi-conductor and high-efficiency solar cells. In 2019, Wacker added production of pyrogenic silica. With the new announcement, the company will have invested nearly $3 billion at the site.\n\nTexas\n\nGlen Rose: A wildfire that blackened 101/ 2 square miles of north Texas, destroying 16 homes, reached 40% containment Wednesday, double what it had been the day before, officials said. The multiagency firefighting team fighting the Chalk Mountain Fire 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth said it had completed a fire line around the blaze Wednesday. However, the lines are sufficient only to be impervious to further spreading in 40% of the fire zone, primarily its southern reaches. In a statement, team officials said work continues to improve the lines around the rest of the zone while also attacking stubborn hot spots within the zone’s interior. No injuries have been reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A stormy day of rain helped firefighters battling the Dodge Springs Fire near the Utah-Nevada border on Monday, but the fire was still just 10% contained and threatened to flare back up if winds and hotter temperatures persisted, officials said. The fire, which was burning in Washington County about 25 miles northwest of St. George, began July 22, sparked by a lightning strike. It was burning through pinyon pines and juniper trees in rough terrain that was difficult for firefighters to access but remote enough that there had been no evacuations or road closures.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:LandAir, the trucking firm with facilities in Williston and Windsor that closed unexpectedly earlier this month, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, meaning it will not be reorganized but will be liquidated. The company has about $3 million in assets and about $43 million in debts, according to documents filed in federal bankruptcy court in Massachusetts, where LandAir is based. Only two creditors have secured claims – Banc of California for $5 million and Corbel Capital Partners, the Los Angeles-based private investment firm that owned the company, for nearly $34 million. There are hundreds of unsecured creditors across the country, which include many Vermont companies. In addition, brothers Thomas and William Spencer, whose father Fred founded what would become LandAir in Burlington in 1968 as Allied Air Freight, are owed $137,500 each as the result of a lawsuit. The brothers’ attorney declined to comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: The Chincoteague Pony Swim returned Wednesday morning for the first time since the pandemic. The move of the ponies across the Assateague Channel is a 97-year tradition attended by enthusiastic spectators, many of whom arrived hours early to claim the best spots. Shortly after 9 a.m., a red-orange flare shot up from a Coast Guard boat, signaling to the group of horseback riders known as the Saltwater Cowboys that it was time to bring the ponies across the channel. The ponies didn’t want to be hurried, though, and paused to nibble on grass in the shallow water at the start of their journey. The ponies were submerged up to their necks, water churning as they made their way across the channel. It was over in 41/ 2 minutes. The swim raises money to buy equipment for the fire department, pays the roughly $45,000 yearly vet bill for the ponies and funds eight scholarships for Chincoteague high schoolers, said Denise Bowden, a spokeswoman for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. After the swim, about 65 foals were auctioned. It’s important to reduce the population of the horses because the fire department has an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to keep only 150 ponies on Assateague, Bowden said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People in the state’s most populous county should soon be able to drop off unwanted guns and ammunition at any sheriff’s office or storefront location, assured of its safe disposal. The Metropolitan King County Council unanimously approved legislation Tuesday to create a permanent program within its Sheriff’s Office that allows people to voluntarily return firearms and ammunition, The Seattle Times reported. The legislation asks the county executive to evaluate the feasibility of allowing drop offs and allowing people to request a sheriff’s deputy to pick up an unwanted firearm. People also could drop off guns at locations in the 10 contract cities where the county sheriff provides police services. And the legislation asks the sheriff to look for partnerships with other cities to expand access for people looking to turn over guns or ammunition. During a 2013 gun buyback program coordinated by King County and the city of Seattle, 716 firearms were surrendered to law enforcement in exchange for gift cards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The deadline to apply for the school clothing allowance has been extended because of a system outage that is affecting multiple state agencies, the Department of Health and Human Resources said. Children who are eligible will receive a $200 benefit each to buy school clothing or piece goods to sew clothing. Families can apply online at wvpath.org, and applications are due by 5 p.m. Aug. 12. Local DHHR offices can supply paper applications, which must be postmarked by Aug. 12. Automatic benefits will go to families with school-age children by the end of June who receive WV WORKS cash assistance; parents or guardians of children in foster care; and children ages 4 to 18 who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, are enrolled in school and whose household income is under 130% of the federal poverty level.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative law firm is pushing back against a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that transparency advocates said has damaged the state’s open records law by limiting when people who sue over records requests can recover attorney’s fees. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on Thursday called for the Republican-controlled Legislature to strengthen open records laws in response to a 4-3 ruling earlier this month by the conservative-controlled Supreme Court that found that if an entity decides to release records after being sued, the requester can be awarded attorney’s fees only if a court issues a ruling, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. In a policy brief, WILL urged the Legislature to amend state law to ensure that requesters will be able to recover attorney’s fees if they prevail in open records lawsuits. The brief offered multiple suggestions for how to amend the law.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An accident involving the aerial tram at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort on Saturday left a contractor severely injured, the Casper Star Tribune reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/04/pothole-protest-ernie-pyle-urine-scare-news-around-states/40758581/", "title": "Pothole protest, Ernie Pyle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: City officials are considering new curfew laws during school hours to try to discourage students from skipping class. The Tuscaloosa City Council’s public safety committee approved a proposal that would make it illegal for minors to be unaccompanied in public from 9 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. any Monday through Friday that city schools are in session. The Tuscaloosa News reports the full council will consider the curfew next month. If it’s approved, a parent could be cited if a minor is found in violation. City Attorney Glenda Webb says the penalties could include up to a $500 fine and up to six months in jail. The curfew wouldn’t apply to children who are homeschooled or attending other types of school programs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials say assessments following an enormous 2018 earthquake showed building damage was worse outside the city’s safety area due to reduced regulation. The Anchorage Daily News reports there was less structure damage in the Anchorage Building Safety Service Area than in the Chugiak-Eagle River area during the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in November 2018. Anchorage municipal officials say 52 red tags indicating severe building damage preventing occupation were issued in Chugiak-Eagle River, while only 17 were issued in Anchorage. Officials say builders outside the safety area can hire private inspectors and do not need to have plans reviewed. Proponents of the independent inspection process say the model is equally effective as the system in the safety area and less expensive for homebuyers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state lawmaker wants to require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, but the ACLU claims such a requirement is unconstitutional. Rep. John Fillmore, R-Apache Junction, has proposed legislation requiring schools to set aside time each day for the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of quiet reflection. House Bill 2017 would strike existing law that allows time for “those students who wish” to recite the pledge. Only a parent could excuse a student from the requirement under Fillmore’s proposal. But ACLU Arizona claims that ordering students to recite the pledge unless a parent allows them to refuse is unconstitutional, spokeswoman Marcela Taracena said in a written statement. Similar requirements in other states have led to conflict in the classroom and in the courtroom.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Officials say they may consider revoking medical marijuana licenses for dispensaries that aren’t open by June. Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials regulate the state’s budding cannabis industry. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that that those officials say they could begin taking action against inoperable dispensaries at the end of January. But a necessary rule is still being drafted and won’t be ready by then. Officials have said licenses may not be reissued when they are up for renewal in June. Marijuana commissioners have expressed frustration at how long it is taking the 32 dispensaries in the state to open since being licensed this year. Only 11 are operating. Attorney Alex Gray represents several dispensaries. He says cannabis companies have been weighing patient count, product supply and locations of other dispensaries.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Los Angeles Police Department will begin testing a device designed to snare a person from a distance, giving officers an alternative to firing a Taser or a gun. The Los Angeles Times reports department officials told the city Police Commission that officers will start testing the tool for free for 90 days beginning in January. The BolaWrap 100 fires a Kevlar cord that wraps around a person 10 to 25 feet away. The device will be distributed to 200 LAPD officers once they are trained. The Times says dozens of police departments across the United States are testing or have purchased the devices.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The first head shop in this state at the forefront of counterculture and legal marijuana plans to close with the new year. Mellow Yellow, a historic head shop that opened in 1969, will officially close its flagship Fort Collins location Jan.1, the store’s new owner Jake Myers confirmed Monday. “The Mellow’s 50 years old. It was the first shop of its kind,” says Myers, who has worked as Mellow Yellow’s general manager for the past five years. Myers says the store was the first head shop in Colorado when previous owner Jerry Weintraub opened it. Weintraub maintained ownership of the well-known shop and boutique since it opened before selling it to Myers two weeks ago, Myers says. He says the Fort Collins inventory will be moved to Mellow Yellow’s Greeley location, which opened in the 1980s.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: It’s unclear whether efforts next year to make the seasonal flu vaccine more accessible to children will get any traction. Given the anticipated debate about whether to end the state’s religious exemption from certain childhood vaccinations, the CEO of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association says his group doesn’t plan to push for a bill in the next regular legislative session that would allow young people to get a flu shot from a pharmacist. Nathan Tinker says concerns raised by parents skeptical about the safety of vaccines could impede efforts to make the flu vaccine more accessible. Groton Sen. Heather Somers, a Republican, says she still plans to resurrect the bill when lawmakers return in February. She says the legislation will save lives. Currently, pharmacists can only administer flu shots to adults.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state will host events throughout 2020 to mark the 100th anniversary of women’s right to vote in the United States. Delaware State News reports the planned celebrations include a march around Legislative Hall that will end with the erection of a monument honoring the women’s suffrage movement. The Women’s Suffrage Centennial Committee also plans to have historical markers installed in each county. A website about the fight for the women’s vote is also up and running.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Allan Gerson, a lawyer who pursued Nazi war criminals and pioneered the practice of suing foreign governments in U.S. courts for complicity to terrorism, has died at the age of 74. Gerson died Sunday at his D.C. home from complications of the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said his wife, author Joan Nathan, according to The Washington Post. Gerson wrote an opinion piece for the newspaper in 2017 in which he detailed his lengthy legal career and identified himself as a former “dreamer,” drawing a parallel between his undocumented entry into the United States and those of immigrants currently targeted by the Trump administration. A deputy assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, Gerson was also a child of Jewish refugees who fled Poland during the Holocaust.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state’s Democratic and Republican parties are united in opposing a proposed constitutional amendment that would let all voters cast ballots in primary elections. Lawyers for both parties asked the state Supreme Court on Tuesday to keep the proposal off the 2020 ballot. The parties said the ballot language is confusing and misleading. A group called All Voters Vote gathered enough signatures to have the item placed on next November’s ballot, but the court has to decide whether that ballot language is clear. If the proposal passes, all voters will be eligible to vote in primary elections for the Legislature, governor and Cabinet. The top two candidates would then move on to the general election, even if they’re from the same party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man considered the main suspect in a string of killings of black children and young adults in the city in the 1970s and 1980s has been denied parole. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles made the decision last month in the case of 61-year-old Wayne Williams. The more than two dozen killings, mostly of black boys, terrorized Atlanta from 1979 to 1981. Williams was sentenced in 1982 to serve two life prison sentences after being convicted of murder in the killings of two adults. While authorities blamed him for the other killings, he was never charged. A Nov. 20 parole board letter to Williams says he hasn’t served enough time given the “nature and circumstances” of his offenses. The board set his next parole consideration for November 2027.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The on-time graduation rate for University of Hawaii at Manoa students has doubled in the past decade. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the school’s graduation rate now matches the national average for public universities. The University of Hawaii Institutional Research & Analysis Office says the four-year graduation rate reached 36.6% for the class of 2019, up from 17.5% in 2010. The National Center for Education Statistics reports the national rate for public universities was 32.9% in 2010 and 36.9% in 2017. The figures represent first-time, full-time freshmen who graduate from the institution where they originally enrolled. Officials at Hawaii’s flagship campus say the university won an Association of Public and Land Grant Universities national award in 2017 for success in increasing graduation rates, which have continued to climb.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: State lawmakers have announced a new law targeting uninsured drivers by suspending vehicle registration is expected to take effect Jan. 1. The Post Register reports the state Department of Motor Vehicles can now cross-check vehicle identification numbers each month against its database of registered vehicles. Transportation officials say that means drivers who don’t keep insurance on their vehicles could see their registration suspended after a few months. Officials say uninsured drivers would receive a notice after two months saying they have 30 days to get insurance. Officials say it would cost $75 and proof of insurance to reinstate vehicle registration if it’s revoked. Idaho Falls police say officers wrote 609 tickets for failure to provide proof of insurance and 139 tickets for failure to maintain insurance last year.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A tax on parking places to help finance a $45 billion, statewide construction plan has lawmakers taking a second look. The State Journal-Register reports that the tax, which takes effect Jan. 1, is 9% on spaces that are rented by the month or year. It’s 6% for spaces rented hourly, daily or weekly. It will raise $60 million annually and is part of more than $800 million in new taxes and fees that will finance state construction. But proposed rules would make the tax so broad that even those who rent private property for parking – as dozens in Springfield do annually in August during the Illinois State Fair – would pay the tax. Springfield Republican Rep. Tim Butler suggested reviewing the tax because of difficulty in enforcing it.\n\nIndiana\n\nDana: Republican U.S. Sens. Todd Young and Mike Braun have introduced legislation to rename the post office in Dana after Ernie Pyle, the celebrated war correspondent who was born near the western Indiana town. Pyle was reporting on the U.S. Army’s 305th Infantry Regiment when he was killed April 18, 1945, on the Japanese island of le Shima. Braun said last week that “Ernie Pyle is an American hero who gave his life in World War II, and it’s only fitting to name the post office in Dana, Indiana, after him.” After studying journalism at Indiana University, Pyle won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on World War II. The bill was introduced last week.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: In the Labs for Functional Textiles and Protective Clothing at Iowa State University, professor Guowen Song and student researchers are working to improve upon some of the most basic gear for firefighters – heavy-duty gloves intended to protect against searing heat and sharp objects, and as a result too cumbersome for maneuverability. “The current gloves are not really designed to meet the basic elements of protection, comfort and functionality,” Song told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “Firefighters lose more than 50% of their manual dexterity while wearing these gloves, and that can create a risk to their safety.” The three-year project is funded through a $1.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A man who was banished from the state as a condition of a criminal plea deal could be allowed back under a deal struck Monday, civil rights advocates say. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas says it has agreed to drop a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of Bo Dana Rupert in exchange for an amended Montgomery County plea agreement in a related criminal case against him. Court transcripts show Rupert pleaded no contest in 2017 to three felony counts of making a criminal threat and three misdemeanor counts of filing a false report. He was sentenced to 12 months’ probation, and the judge accepted a plea agreement under which he was banished from the state – two apparently incongruous terms. Under the new settlement, Montgomery County Attorney Larry Markle agreed not to prosecute Rupert for fleeing the state, which Rupert contends he did to comply with the banishment terms.\n\nKentucky\n\nGolden Pond: Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area is offering free cedar Christmas tree permits. The permits are available online through Christmas Eve. Permits, maps and guidelines are available online. The permits are also available in person at the park’s Administrative Office from Monday through Friday during the same period. Permits allow the holder to cut one cedar tree in specific areas of the park. Rules and regulations are available on the reservations page. The park says no matter where you get your tree, be sure it’s fresh and isn’t dry because it could catch fire. Water the tree daily, and place away from heat sources. Be sure lights are in good condition.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s farmers have collected more than $180 million from President Donald Trump’s multibillion-dollar bailout package for farmers hurt by the United States’ trade war with China. The Advocate reports that U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show more than 75% of that aid went to Louisiana soybean farmers. But some farmers say the program hasn’t been enough to cover their costs. They’re questioning whether they’ll continue to grow soybeans next year because the federal aid package isn’t offsetting all their losses. Soybeans are a major agricultural product in Louisiana, with a farm value of $800 million, second only to sugar cane. China is the biggest buyer of American soy.\n\nMaine\n\nBuxton: The town’s police say they need the public’s help locating feral pigs, if there are any living in the area. Buxton police ask that anyone who sees the pigs lurking in town should immediately contact the animal control officer. The Portland Press Herald reports the federal government has called on communities in Maine and elsewhere to report sightings of feral pigs or escaped domesticated hogs. Feral pigs represent a major invasive species problem around the country, but they haven’t yet been seen in Maine. They cause crop damage and can ruin private and public property. The public can report any sightings by calling Buxton police at 207-629-5178.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is now a member of the U.S. Naval Academy’s Board of Visitors. Spicer was sworn in Monday during a board meeting in Annapolis. The board reviews the state of morale and discipline at the academy and its curriculum and fiscal affairs. It includes members of Congress. Spicer holds a master’s degree from the Naval War College in Rhode Island. He served as press secretary for President Donald Trump when he came into office. He resigned from the job in July 2017. The president announced in July that he was nominating Spicer to serve on the board.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: The birthplace of the second president of the United States is undergoing restoration work. The Patriot Ledger reports a small historic home in Quincy where John Adams was born in 1735 had been buried under scaffolding as construction workers prepared to replace the south- and west-facing sides of the house. Kevin Kelly, facilities manager for the John Adams Birthplace, says the siding has not been replaced since 1984, and the restoration work is “greatly needed.” The home was built in 1722 by the former president’s father, Deacon John Adams. Kelly says the construction and restoration is expected to be completed before the national park reopens in May. The project is expected to cost $100,000 and will be funded by visitor fees.\n\nMichigan\n\nHickory Corners: A museum that boasts the largest vintage automobile collection in North America plans to open a new building to display muscle cars. The $5 million project at the Gilmore Car Museum would add more than 25,000 square feet of exhibit space. The groundbreaking is set for next year, with plans to open the new addition by 2021. Stacie Longwell Sadowski, the museum’s development and engagement manager, says the popularity of previous muscle car exhibits sparked the idea for the expansion. The museum in rural southwest Michigan currently has 20 muscle cars on display, which is expected to double. The Gilmore Car Museum says it has more than 500 vehicles, and the oldest car on exhibit is an 1899 Locomobile Steam Car.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: Bob and Corrine Johnson got married as teens in southern Minnesota’s farm country and lived together for 68 years. KARE-TV reports they were to be laid to rest Tuesday – after dying 33 hours apart. They lived in their farm home near St. Peter until six months ago. After Bob was hospitalized with cancer, Corrine joined him there with congestive heart failure. He was 88. She was 87. One of their seven children, Dr. Bruce Johnson, says his father went downhill as soon as his mother died Nov. 24 and passed the next day. He says it’s hard to imagine it was a coincidence. Son Brent Johnson says his father always put others first, so it was only fitting that he waited for his mother to go first.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: Residents are protesting a large pothole in their neighborhood by decorating it with holiday cheer. The Enterprise-Journal reports people in the Edgewood neighborhood have topped the pothole and its yellow traffic cone with tinsel, spray-painted pinecones, white leaves and what appear to be holly berries. The newspaper says residents plan to add lights and presents in the hopes of drawing the city’s attention. It’s unclear how long the pothole has gone unattended by the city or what drove residents to start cheerfully protesting it recently.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State officials are buying a piece of equipment that simulates the experience of being in an earthquake to prepare residents for a big tremblor in a region that saw one of the most powerful earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains in the 1800s. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the nearly $200,000 simulator is built into a large cargo trailer decorated like a small house. Special hydraulics shake it violently for 5 to 10 seconds, giving riders the feel of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. It also illustrates how pictures and other household items can become projectiles if not properly secured. Armed with federal funding, the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency submitted documents last month seeking a no-bid contract to purchase the simulator. The plan is to use a two-person team to take the unit through the Bootheel region, where the New Madrid fault is located.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State trust lands produced nearly $100 million in revenue for education and other recipients from July 2018 through June 2019. The $99.2 million in revenue from forestry, minerals, agriculture and real estate was up about $12 million from fiscal year 2018. However, it’s still well below the $188 million brought in in fiscal year 2010. The revenues dipped as low as $86 million in FY2017. The Independent Record reports the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation gave a ceremonial check for $46 million to Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen. The amount is about 5.5% of the Office of Public Instruction’s $840 million budget. Other money goes to the university system, the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind, the Montana Veterans Home and public buildings.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Nearly 800 Nebraska State Penitentiary inmates – more than half the Lincoln prison’s population – have signed a petition sent to state officials and various news outlets decrying conditions at the prison. The Lincoln Journal Star reports the petition pans administrators for putting the prison in modified lockdown. Because of the lockdown, meetings of self-betterment clubs or organizations have been limited or eliminated, and inmates have seen their use of the prison law library restricted. That restriction, the petition says, impedes prisoners’ access to the courts, attorneys, legislators, judges and other legal sources. The petition also cites multiple changes in policies, procedures, rules, memorandums, protocols and inmate movement as problems.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Environmentalists are warning that a planned geothermal energy plant in northern Nevada could threaten the habitat of a rare toad. The future of a big-eyed, freckled creature known as the Dixie Valley toad is at the center of an expected fight as environmentalists seek federal protection for the amphibian, the Las Vegas Sun reports. The toad, whose existence was unknown until a couple of years ago, lives around the thermal springs on the western edge of the Dixie Valley Playa, east of Reno. Ormat Technologies, the company that plans to build the geothermal energy plant, has proposed mitigation strategies to protect the toad’s habitat. The Dixie Valley toad’s habitat is restricted to fewer than 2.3 square miles, which makes it particularly vulnerable, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Some counties in the Granite State are cutting back as demand for Meals on Wheels and other food programs for seniors exceeds funding. As of Sunday, the Grafton County Senior Citizens Council had eliminated dessert to save money after state and federal funding ran out. The nonprofit group has had to dip into its reserves to make up for a $125,000 shortfall. The Valley News reports that seven of the 10 agencies providing home-delivered meals in New Hampshire have faced deficits. Strafford Nutrition & Meals on Wheels eliminated Wednesday deliveries years ago and is looking at other measures as demand grows, such as cutting night meals. The Community Action Program for Belknap and Merrimack counties is also looking at options. It already has stopped delivering breakfast as a way to cut costs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFort Lee: The centerpiece of the city’s holiday tree lighting has grown from a Charlie Brown tree to a 35-foot showstopper. The festivities now draw nearly 5,000 people. And employees start to decorate as early as the summer. This year’s tree lighting Thursday is expected to be the biggest yet, with a holiday carnival, bonfires, snow and, of course, Santa. The event takes place at the Fort Lee Community Center from 7 to 9 p.m. Besides the tree lighting, the community center becomes its own attraction, with nearly every inch of the building covered in 400,000 lights. The night will also include hot chocolate, a holiday carnival, a DJ, carnival rides, animated characters, snow machines, and a choreographed light and music show. Santa Claus will arrive on a Fort Lee firetruck.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A team of researchers is getting federal funding to analyze perishable artifacts to better understand the early inhabitants who lived in and around caves in southeastern New Mexico and West Texas. Officials say the region is under-researched, and the $200,000 grant from the Bureau of Land Management will help fund more work in the Guadalupe Mountains. The University of New Mexico is partnering with the Lincoln National Forest, the New Mexico Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and the Carlsbad Museum and Art Center. The team will use existing museum collections to build a chronology of basket and sandal styles used by those who lived in the area centuries ago. They also will re-document two of the area’s rock shelter sites with new technologies, including a drone and photogrammetric mapping.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A federal judge has barred the state’s prison agency from taking any “adverse action” against correctional officers seeking a religious beard accommodation. The order signed last week is tied to a federal lawsuit filed in August and comes after additional correctional officers accused the prison department of discrimination in its handling of religious beards. Their concerns were outlined in court filings. The lawsuit argues the state prison agency discriminated against two Muslim correctional officers who were suspended over their beards. Attorney Joshua Moskovitz says the judge’s order prevents the agency from retaliating or harassing correctional officers who have a religious accommodation for beards or have applied for one with the agency.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMaggie Valley: An elk has been running around western North Carolina with a shredded hammock on its head, and apparently a love of apples is to blame. News outlets report Jim Beaver told the Haywood County Sheriff’s Office on Thanksgiving that an elk was stuck in his yard with its antlers tangled up in a hammock. The sheriff’s office says on Facebook that Cpl. Ken Stiles climbed onto the roof, cut the hammock and freed the animal. Beaver says elks often eat apples in his yard and play with his hammock. This elk, however, was too playful. Beaver says he didn’t free the elk himself, in case it decided to attack. He told WLOS-TV that the elk, with pieces of the hammock still in its antlers, has returned to the house a few times.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A photo of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg at a Native American reservation in the state has been archived at the Library of Congress in Washington. Photographer Shane Balkowitsch preserved the image on a glass plate and titled it “Standing For Us All.” The method known as “wet plate collodion” involves wetting glass with various chemicals before inserting the plate into a camera and developing the photo. Balkowitsch told the Bismarck Tribune it’s his “most important work to date.” The photo shows 16-year-old Thunberg looking into the distance during a visit to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. She shared it on Twitter when she left North America on Nov. 13. Another image, a close-up of Thunberg’s face, will be featured at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: With the manmade chemicals known as PFAS – used in products including carpeting, cookware, microwave popcorn bags and firefighting foam – turning up in water and some foods across the U.S., Gov. Mike DeWine says the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency will coordinate the testing of nearly 1,500 public water systems serving communities, schools, day cares and mobile home parks. If the chemicals are detected, the EPA will work with public systems to reduce their levels. The state Health Department will also work with private water system owners on ways to reduce exposure and install treatment systems. The state hopes to complete sampling of public water systems by the end of next year.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s highest court admonished an Oklahoma County judge who failed to pay her taxes and more than 60 parking tickets, but it narrowly decided against filing a petition for her removal. In its 5-4 ruling Tuesday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined the allegations against District Judge Kendra Coleman didn’t warrant a trial to have her removed. In its order, the court admonished Coleman for neglecting to pay dozens of parking tickets and various tax obligations for several years. They also reprimanded her for failing to properly file campaign reports to the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. Coleman is facing a felony charge for failing to file state income tax returns. Neither Coleman nor her attorney returned telephone messages seeking comment.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Experts in this state that’s the nation’s No. 1 supplier of Christmas trees say prices for a holiday evergreen will remain higher this year due to a tight supply. Chal Landgren, with Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, says there are 400 fewer Oregon growers than there were 15 years ago, and land once used for Christmas trees is now being used for less labor-intensive crops. Many tree farms went out of business about a decade ago. On average, consumers paid $78 for a tree in 2018, up $3 from 2017. There are 383 licensed Christmas tree growers in Oregon who sell about 4.6 million trees a year. Most of those trees are sold in the Pacific Northwest, California, Nevada and Arizona. Mexico is the top international importer of Oregon trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLanghorne: The Neshaminy School District will appeal a state commission’s ruling that it can continue to call its sports teams “Redskins” but must remove logos that “negatively stereotype Native Americans.” The school district board voted 9-0 Monday night to appeal last month’s ruling by the state Human Relations Commission, which also ordered the district to educate students about Native Americans. In a statement, the Bucks County district accused the commission of “unsubstantiated allegations of racism” and ordering actions that could cost nearly $1 million. In 2013, the commission, citing a complaint, accused Neshaminy of violating a state human relations law. The high school’s baseball team hats feature a tomahawk, the basketball team’s logo is a profile of a Native American warrior, and the football team is known as the “Skins.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An anti-abortion group is saying it will appeal a decision by a Superior Court judge to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s abortion rights law passed this summer. The lawsuit was filed in June on behalf of Catholics for Life and other anti-abortion activists. They argued the law violates the state Constitution, which they said doesn’t guarantee the right to privacy for a woman seeking an abortion. The Providence Journal reports that after Judge Melissa Darigan dismissed the lawsuit Wednesday, an attorney for the anti-abortion activists tweeted that she plans to appeal the decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The Reproductive Privacy Act – signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo in June – codifies the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling into state law.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The head of the state’s child welfare agency is asking for $127 million more next year to help turn around an embattled agency criticized for failing children. Department of Social Services Director Michael Leach is asking the General Assembly to boost the budget to pay for staff salary increases and the hiring of more caseworkers. The State newspaper reports those are among several spending hikes Leach sought in his first budget request to lawmakers. State budget writers say they aren’t yet sold on spending millions to fix an agency that has been slow to show results. But legislators say they’re encouraged that Leach has shown an eagerness to change agency culture. The department has struggled for years with heavy caseloads, low morale and high turnover of child welfare workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Minnehaha County Commission has accepted the resignation of the county state’s attorney in the wake of an investigation for workplace misconduct. Aaron McGowan, a Democrat who held the office since 2009, offered his resignation this week, citing his health and reporting about his work absences. The attorney general investigated McGowan in September over his extended work absences and reported that some employees had told investigators of incidents involving McGowan and alcohol. One employee reported that McGowan’s behavior made her feel uncomfortable. The county will pay McGowan $35,000 as part of an agreement not to sue. Commission Chairwoman Jean Bender said she would not comment on personnel issues.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Capitol building is now lit for the holidays. Gov. Bill Lee and first lady Maria Lee celebrated “Christmas at the Capitol” on Monday night, overseeing the lighting of the large evergreen on display outside the Capitol building. The KIPP Academy choir from Nashville performed holiday songs before the tree lighting. The Lees then read “The Night Before Christmas” inside the Old Supreme Court Chamber inside the Capitol. The tree was donated by the Diane and Fay Hazen family from Maury County, said Laine Arnold, press secretary for Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct has issued a public warning to a judge who refuses to perform same-sex marriages. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports McLennan County Justice of the Peace Dianne Hensley has said her “Bible-believing” Christian conscience prohibits her from doing same-sex weddings. She believes she’s entitled to a “religious exemption.” Hensley has continued to perform opposite-sex weddings. In its order, the commission said Hensley is violating the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct by “casting doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person’s sexual orientation.” Hensley has 30 days to appeal the sanction. She and her attorney have both declined to comment on the commission’s warning.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The backlog of untested rape kits is growing in the state even after lawmakers passed a law in 2017 to address the issue, in part because of a lack of funding to hire an adequate number of technicians. The state crime lab asked for $2.4 million for 17 technicians but received $1.2 million to hire nine technicians, said Amy Lightfoot, the deputy director of the crime lab, KUTV-TV in Salt Lake City reports. “Unfortunately, what you’re looking at there is the result of a partially funded mandate,” Lightfoot said. The backlog sits at about 1,900 rape kits now. The state crime lab is on target to process an estimated 3,300 kits by July 2020, which would eliminate the backlog. The lab receives about 120 kits each month. She said the number of rape kits sent in has increased by 535% over the past six years.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont Health Department is offering a new resource to help people learn about how cannabis affects peoples’ bodies, minds and health. The department announced Monday that it had launched a site called “Let’s Talk Cannabis.” The site offers facts, tips and other resources for audiences that include youth and young adults, people who are breastfeeding, parents and health care professionals. The possession of up to an ounce of cannabis is legal in Vermont for people over age 21. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine says that as with all substance use, consumption of cannabis can be unhealthy. He says the site gives Vermonters the information they need to make safe and informed choices.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax County: Local firefighters are taking part in a study aimed at finding ways to reduce their exposure to carcinogens. WTOP-FM reports that the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department is partnering with the National Fire Protection Association Research Foundation on a four-phase study. Part of the focus of the study will be on how chemicals can cling to breathing equipment used by firefighters. Firefighters are exposed to toxic chemicals released into the air by burning buildings and vehicles. According to a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study, firefighters are twice as likely to get skin and testicular cancer and mesothelioma.\n\nWashington\n\nNorth Bend: A movie theater in this small city was evacuated after authorities say a package labeled as containing a “highly contagious human substance” was sent there in error. KOMO reports the package contained a urine sample. Sgt. Paul Graham with Snoqualmie Police says the package arrived at the theater late Friday, and the theater manager found a box with the labeled liquid inside. The theater was evacuated, and local streets were closed as hazmat crews responded. Graham says the package was supposed to have been delivered to a medical clinic in Tacoma. It was unclear how it ended up more than 40 miles away in North Bend. Snoqualmie Police provide police services to North Bend.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: The city’s Holiday of Lights festival has officially opened. The annual holiday display in Bluefield City Park went up last week and will run until the end of December. The decorations include more than 1.2 million lights throughout the park’s 40 acres. Hay rides, trolley rides and, of course, Santa are part of the festivities. There’s no cost to see the lights, but certain activities come with a $3 fee.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Feminine hygiene products are now available for free in bathrooms at state office buildings. Gov. Tony Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said Tuesday that the administration installed or converted menstrual product dispensers in state buildings, including the Capitol. She did not immediately have details on the cost or how many units were installed. Democratic state Rep. Melissa Sargent, of Madison, heralded the move as a win for all women who menstruate. Sargent has introduced bills for years to make tampons and sanitary napkins available for free in women’s bathrooms at state office buildings and schools. The bills have gone nowhere in the GOP-controlled Legislature. Sargent argues making the feminine hygiene products available is no different from having soap or toilet paper in any public bathroom.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Game and Fish Department says the number of state hunting and fishing licenses sold to women has seen a marked increase over the past decade. KGAB-AM reports that at the same time, men are buying slightly fewer hunting and fishing licenses. The agency says 30.5% more women are hunting in Wyoming compared to 10 years ago. Female anglers increased by 14.5% over that time. Meanwhile, the number of men participating in both activities is down by about 5%. Game and Fish Hunter and Angler Participation Coordinator Kathryn Boswell said the agency has been reaching out to women to get them more involved in outdoor activities, and women are starting to see hunting as an activity that is accessible to them.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/04"}]}

The 33-year-old appeared in just two games this season, throwing 5 2/3 innings. He suffered a broken left pinkie finger when he was hit by a line drive against the New York Yankees on July 17 and had surgery the next day. The start of his season was delayed after he broke a rib while working out on his own during the lockout.\n\n“We need to dispatch some people to go find whoever has the Chris Sale voodoo doll and recover it,” Bloom said.\n\nBloom said Sale rode his bike home from a throwing session on Saturday at Boston College near his home.

He missed the pandemic-shortened 2020 season because of Tommy John surgery and went 5-1 with a 3.16 ERA in nine starts last year. He’s logged only 14 starts, including three in the playoffs, over the past three seasons.\n\nHe is in the third year of a five-year, $145 million deal.\n\nThe Red Sox came within two wins of the World Series in 2021 but are last in the AL East thanks in part to injuries that have diminished both their starting rotation and regular lineup.

A section of federal code says anyone determined to have improperly removed government documents would be disqualified from holding federal office. In 2015, some Republicans wondered whether the law could be used to disqualify Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton from serving as president over her use of a private email server for official government business.

He's made four minor league rehab starts, allowing three earned runs in 11 1/3 innings and striking out 19.\n\nThe 33-year-old Sale is a seven-time All-Star and could be a big key to Boston's push for a playoff spot.\n\nAll-Star third baseman Rafael Devers also is likely to return for the Red Sox after missing three starts because of back discomfort.

Realmuto, Alec Bohm, Aaron Nola and Kyle Gibson during a two-game series in Toronto due to Canadian restrictions on unvaccinated travelers.\n\nNola started on the mound Monday night at St. Louis and was not scheduled to pitch against the Blue Jays. Bohm, an infielder, came out of Monday’s game with an apparent hand injury.\n\nPresident of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski told reporters before the game that the four players will be placed on the restricted list and forfeit two days of pay and major league service time in accordance with the terms of MLB’s collective bargaining agreement.\n\nSeveral teams have put players on the restricted list this year before trips to Toronto.\n\n3-PETE?\n\nNew York Mets slugger Pete Alonso will try to become the first player to win the All-Star Home Run Derby three straight times, and his competition is likely to be announced in the coming days.\n\nBraves star Ronald Acuña Jr. and Cardinals great Albert Pujols also confirmed Monday they'll be among the eight participants in the July 18 competition at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\n“It’s a really fun event, and it’s going to be super exciting,” Alonso said before the Mets beat Atlanta on Monday night. “I have a really good plan to go into it and, again, I have just so much fun. I don’t think anyone has more fun than I do, especially when it comes to this event.”\n\nAlonso hit 74 total home runs in last year’s Derby at Denver’s Coors Field and beat Baltimore’s Trey Mancini 23-22 in the final round. Alonso joined Ken Griffey Jr. (1998-99) and Yoenis Céspedes (2013-14) in winning consecutive titles. Griffey also won in 1994 and is the only three-time champion.\n\nThere was no Derby in 2020, when the All-Star Game scheduled for Dodger Stadium was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Alonso won the 2019 Derby at Cleveland as a rookie when he defeated Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\n\nARCH ENEMIES\n\nAfter winning the final seven games of a 10-1 homestand, Trea Turner, Mookie Betts and the Los Angeles Dodgers look to extend their winning streak when they hit the road. They visit Albert Pujols and the St. Louis Cardinals in the opener of a star-studded series between two of the National League’s most successful franchises.\n\nMitch White (1-1, 3.38 ERA) pitches for the NL West leaders against rookie left-hander Matthew Liberatore (2-1, 4.74).\n\nON THE RISE\n\nA couple of under-the-radar American League teams are quietly riding eight-game winning streaks.\n\nJordan Lyles (5-7, 4.50 ERA) and the Baltimore Orioles (43-44), last in the loaded AL East, can reach .500 for the first time since opening 4-4 last year with a road win at Wrigley Field over the Chicago Cubs, who have dropped four straight.\n\nThe Orioles had not won eight consecutive games in a season since 2005, though they won 12 straight across two seasons in late 2015 and early 2016.\n\n“We’re just having a really good time in here,” designated hitter Trey Mancini said.\n\nAll-Star rookie Julio Rodríguez and the Mariners go for their ninth victory in a row when they begin a two-game series at last-place Washington with Chris Flexen (5-8, 4.00 ERA) trying to win his fourth consecutive start.\n\nSeattle is 16-3 for its best 19-game stretch since 2003. Right back in the wild-card race, the Mariners (45-42) are looking to make the playoffs for the first time since 2001.\n\n“You can’t celebrate anything. We’re not there,” manager Scott Servais said. “But everybody knows the drought. It rains a lot in Seattle, so we’ve got to end the drought.”\n\nAILING RAYS\n\nAlready depleted by injuries, the Tampa Bay Rays will now be missing shortstop Wander Franco and center fielder Kevin Kiermaier for a while.\n\nFranco is set for surgery on his right wrist and expected to be sidelined for five to eight weeks. The 21-year-old Franco is hitting .260 with five homers and 23 RBIs in 58 games in the first season of a $182 million, 11-year contract.\n\nFranco missed a month earlier this season because of a quadriceps injury.\n\nThe 32-year-old Kiermaier is dealing with left hip inflammation. He will see a hip specialist in Tennessee after the All-Star break.\n\n“KK’s going to be down for some time,” manager Kevin Cash said. “We need to let the hip calm down and let the expert give his recommendation. KK might have a decision to make at that point.”\n\nKiermaier is batting .228 with seven homers and 22 RBIs in 63 games this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/fantasy/2022/03/30/fantasy-baseball-signings-trades-injuries-impact-draft-day-value/7208506001/", "title": "Fantasy baseball: Signings, trades, injuries impact draft-day value", "text": "One of the greatest impacts of the 99-day MLB lockout was the stress test it put on baseball fans by taking away all the fun of the Hot Stove season.\n\nThe impasse left us without the free agent signings, trades and enticing news nuggets that help bridge the gap between one season and the next. Thankfully, the owners and the players were able to reach an agreement to preserve a 162-game season and restore at least a semblance of normalcy.\n\nBut getting there required a flurry of transactions leading into a shortened spring training. And it could all be overwhelming for fantasy baseball managers to process.\n\nFortunately, there’s still time to catch our breath before opening day. As a refresher and draft primer, let’s highlight some important fantasy developments since the lockout ended.\n\nLOCKOUT IMPACT: What makes this season different for fantasy managers\n\nFANTASY RANKINGS: The top 200 overall players for 2022 (updated)\n\nBiggest downgrade\n\nThe baseball world felt a seismic jolt upon learning Fernando Tatis had broken his wrist over the winter. Perhaps in an alternate non-lockout universe, Tatis would have consulted with a team doctor, had surgery sooner and wouldn’t have to miss roughly half the regular season.\n\nDespite shoulder issues that required two separate stints on the injured list last season, Tatis was still a consensus top-five overall player in early drafts. Potentially missing time wasn’t that big a deal after he led the National League with 42 homers, despite playing in just 130 games.\n\nNow, there’s no consensus whatsoever. Maybe Tatis returns and is fully healthy for three months. Or maybe the wrist surgery saps his power and he’s forced to alter his swing (again). The threat of reinjury also looms. (I dropped him from No. 2 in my overall rankings to No. 128) For all of his pure talent, it may be best to avoid Tatis altogether in 2022.\n\nPressing injury questions\n\nRonald Acuña Jr. had a strong case as the game’s best player before he tore his ACL last July, hitting 24 homers and stealing 17 bases in half a season. He is still not back to 100% and isn’t expected to play the outfield until May. But with the designated hitter in both leagues under the new collective bargaining agreement, Acuña may only miss a couple of weeks. Maybe he drops a round in drafts and doesn’t start running again until midseason. The latest news, however, is very encouraging.\n\nMax Muncy also gets a boost with the universal DH as he recovers from elbow surgery. Offseason reports had him behind schedule in his rehab, but he’s already playing the field in spring training games. A reliable power source and a huge asset in OBP leagues, Muncy remains undervalued.\n\nShoulder issues are a major red flag for pitchers Zac Gallen and Jack Flaherty. I had Gallen as a top 40 starter and Flaherty in the top 20 this offseason, but they’re down around 50 with Gallen likely to miss a start or two and Flaherty not expected back until mid-May.\n\nLikewise, Chris Sale (stress fracture in his rib) and Shane Baz (arthroscopic surgery on his elbow) could be out for at least another month. With a shortened spring training and lighter workloads likely early on, relying on pitchers with injury questions becomes even riskier this season.\n\nOn a much more positive note, Jacob deGrom has looked fantastic in returning to the mound for the first time since elbow problems shut him down last July. A couple of more problem-free starts this spring and he could be back atop the starting pitcher ranks on opening day.\n\nBiggest free agent boost\n\nShortstop Trevor Story was one of the last of the big-name free agents to find a home this offseason, but he may have landed in the best possible place. Even better than returning to Colorado.\n\nIn Boston, Story can take dead aim at the Green Monster and should see his offensive stats rebound no matter where he hits in that very productive lineup. Meanwhile, he’s slated to play second base – giving him valuable dual eligibility.\n\nKris Bryant and Nelson Cruz also improved their situations. Bryant, obviously, by signing in Colorado. And Cruz, by slotting behind Juan Soto in the Nationals order in one of the game’s best ballparks for right-handed power.\n\nBest trade\n\nIt was stunning to see free agent Freddie Freeman not return to Atlanta, but the Braves offense shouldn’t miss a beat with Matt Olson in his place. Olson goes from pitcher-friendly Oakland to a park that was seemingly designed with Freeman’s lefty power in mind. (Freeman, though, should do just fine as a member of the Dodgers.)\n\nOlson’s former teammate Matt Chapman should also get a boost in fantasy value going from Oakland to Toronto. Perhaps the change of scenery can help him reverse his declining barrel and contact rates.\n\nOn the down side, Jesse Winker’s move from Cincinnati to Seattle is perhaps the worst downgrade in home parks. The Mariners’ outfield depth along with Winker’s struggles versus lefties (.193/.311/.301 the past three seasons) could keep him from getting full-time at-bats.\n\nBest newcomer\n\nA four-time All-Star and two-time batting champion in Japan, Seiya Suzuki signed as a free agent with the Cubs. His greatest strength on offense is his outstanding plate discipline, which he combines with a powerful stroke that produced 38 homers in 132 games last season.\n\nThough he swings right-handed, Suzuki’s contact/power profile most closely resembles lefty hitters Kyle Tucker, Cedric Mullins, Charlie Blackmon and Juan Soto. If he can make the transition to MLB successfully – and he’s in the prime of his career at age 27 – Suzuki could be a difference-maker.\n\nScratch Pad All-Stars\n\nOur winter of labor discontent reminds us just how close we could have come to losing a huge chunk of the 2022 season. Don’t let it steal your joy. And above all else, remember our fantasy game is far from an exact science. The best players can disappoint; unknown players can become stars.\n\nWith that second thought in mind, we’ll close with our annual list of players to remember in the late stages of your draft. I keep these under-the-radar targets in mind when looking for upside beyond the overall top 200 or so.\n\n(Last year’s targets included Ty France, Jesse Winker, Mitch Haniger and Shohei Ohtani for overall impact; Myles Straw for speed; Austin Riley and Adam Duvall for power; and Freddy Peralta and Michael Kopech as impact arms.)\n\nCheap speed: Nicky Lopez, Vidal Brujan, Andres Gimenez, Jonathan Villar, Tyler Wade, Riley Greene, Tommy Pham, Lorenzo Cain, Bradley Zimmer, Victor Robles.\n\nPotential impact hitters: Jo Adell, Spencer Torkelson, Nathaniel Lowe, Oneil Cruz, Andrew Vaughn, Jesus Sanchez, Randal Grichuk, Julio Rodriguez, Clint Frazier.\n\nLate power sources: Mike Zunino, Bobby Dalbec, Rowdy Tellez, Luke Voit, Eugenio Suarez, Adam Duvall.\n\nPotential bargain pitchers: Patrick Sandoval, Steven Matz, Jon Gray, Luis Severino, Tanner Houck, Jesus Luzardo, Carlos Hernandez, Triston McKenzie, Reid Detmers.\n\nPotential closers in waiting: Devin Williams, Robert Suarez, Anthony Bender, Ken Giles, Ian Kennedy, Art Warren.\n\nFollow Gardner on Twitter @SteveAGardner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/07/13/all-star-mcclanahan-wins-10th-rays-beat-red-sox-again-4-1/50487561/", "title": "All-Star McClanahan wins 10th, Rays beat Red Sox again, 4-1", "text": "AP\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Shane McClanahan earned his 10th win and regained the major league lead in strikeouts during his final outing before the All-Star Game, pitching the Tampa Bay Rays past the Boston Red Sox 4-1 on Wednesday night.\n\nTaylor Walls homered for the Rays, who have won five straight against the rival Red Sox.\n\nMcClanahan (10-3) struck out six and allowed one run in 6 1/3 innings of three-hit ball. He increased his season total to 147 strikeouts.\n\n“That is the All-Star starter, in my opinion,” said rookie Josh Lowe, who scored from first base on a single for the Rays' final run. “No reason he doesn’t deserve to get that nod. He’s been incredible for us all year long.”\n\nTampa Bay manager Kevin Cash, who has been campaigning for his ace for weeks, was goaded into one more endorsement Wednesday night.\n\n“I hope he starts the All-Star Game, how about that? That’s the best I can give,” Cash said with a laugh. “As I’ve said, I think that’s the best first-half starting pitching performance that I’ve witnessed.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old lefty lowered his AL-best ERA to 1.71 and equaled his win total from his rookie season a year ago. He's certainly a leading candidate to start for the American League next Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.\n\n“I’m just honored to go,” McClanahan said. “It’s an honor to be included in the conversation. Whether I get the ball or not, it’s out of my control.”\n\nIt was the seventh straight start in which McClanahan lasted at least six innings and gave up no more than one earned run. He threw 85 pitches.\n\nColin Poche worked the ninth for his sixth save.\n\nJi-Man Choi drove in the game's first run with a single off Boston starter Josh Winckowski in the third.

Both players were injured Tuesday night. The Red Sox will monitor their recoveries before determining whether to put either one on the injured list. Story didn’t play and doesn’t know when he can. But he felt mostly relief after learning X-rays did not reveal a fracture to his right hand. “Anytime you can dodge a bullet when the ball hits you kind of flush in the hand like that ... I’m just kind of glad it wasn’t worse,” said Story, who was hit by a pitch from Corey Kluber on Tuesday night. There was some swelling Wednesday and Story said it was “too early to tell” if he would have to go on the IL. ...

PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Chris Sale worked five scoreless innings in his season debut, but the Boston bullpen couldn't hold a two-run lead in a 3-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday night.\n\nSale, out all season with a fracture in his right rib cage, allowed three hits with one walk and struck out five. The lefty reached 97 mph on his fastball during a 78-pitch, 53-strike outing.\n\n“I felt better as it went on,” Sale said. “Feeling strong in the fourth and fifth inning, that's nice. I'll just keep building off of that.”\n\nThe Red Sox are hoping the 33-year-old Sale can boost their chances of making the playoffs. This was just his 10th start for Boston since 2019; he missed 2020 and most of 2021 following Tommy John surgery.\n\n“Sale was tough,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “He looked really sharp for not having pitched all season long in the big leagues.”\n\nCorey Kluber (5-5) allowed two runs and four hits in six innings to beat the Red Sox in consecutive starts. The right-hander went six shutout innings in a 7-1 victory at Boston last Wednesday.\n\nThe Rays went up 3-2 in the sixth when pinch-hitter Francisco Mejía had an RBI single off Matt Strahm (3-3). Two more runs scored when the Red Sox made two errors on the same play.\n\nBrooks Raley worked the ninth for his fifth save in six chances.\n\nBoston second baseman Trevor Story left the game when he was hit on the right hand by a pitch he swung at in the fifth inning. He was scheduled to undergo X-rays late Tuesday night.\n\nTampa Bay trailed 2-1 with two out in the sixth when Taylor Walls lined a single off Strahm's left wrist. The left-hander then threw wildly to first base, allowing Isaac Paredes to score. First baseman Franchy Cordero then threw off the mark to the plate, and Mejía scored the go-ahead run.\n\nAlex Verdugo got Boston’s first hit off Kluber when he flared a single to left with one out in the fifth. He went to third when Jeter Downs — Story's replacement — had a soft single to center. Boston took a 2-0 lead on Cordero’s RBI sacrifice bunt and a run-scoring triple by Bobby Dalbec.\n\nVerdugo was picked off at third in the seventh when Boston had runners on the corners with no outs.\n\nBoston All-Star Rafael Devers, who sat out the previous three games with lower back pain, went 1 for 4 as the designated hitter. Regular DH J.D.

While it is by no means a complete archive of discontinued flavors, it includes many cereals that were released in conjunction with a popular movie or cartoon and subsequently disappeared when the hype died down.

Both salty and sweet, and sometimes both at once, these items tend to tempt consumers into eating more sugar, salt, and/or fat than is good for them.\n\nAlong the way, though, they also please us with their vivid flavors and attractive textures – and when they eventually disappear from the shelves, as many of them do, we end up missing them, even though we realize that they’re not exactly constituents of a healthy diet. (Sometimes, though, there are healthy versions of old-school junk-food snacks.)\n\nWhile some of these products might seem like innovations, most are simply variations on existing ones, imbued with new flavorings or produced in different shapes or sizes.\n\nWhy do such snack foods get discontinued? In most cases, it’s simply a matter of sales. They just don’t generate the revenue that projections called for, and so are phased out in favor of the tried-and-true, or of other new introductions that might end up doing better.\n\nProblematic logos:Does it really matter if Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben get retired?\n\nChanging images:Eskimo Pie, Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben's and Cream of Wheat are changing. Are the Washington Redskins next?\n\n24/7 Tempo consulted numerous snack food fan pages, company histories, and rating sites to compile this list of chips, candies, and other such items that we wish we could eat again right now.\n\nSometimes we get the chance. Scrapped products may be brought back in some cases, either in their original form or with slight variations (or new names). Consider, for example, the saga of the Mars candy company’s Peanut Butter Twix – which has been on and off the market numerous times since its debut in the 1980s.\n\nFans of discontinued snack foods have several options: Sometimes the products are still made in other countries, such as Mexico, Canada, or Australia, and these may be available by mail order. On the other hand, there are numerous products you can’t find outside of America.\n\nCollectors also sell unopened packages of the original on eBay and other sites – and some aficionados turn to crowd-sourcing platforms like change.org and ipetitions.com to beg companies to gear up production of their favorites again.\n\nDoritos 3D\n\n• Introduced: 1998\n\n• Discontinued: 2004\n\n• Maker: Frito-Lay\n\nBasically Doritos in a conical shape instead of the familiar flat triangle, these chips came in four flavors: Nacho Cheesier, Jalapeño & Cheddar, Texas Paprika, and Zesty Ranch.\n\n3 Musketeers Truffle Crisp Bars\n\n• Introduced: 2010\n\n• Discontinued: 2012\n\n• Maker: Mars\n\nThese finger-shaped bars were described on their packaging as \"whipped-up chocolate truffle on a crisp layer enrobed in real milk chocolate.\"\n\nAltoid Sours\n\n• Introduced: 2004\n\n• Discontinued: 2010\n\n• Maker: Wrigley\n\nThere were five flavors of these \"curiously strong\" hard candies: raspberry, lime, tangerine, apple, and mango. A single unopened tin of these Altoids is currently listed on Amazon at a price of $499.99.\n\nBlue Bell Bar-B-Q Potato Chips\n\n• Introduced: 1960\n\n• Discontinued: 1995\n\n• Maker: Sunshine Biscuits, Inc.\n\nChips from this Oregon-based brand, made by a company founded in 1929, were sold throughout the Pacific Northwest and northern California.\n\nButterfinger BBs\n\n• Introduced: 1992\n\n• Discontinued: 2006\n\n• Maker: Nestlé\n\nMore the size of marbles than BBs, these candies – once plugged on the television show \"The Simpsons\" – were reintroduced in 2009. Fans claimed they weren't the same, and in any case they're now shaped like mini-candy bars instead of spheres.\n\nCarnation Breakfast Bars\n\n• Introduced: 1975\n\n• Discontinued: 1997\n\n• Maker: Carnation\n\nThese dense protein bars came in several flavors, including Chocolate Crunch and Peanut Butter Crunch.\n\nCheetos Cheesy Checkers\n\n• Introduced: 1995\n\n• Discontinued: 1998\n\n• Maker: Frito-Lay\n\nAccording to their bag (which spelled the brand name with a hyphen, as Chee-Tos), these \"crunchy snacks\" – shaped like grates, with 12 squarish holes – were made with \"33% more cheese\" (though what this was in comparison to wasn't specified).\n\nCheetos Twisted\n\n• Introduced: 2002\n\n• Discontinued: 2012\n\n• Maker: Frito-Lay\n\nThese curlicue-shaped snacks, sometimes labeled Twisted Puffs, were described on the package as \"Dangerously Cheesy.\"\n\nCrunch Tators\n\n• Introduced: 1988\n\n• Discontinued: Early to mid 1990s\n\n• Maker: Frito-Lay\n\nSimilar in texture to what are now called \"kettle-cooked\" chips and featuring a party-animal cartoon alligator on the package, these came in two varieties – Mighty Mesquite BBQ and Hoppin' Jalapeño.\n\nDunkaroos\n\n• Introduced: 1988\n\n• Discontinued: 2012\n\n• Maker: Betty Crocker (General Mills)\n\nDunkaroos, cookies meant to be eaten dunked in the frosting they're packaged with, are still produced in Canada and Australia. Earlier this year, it was announced that they'd be returning to U.S. shelves this summer. Whether the coronavirus outbreak will delay their reintroduction remains to be seen.\n\nFiery Habanero Doritos\n\n• Introduced: 2005\n\n• Discontinued: 2012\n\n• Maker: Frito-Lay\n\nThough this flavor disappeared in the standard Doritos format, it continued on in Mexico with rolled cigarette-shaped chips under the Doritos Dinimita label, and is sold in the United States in small, three-dimensional triangles in the brand's Flavor Shots series.\n\nGolden Yangles\n\n• Introduced: 1981\n\n• Discontinued: 1992\n\n• Maker: Various regional bakers for Girl Scouts\n\nThese are a rarity in more ways than one: Not only have they been out of circulation for almost two decades, but they were a Girl Scout cookie that wasn't a cookie. Golden Yangles were puffed cheddar-flavored crackers, semi-triangular in shape, with one edge grooved into seven \"fingers.\"\n\nHershey's Bar None\n\n• Introduced: 1987\n\n• Discontinued: 1997\n\n• Maker: Hershey\n\n\"Tame the Chocolate Beasty,\" exhorted a Bar None commercial. The \"Beasty\" was a chocolate wafer with peanuts and a chocolate filling, all enclosed in more chocolate. In 1992, Hershey reformulated the Bar None to include caramel as well. A petition to bring back the candy garnered only 159 signatures.\n\nHershey's Kissables\n\n• Introduced: 2005\n\n• Discontinued: 2009\n\n• Maker: Hershey\n\nKissables, miniature Hershey's Kisses coated in a hard candy shell, were originally made with milk chocolate, but the formula changed in 2007 and they lost the \"milk chocolate\" designation. Two years later, Hershey pulled the plug.\n\nJell-O Pudding Pops\n\n• Introduced: 1982\n\n• Discontinued: 1993\n\n• Maker: General Foods\n\nFrozen pudding on a stick, these Pops came in various flavors, including chocolate, vanilla, and banana. They were first test-marketed in 1978, but rolled out nationwide only four years later. The Jell-O name was licensed to Popsicle in 2004, and the latter company marketed Popsicle-shaped Jell-O Pops until about 2011, when they faded away again.\n\nJoey Chips\n\n• Introduced: 1967\n\n• Discontinued: 1992 (?)\n\n• Maker: General Mills\n\nBilled as \"The Corny Potato Chip,\" these extruded, ridged chips were part reconstituted potato, part reconstituted corn.\n\nJuliettes\n\n• Introduced: 1984/1993\n\n• Discontinued: 1985/1996\n\n• Maker: Little Brownie Bakers for Girl Scouts\n\nCookie-shaped versions of the chocolate turtle – cookies enhanced with pecans and caramel and covered with chocolate – these were named after Juliette Low, founder of the Girl Scouts. They made two appearances, in the mid-1980s and again in the mid-1990s.\n\nJumpin' Jack Cheese Doritos\n\n• Introduced: 1990\n\n• Discontinued: 1995\n\n• Maker: Frito-Lay\n\nJay Leno did commercials for these chips before his \"Tonight Show\" days. They were re-released for a limited time as a \"throwback\" flavor in 2013, then vanished again.\n\nLife Saver Holes\n\n• Introduced: 1990\n\n• Discontinued: Early 1990s\n\n• Maker: Nabisco\n\nNabisco began test-marketing these candies in 1989, before rolling them out nationally the following year. Though supposedly the centers removed from Life Savers, they were basically just Life Savers without the holes. They were recalled in 1991 because the cap on the tube they were packaged in proved to be a choking hazard for very young children. Though they went back on sale a few months later, they soon disappeared for good.\n\nMagic Middles\n\n• Introduced: 2001\n\n• Discontinued: 2011\n\n• Maker: Keebler (Kellogg)\n\nThese were shortbread cookies filled with either fudge or peanut butter. It is said that the company phased them out because it needed the equipment that produced them for another item.\n\nMarathon Bar\n\n• Introduced: 1973\n\n• Discontinued: 1981\n\n• Maker: Mars\n\nThis candy bar, consisting of braided caramel covered in chocolate, was 8 inches long and had a ruler on the back of the package to prove it. (A 15-inch version, also with a ruler, was sold in some places.) Because of its size, it was advertised as \"the candy bar you can't eat quickly.\" Though the Marathon is defunct, Cadbury's Curly Wurly, made in the United Kingdom, is said to be virtually identical.\n\nMunch 'Ems\n\n• Introduced: 1991\n\n• Discontinued: Early 2000s\n\n• Maker: Keebler\n\nBilled as \"Crackers That Crunch Like Chips!,\" Munch 'Ems were snack crackers produced in various flavors, including cheddar, ranch, and sour cream & onion.\n\nOreo Big Stuf\n\n• Introduced: 1984\n\n• Discontinued: 1991\n\n• Maker: Nabisco\n\nA gigantic Oreo, sold individually wrapped in boxes of 10, the Big Stuf weighed in at 316 calories, and was said to take 20 minutes to eat.\n\nOreo Cakesters\n\n• Introduced: 2007\n\n• Discontinued: 2012\n\n• Maker: Nabisco\n\nIn a classic example of messing with success, Nabisco had the idea of replacing the cookie part of Oreos with soft chocolate sponge cake-like discs.\n\nPB Max\n\n• Introduced: 1990\n\n• Discontinued: 1994\n\n• Maker: Mars\n\nThis candy bar was a chocolate-coated arrangement of peanut butter and oats on top of a whole-grain cookie. Though it proved popular, it is said to have been discontinued simply because members of the Mars family didn't like peanut butter.\n\nPizzarias Pizza Chips\n\n• Introduced: 1991\n\n• Discontinued: 2000 (?)\n\n• Maker: Keebler\n\nThe launch of these Doritos-shaped chips – in Cheese Pizza, Pizza Supreme, and Zesty Pepperoni flavors – was described by Keebler as \"the most successful savory snack debut in the company's history,\" generating wholesale revenue of $75 million in their first year. They were discontinued around the time that Kellogg's bought Keebler. A BringBackPizzarias Facebook group currently has more than 4,842 followers.\n\nPlanters P.B. Crisps\n\n• Introduced: 1992\n\n• Discontinued: 1995 (?)\n\n• Maker: Nabisco\n\nThese were cookies in the shape of oversized peanuts. There were three flavors – P.B. (peanut butter), Chocolate, and PB&J. A social media campaign is still trying to convince Planters to bring them back.\n\nReese's Bites\n\n• Introduced: 1999\n\n• Discontinued: 2004\n\n• Maker: Hershey\n\nSmall chocolate-coated spheres of peanut butter – in effect peanut butter cups in a different form – might have sounded like a good idea, but they turned out to be a choking hazard, so were taken off the market.\n\nReese's Peanut Butter & Banana Creme Cups\n\n• Introduced: 2007\n\n• Discontinued: 2008\n\n• Maker: Hershey\n\nThese were conceived as a tribute to Elvis, based on what was reputed to be his favorite sandwich (peanut butter and bananas), and the packaging bore an image of him – in younger years – with the legend \"Live Like the King.\"\n\nReggie! bars\n\n• Introduced: 1978\n\n• Discontinued: 1982\n\n• Maker: Wayne Candies\n\nSimilar to turtle candies in appearance and, like turtles, made of chocolate-coated caramel and peanuts, these were originally marketed as Bun Bars. In an effort to boost sales, their maker renamed them in honor of famed New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson. In 1982, a year after Jackson left the Yankees, the candy disappeared. It made a brief comeback in 1993 when Jackson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nScreaming Yellow Zonkers\n\n• Introduced: 1968\n\n• Discontinued: 2007\n\n• Maker: Lincoln Foods\n\nBasically a sweetened popcorn, like Cracker Jack but without the nuts, SYZ – as their fans called the snack – was known for its vivid boxes, featuring designs by noted illustrators and humorous copy. ConAgra, which bought the original manufacturer in 2007 and discontinued SYZ, brought Zonkers back in 2012 as an exclusive for Walgreens, but they've since disappeared again.\n\nSummit Cookie Bars\n\n• Introduced: 1977\n\n• Discontinued: 1991\n\n• Maker: Mars\n\nSomewhere between candy and a cookie, the Summit was similar to the Kit Kat bar, but with the addition of roasted peanuts.\n\nSwoops\n\n• Introduced: 2003\n\n• Discontinued: 2006\n\n• Maker: Hershey\n\nThese were basically Pringle-shaped crisp versions of several of Hershey's iconic candy offerings, including Almond Joy, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and the Hershey Milk Chocolate bar itself.\n\nTato Skins\n\n• Introduced: 1985\n\n• Discontinued: 2000 (?)\n\n• Maker: Keebler\n\nPotato skins turned into chips, in such flavors as Cheddar Cheese n' Bacon and Sour Cream n' Chives, these didn't exactly disappear around the year 2000. It was then that Keebler sold its Tato Skins division to an Arizona-based snack food company, Poore Brothers (later renamed Inventure Foods) – which promptly made a deal with the TGI Friday restaurant chain to market the chips under their label. Fans of the original, though, maintain that the formula has changed and that the Friday's version isn't the same.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pies\n\n• Introduced: 1991\n\n• Discontinued: 1991\n\n• Maker: Hostess\n\nThere were numerous food tie-ins to this once-popular cartoon franchise. This example seems to be the one that people miss the most.

The average price has gone down at least 1 cent daily for 38 straight days.\n\nGross said three things have factored into falling prices: the cost of oil, less demand for gas and \"a pretty good little Band-Aid\" in the Biden administration releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nThe biggest factor for the cost of gas is oil prices, Gross said. U.S. crude oil hit $93.18 a barrel, while the international standard Brent crude cost $103.81 as of Wednesday, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, both of which have dropped at least 20 cents a barrel since the July Fourth weekend.\n\nOn the demand side, data from the EIA and AAA shows the gas demand is similar to July 2020, when strict COVID-19 restrictions were in place.\n\nFREE LAND?Copy-paste error results in Nevada homebuyer getting 87 properties for the price of one home\n\nWill gas prices continue to drop?\n\nThere is no clear answer since there are numerous factors that can affect the cost of gas, such as price of oil, demand, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation and fears of a recession.\n\nGross said what could really \"overturn the applecart\" is the hurricane season.\n\n\"Hurricanes inevitably go right through the place where there's oil production and refining.

Jackie Walorski will be held Thursday in her home state, where she and three other people were killed in a head-on highway crash on Aug. 3. The funeral is scheduled to start at 11 a.m. ET at Granger Community Church in Mishawaka, Indiana. She will be buried at a cemetery in South Bend Thursday afternoon. The vehicle Walorski was riding in caused the crash that killed her, two staffers and the driver of another vehicle, according to an Indiana sheriff's office. Walorski was first elected to represent northern Indiana's 2nd Congressional District in 2012 and was seeking reelection this year in the solidly Republican district. Walorski's husband, Dean Swihart, said in a statement Wednesday that he was \"touched by the support and kindness\" the family has received since her death. \"Her loss leaves a massive void in our family, our community and in Congress,\" Swihart said.\n\nGeorgia gubernatorial race heats up as Gov. Kemp is set to unfurl policy proposals\n\nGeorgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will unfurl his first major policy proposals of his reelection bid Thursday, pledging another state income tax rebate and revival of a long-dormant state property tax break while contending with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. After Abrams argued that \"miserly\" Republicans are denying basic services and ignoring inequities in pursuit of low spending and tax cuts for the rich, Kemp took on Abrams as he celebrated record-high economic development numbers Wednesday. Abrams is seeking traction she narrowly trails Kemp in the polls in a crucial swing state. The challenger argues that not only Kemp's fiscal policies but his support for abortion restrictions, loose gun laws and tighter controls on what's taught in schools threaten the growth of a $683 billion state economy. Former President Donald Trump angrily targeted the incumbent Kemp during primary season. But Kemp shellacked the Trump-backed David Perdue and won with more than 70% of the vote earlier this year.\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower peaks tonight\n\nWhat NASA calls \"the best meteor shower of the year\" – the Perseids – will peak Thursday night, according to the American Meteor Society. But stargazers could be disappointed: The moon will be full, which can spoil the show because of its brilliant light. The Perseid meteor shower occurs every year when the Earth passes through the cloud of debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle. The meteors are actually tiny dust and particles from the tail of the comet as it orbits the sun. The next full moon will rise in the evening sky Thursday, and it will be both a \"sturgeon moon\" and a \"supermoon.\" The moon reaches peak illumination at 9:36 p.m. No special equipment is needed to enjoy the spectacle, just a dark sky and some patience, both of which could be in short supply this year because of the full moon.\n\nMajor League Baseball is coming back to the Field of Dreams\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds will face the Chicago Cubs Thursday night (7:15 p.m. ET, FOX) in a throwback ballpark in the cornfields of Dyersville, Iowa, a short walk from the field where Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta and Amy Madigan filmed the famous 1989 baseball movie, \"Field of Dreams.\" The game comes about 2 1/2 months after Liotta, who played the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson, died at the age of 67. Each team will wear special uniforms inspired by how the franchises looked in the early 20th century, and Cincinnati first baseman Joey Votto and Chicago outfielder Ian Happ will be on two-way mics for the broadcast. It's the second go-round for Major League Baseball at the site in Dyersville — population of about 4,400 — after the Chicago White Sox defeated the New York Yankees in a thrilling first MLB game in Iowa.

Speedy Gas at 1607 Philadelphia Pike in Claymont is also listed at $1.99.\n\nMotorists are filling up for even cheaper – $1.97 a gallon – at the Riggins station at the Meadowood Service Center at 2650 Kirkwood Highway.\n\nThe last time gas was below $2 a gallon in Delaware was April 24, 2009, said Jim Lardear, director of public and government affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic.\n\nMany fuel retailers in the First State are hovering around the $2 mark. Stations in New Castle, Claymont and Bridgeville are averaging the lowest prices statewide, according to AAA surveys.\n\nStatewide, gas prices on Friday were down 11 cents over last week and 44 cents over the last month, averaging $2.20 a gallon, compared with $3.39 a year ago, Lardear said. Diesel is averaging $2.76 a gallon in Delaware.\n\nNationally, gas averaged $2.08 Friday. In the region, New Jersey averaged $2.03, Maryland at $2.22, and Pennsylvania at $2.35 a gallon, according to AAA.\n\nAAA expects the national average price for regular unleaded to remain below $3 a gallon through 2015, as long as the price of crude oil doesn't spike, Lardear said.\n\n\"Gas prices may see seasonal increases this spring as refineries undergo maintenance, or this summer as demand increases,\" he said. \"But those higher prices should be much less than in recent years.\"\n\nFalling gas prices are in part the result of increased U.S. oil production and the decision by OPEC partners to keep their production high.\n\nIn late December, Missouri became the first state in five years to have its statewide average drop below $2 per gallon.\n\nCris Barrish and USA TODAY contributed to this story.\n\nContact Melissa Nann Burke at (302) 324-2329, mburke@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @nannburke.\n\nFIND FUEL PRICES\n\nVisit AAA's website to search by town or ZIP code for gas prices: midatlantic.aaa.com/PGA/FuelPriceFinder", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/06/22/biden-gas-tax-holiday-brief-impact/7692092001/", "title": "Gas tax holiday relief will be brief. We should expect higher prices.", "text": "President Biden proposes a three-month federal gas-tax holiday.\n\nThe 18.4-cent tax on gas and 24.4-cent tax on diesel would be suspended for producers.\n\nBut experts say consumers will likely only feel little, if any, relief and maybe, even boost prices.\n\nIt’s unlikely Americans will feel any significant or lasting relief from President Joe Biden's proposal Wednesday for a three-month federal gas tax holiday.\n\nThe average national gas price fell this week for the first time in nine weeks, slipping below the key $5 per gallon for regular unleaded, according to GasBuddy. The decline was in line with a tumble in oil prices to about $110 per barrel, from $122, on fears the global economy is slowing and may fall into recession, AAA said.\n\nBut an easing in gas prices last week doesn’t mean the coast is clear. The world still has lower-than-usual stockpiles of oil and gas and stretched refining capacity to transform oil into consumer products, and consumption remains strong. AAA predicts car travel will set a record with 42 million people hitting the road this July 4 weekend despite historically high gas prices.\n\nPointing fingers:With gas prices at $5 a gallon, Biden tells oil companies to cut costs for Americans\n\nCOLA versus inflation:Will cost-of-living raises push inflation even higher? Maybe, but the effect is small\n\nStrong demand could make it backfire\n\nThe gas tax holiday, which would suspend the 18.4-cent federal tax on each gallon of gas and 24.4 cents on each gallon of diesel fuel for gas producers (not consumers), would require congressional approval. Biden would need 60 votes – at least 10 from Republicans – in the evenly divided Senate to overcome any filibuster.\n\nIf passed, experts see such a move as only providing mild temporary relief, if any, for consumers. The Penn Wharton Budget Model from the University of Pennsylvania estimated that a 10-month federal gas tax holiday would lower average per-capita gas spending by $16 to $47, depending on demand.\n\nKey words: depending on demand.\n\n“While a gas tax holiday may provide temporary relief from record-setting prices for some consumers, it may also drive demand even higher, thereby stoking inflation,” said John Leer, chief economist at research firm Morning Consult.\n\nBiden also is encouraging states to suspend their gas taxes, but that’s also unlikely to provide relief for consumers for more than a day or so.\n\nOn average, one-third of an increase – or decrease – in state gasoline tax rates is passed through to consumers in the retail price on the day the change takes effect, with no significant impact after that time, according to a June 2020 study by the ARTBA Transportation Investment Advocacy Center.\n\nWhat the world needs now is more supply\n\nWith summer driving not looking to let up any time soon, any lasting relief for consumers at the pump will require rebuilding dwindling supplies. U.S. gasoline inventories ended March 2.6% below the previous five-year average, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\n“To calm inflation, the U.S. needs additional supply relative to demand, and a gas tax holiday won't do that,” Leer said.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no quick fix for supply issues, experts say.\n\nLess government revenue:Biden is calling for a 'gas tax holiday.' What do gas taxes pay for?\n\nSurging prices:Another record month for inflation: New level driven by gas, grocery prices and high rent\n\n“Unless the U.S. government is able to find a refinery it can help restart or ramp up production in the next few months, the Biden administration will be left with few good options,” Natasha Kaneva, JPMorgan’s head of global commodities research, wrote in a report.\n\nBiden plans to visit Saudi Arabia next month, though, and some expect him to try to persuade the Saudis to pump more oil, which historically lowers crude prices.\n\nWhere does that leave consumers?\n\nIn the end, consumers will likely just have to continue to stomach higher pump prices and let the laws of supply and demand take over. Cutting taxes on gasoline and diesel, offering untargeted energy subsidies, or introducing price gouging legislation only fuels demand and puts more pressure on “supply chains that are already creaking,” Kaneva said.\n\nIn the U.S., eight states accounting for close to 9% of global gasoline demand have already either introduced tax breaks on gasoline or are considering suspending state taxes on gas, but gas prices are still near record highs, she noted.\n\n“With demand stimulated and supply constrained, fuel prices will continue rising until demand is destroyed to a level where it can meet supply,” she said.\n\nThere are two ways demand destruction can occur: directly through rationing and indirectly through high prices. Kaneva doesn’t believe politicians will ration fuel, so the only avenue left is to allow fuel prices to keep rising to automatically depress demand. She doesn’t see balance returning to the gas market until the national average costs at least $6 per gallon.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Following the National Archives' recovering of White House records from Mar-a-Lago in recent months, the FBI on Monday had to verify that nothing was left behind.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former FBI official shares what struck him about FBI search Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former FBI official shares what struck him about FBI search 02:03\n\nTrump's son, Eric, told Fox host Sean Hannity that \"the purpose of the raid, from what they said, was because the National Archives wanted to, you know, corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession.\"\n\nChristina Bobb, Trump's attorney, said the FBI seized documents. \"President Trump and his legal team have been cooperative with FBI and DOJ officials every step of the way. The FBI did conduct an unannounced raid and seized paper,\" Bobb said\n\nThere was communication between the FBI and US Secret Service before the search warrant was executed Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, allowing for the FBI to access the estate without any complications. There is only a small Secret Service footprint at Mar-a-Lago when Trump is not there.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.\n\nA White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.\n\nInvestigation into documents\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort -- including some that were classified\n\nIn early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump's time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump's attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.\n\nA second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.\n\nFive days later, on June 8, Trump's attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.\n\nIn April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n\"It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,\" said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst.\n\nHonig told CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront\" that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.\n\n\"Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they're interpreting that as a 90 day rule,\" he said.\n\nMembers of GOP back Trump\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats \"continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,\" and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President's defense on social media.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had \"seen enough.\"\n\n\"Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. I've seen enough. The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,\" the Republican leader wrote. \"When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that \"we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.\"\n\nBut the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump's handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to \"fully investigate\" the former President's handling of information.\n\n\"Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America's national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,\" Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said.\n\n\"Although details of today's actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump's potentially grave mishandling of classified information.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Katelyn Polantz", "Sara Murray", "Evan Perez", "Gaborr", "Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/garland-announcement-justice-department/index.html", "title": "Merrick Garland: DOJ filed motion to unseal Mar-a-Lago warrant and ...", "text": "(CNN) In his first public statement since federal agents searched former President Donald Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week, Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday said that the Justice Department had filed in court a request that the search warrant and property receipt from the search be unsealed.\n\nGarland also said he \"personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant in this matter.\"\n\nHe noted that the department did not comment on the search on the day that it occurred. He pointed out that the search was confirmed by Trump that evening. He said that copies of the warrant and the warrant receipt were provided to the Trump lawyers who were on site during the search.\n\n\"The Department filed the motion to make public the warrant and receipt in light of the former president's public confirmation of the search, the surrounding circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter,\" Garland said. \"Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy. Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly without fear or favor. Under my watch, that is precisely what the Justice Department is doing.\"\n\nThe statement comes after days of silence from the Justice Department with regard to the search, as is the department's normal practice for ongoing investigations. Garland stressed that some of the department's work must happen outside of public view.\n\n\"We do that to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to protect the integrity of our investigations,\" he said, while explaining that he would not provide more detail about the basis of the search.\n\nTrump said in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform Thursday that he would \"not oppose the release of documents,\" adding, \"I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.\"\n\nThe court had instructed the Justice Department to confer with Trump about its request to unseal certain warrant documents from the FBI Mar-a-Lago search and to tell the court by Friday 3 p.m. ET if he opposes their release. CNN reported earlier Thursday that Trump and his legal team had not yet reached a decision on how to respond to the Justice Department's motion, according to a source familiar with their thinking.\n\nTrump's team had contacted outside attorneys about how to proceed, and the former President's orbit was caught off guard by Garland's announcement.\n\nIn a pair of posts to Truth Social following Garland's statement, Trump continued to claim that his attorneys were \"cooperating fully\" and had developed \"very good relationships\" with federal investigators prior to Monday's search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The government could have had whatever they wanted, if we had it,\" Trump said. \"Everything was fine, better than most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even 'safecrackers.'\"\n\nJustice Department asks court for documents to be released\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant Monday at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing people familiar with the investigation, reported Thursday night that classified documents related to nuclear weapons were among the items that FBI agents sought when executing the Mar-a-Lago search warrant.\n\nThe people did not offer additional details to the Post about \"what type of information the agents were seeking\" or whether any such documents were recovered, the paper reported.\n\nNewly filed court documents outline what the Justice Department officially moved to do Thursday.\n\n\"On August 8, 2022, the Department of Justice executed a search warrant, issued by this Court upon the requisite finding of probable cause... at the premises located at 1100 S. Ocean Blvd., Palm Beach, Florida 33480, a property of former President Donald J. Trump,\" the motion reads.\n\n\"At the time the warrant was initially executed, the Department provided notice directly to former President Trump's counsel. The Department did not make any public statements about the search, and the search apparently attracted little or no public attention as it was taking place. Later that same day, former President Trump issued a public statement acknowledging the execution of the warrant. In the days since, the search warrant and related materials have been the subject of significant interest and attention from news media organizations and other entities,\" the Justice Department writes.\n\nDOJ then argues for unsealing the search warrant, citing \"the intense public interest presented by a search of a residence of a former President.\"\n\nThe filing confirms that the search warrant was \"signed and approved by the Court on August 5.\" On Thursday, the DOJ filed \"the redacted Property Receipt listing items seized pursuant to the search,\" according to its unsealing motion.\n\n﻿\"Former President Trump, through counsel, was provided copies of each of these documents on August 8, 2022, as part of the execution of the search,\" the filing adds.\n\nEarlier this year, officials from the National Archives arranged the retrieval of 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago. In June, federal investigators served a grand jury subpoena and took away sensitive national security documents.\n\nThen, according to sources, prosecutors developed evidence that there were potentially classified documents with national security implications remaining at the property.\n\nFBI officials under attack\n\nRepublican lawmakers have lashed out at the department, calling the search politically motivated. Several lawmakers on the right have called for increased oversight of the department, and some have even suggested defunding the FBI or that agents planted evidence at the Florida estate.\n\nViolent threats also have exploded online since the search. Posters have written things like \"Garland needs to be assassinated\" and \"kill all feds.\" The biography and contact information of a federal magistrate judge who appears to have signed the search warrant used to execute the search at Mar-a-Lago has been wiped from a Florida court's website after he too became the target of violent threats.\n\nIn a message reviewed by CNN on Thursday moments ahead of the public statement, FBI Director Chris Wray told the bureau's employees their \"safety and security\" was his \"primary concern right now.\"\n\n\"There has been a lot of commentary about the FBI this week questioning our work and motives,\" Wray said. \"Much of it is from critics and pundits on the outside who don't know what we know and don't see what we see. What I know — and what I see — is an organization made up of men and women who are committed to doing their jobs professionally and by the book every day; this week is no exception.\"\n\nIn his public comments, Garland also called out the \"unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department agents and prosecutors.\"\n\n\"I will not stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked. The men and women of the FBI and the Justice Department are dedicated patriotic public servants,\" he said. \"Every day, they protect the American people from violent crime, terrorism and other threats to their safety while safeguarding our civil rights. They do so at great personal sacrifice and risk to themselves.

Top Republicans made clear that they want to get answers and a full accounting from the Justice Department.\n\nThe call had been previously scheduled in order to discuss the Inflation Reduction Act that's coming to the House floor Friday.\n\nBut at the top of the call, McCarthy kicked things off then turned things over to Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThey repeated their demands for accountability, but did not signal what their specific oversight plans will be if they win the majority.\n\nTrump is also set to meet Tuesday with about a dozen members of the House Republican Study Committee, led by Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, at his residence in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to a person familiar with their plans, providing a timely opportunity for the former president to rally members to his side after the FBI search.\n\nA July CNN poll found that a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters do not want Trump to be their party's nominee in the 2024 presidential election. But the former president still is powerful within the party; Republican candidates across the country have sought his endorsement in their 2022 primaries, and on Saturday, Trump overwhelmingly won an unofficial straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas.\n\nRallying around Trump, many Republicans, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, attacked Democrats instead after news of the FBI search, with some saying that Biden himself must be investigated.\n\n\"There must be an immediate investigation and accountability into Joe Biden and his Administration's weaponizing this department against their political opponents -- the likely 2024 Republican candidate for President of the United States,\" said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, a member of House GOP leadership.\n\nTurner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, requested an \"immediate briefing\" from FBI Director Christopher Wray, saying the agency's action was \"unprecedented\" and that he was \"unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat\" posed by materials in Trump's possession.\n\nMissouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, a potential 2024 contender, criticized Biden, saying that he \"has taken our republic into dangerous waters\" and called for Garland to either resign or be impeached.\n\n\"At a minimum, Garland must resign or be impeached. The search warrant must be published. Christoper Wray must be removed. And the FBI reformed top to bottom,\" Hawley tweeted.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence called on Garland to provide a \"full accounting\" of the FBI search.\n\n\"I share the deep concern of millions of Americans over the unprecedented search of the personal residence of President Trump,\" Pence tweeted.\n\n\"Yesterday's action undermines public confidence in our system of justice and Attorney General Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken, and he must do so immediately,\" he said.\n\nWhile many prominent Republicans were quick to criticize the Biden administration and defend Trump, others took a more muted approach as questions remained around the cause of the FBI's search.\n\nAt a news conference in Kentucky focused on flood damage, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on the FBI executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. \"I'm here today to talk about the flood and the recovery from the flood,\" he said.\n\nHours later, the Republican leader released a statement calling for Garland to \"immediately\" explain what happened.\n\n\"The country deserves a thorough and immediate explanation of what led to the events of Monday,\" McConnell said. \"Attorney General Garland and the Department of Justice should already have provided answers to the American people and must do so immediately.\"\n\nDemocrats responded that no one is above the law.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on NBC's Today show that she first learned of the FBI's search when it \"flashed\" on her phone, and repeatedly said she only knows what is public.\n\n\"We believe in the rule of the law,\" Pelosi added.\n\nAnd Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House Oversight Committee investigating Trump's handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to \"fully investigate\" the former president's handling of information.\n\n\"Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America's national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,\" said the New York Democrat. \"Although details of today's actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump's potentially grave mishandling of classified information.\"\n\nA number of Senate Republicans cried foul about the Justice Department taking action against Trump, a former and presumed future rival of President Joe Biden.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said, \"President Trump is likely going to run again in 2024,\" and noted the midterm elections are in less than 100 days away. \"Launching such an investigation of a former President this close to an election is beyond problematic.\"\n\nThe FBI search also quickly became a talking point in the Florida gubernatorial race. Governor Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 Republican rival to Trump, tweeted, \"The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime's political opponents,\" referring to the Biden administration.\n\nFlorida Rep.

The latest action prompted Trump to make accusations of a \"witch hunt\" in all levels of government, including the bureau itself. However, FBI Director Christopher Wray was appointed by Trump while he was president.\n\nWray defends FBI against new threats\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray defended the bureau Thursday against a new wave of threats in the aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search and an attempted breach of bureau offices in Cincinnati by an armed man.\n\n“Unfounded attacks on the integrity of the FBI erode respect for the rule of law and are a grave disservice to the men and women who sacrifice so much to protect others,” Wray said in a statement.\n\n“Violence and threats against law enforcement, including the FBI, are dangerous and should be deeply concerning to all Americans.

The subpoena was related to a visit federal authorities made to the Mar-a-Lago property in June when the Secret Service again facilitated their entry to the estate, said the person who is not authorized to comment publicly.

These are sickening comments that put the lives of patriotic public servants at risk,\" Cheney tweeted on Thursday, shortly after Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke at the Justice Department about the search.\n\nSince that law enforcement action, several right-wing Republicans have called for the defunding of the FBI, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who tweeted \"DEFUND THE FBI\" on Monday night.\n\nCheney has been a fierce critic of Trump and some of his allies, and, with her vice chairmanship of the House's Jan. 6 committee, has sought to spotlight his actions related to the Capitol attack.\n\n– Katie Wadington\n\nGOP reacts to Merrick Garland statement on Mar-a-Lago search\n\nRepublican lawmakers responded to Attorney General Merrick Garland’s statement on the Monday search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence with more questions and criticism.\n\nSen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., urged the Justice Department to release additional information, like the basis of the search and why it was necessary “within 90 days of the midterm election,” suggesting that “half the country believes that when it comes to President Trump there are no rules.”\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., described the probe as a “politically motivated witch hunt,” and a number of House Republicans criticized Garland and his purported lack of transparency directly.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee on its official Twitter account asked whether the Justice Department would apply the “same standards” to President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden and gave an answer to its own question: “Nope.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nOpinion:Democrats so badly want Trump to go away, but FBI's Mar-a-Lago search is helping him stay\n\n'Defund the FBI':Trump supporters react to Mar-a-Lago search\n\nWhy are search warrants, like the one involving Trump's Mar-a-Lago, sealed?\n\nThe search warrant, as is often the case, was sealed for a reason, and unsealing it to appease political supporters of Trump – or his detractors – would go against long-standing Justice Department policy and tradition.\n\nThe reason search warrants are sealed, along with the accompanying sworn affidavit by an investigating federal law enforcement agent, is that they provide confidential details of a criminal probe that is operating in secret so as not to tip the government’s hand to those under investigation, according to David Kelley, the former interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nOpinion:GOP says no to helping Americans, coddles Trump. Now the FBI has searched his home.\n\nGarland defends federal law enforcement\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday also addressed what he called “unfounded attacks on the professionalism” of federal law enforcement officials since the search.\n\nRepublicans have denounced the search as politically motivated, and the FBI has responded to threats against the agency since the search.\n\n“I will not stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked. The men and women of the FBI and the Justice Department are dedicated, patriotic public servants,” Garland said. “Every day, they protect the American people from violent crime, terrorism and other threats to their safety while safeguarding our civil rights. They do so at great personal sacrifice and risk to themselves. I am honored to work alongside them.”\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nTrump doesn't comment on Garland, criticizes Obama instead\n\nMinutes after Attorney General Merrick Garland's remarks, former President Donald Trump posted a comment on Truth Social that did not address the attorney but instead criticized predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nTrump said he wants to know what happened to the records Obama and his aides took with them when they left the White House in 2017, saying \"the Fake News Media refuses to talk about that. They want it CANCELED!\"\n\nThe cases are nothing alike.\n\nObama officials transferred their records through the National Archives to their home base in Chicago, where they planned to digitize them for inclusion in their presidential library.\n\nTrump allegedly took boxes of items to his home in Mar-a-Lago, prompting complaints from the National Archives that led to the current investigation and this week's search of the president's home.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nJustice Department asks judge to unseal warrant, if Trump approves\n\nThe Justice Department’s motion asking a federal judge to unseal the warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home opens the door for Trump to stop it from becoming public.\n\nThe department argues the court should unseal the search warrant, attachments and property receipt “absent objection from the former president.”\n\n“The public’s clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred under these circumstances weighs heavily in favor of unsealing,” Justice Department attorneys wrote in their motion. “That said, the former President should have an opportunity to respond to this Motion and lodge objections, including with regards to any ‘legitimate privacy interests’ or the potential for other ‘injury’ if these materials are made public.”\n\nRepublicans have been beating a drum to release the warrant and associated documents since the FBI conducted its search on Monday.\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nRead the Justice Department's motion to unseal the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago\n\nTrump’s confirmation prompted Justice to unseal warrant\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said a combination of factors influenced the Justice Department’s decision to file to unseal the search warrant.\n\nThose included: Trump’s confirmation of the search, made via a public statement Monday, “surrounding circumstances” and the “substantial public interest in the matter.”\n\n– Rick Rouan\n\nAG signed off on seeking search warrant\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said he personally approved the department’s decision to seek a search warrant of former President Donald Trump’s residence in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nGarland said this was in accordance with Department of Justice policy and procedures, and added, “The department does not take such a decision lightly.”\n\n“Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly, without favor,” Garland said. “Under my watch, that is precisely what the Justice Department is doing.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nDOJ seeks to unseal search warrant of Mar-a-Lago\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department Justice has asked a federal court in South Florida to unseal a search warrant and property receipt related to a search of the former president’s home.\n\nGarland said a federal court authorized the search “upon the required finding of probable cause.” He said the DOJ’s motion came “in light of the former president’s public confirmation” as well as “the substantial public interest in this matter.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhite House: Biden did not have prior knowledge of Garland’s statement\n\nA White House official said President Joe Biden had no prior knowledge that Garland would be making a statement Thursday and learned about it through media reports.\n\nThe White House has previously said Biden was not given advance notice of the FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property Monday.\n\n“We did not have advance notice of this activity,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this week.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWho is Merrick Garland?\n\nBefore he was attorney general, Garland was a longtime judge who was nominated for the Justice Department post when Joe Biden won the presidency.\n\nGarland is a Chicago native who attended Harvard University for both undergraduate studies and law school. He practiced corporate law and then served as a deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, who then nominated him to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nPresident Barack Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court in 2016, but he was never confirmed to the high court when Senate Republicans declined to give him a hearing.\n\nPREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS:Trump in midst of gathering storm of investigations.

The search warrant pertained to both the handling of classified documents and the Presidential Records Act.\n\nThere was also suspicion, after months of discussion on the matter, that Trump representatives were not being completely truthful with investigators, the source said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on some of the details of the search.\n\nAs part of the FBI investigation, Justice Department investigators previously subpoenaed the Trump Organization for a copy of Mar-a-Lago's surveillance tapes, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. The organization complied with the subpoena, which was first reported by The New York Times, and handed over the Mar-a-Lago surveillance tapes to investigators, the source said.\n\nBefore FBI agents arrived Monday at Trump's private club and searched his residence, people around the former President had been under the impression that the probe into how he handled classified information had stalled, according to two sources familiar with the thinking.\n\nFor months, investigators had been looking into how Trump handled material taken with him when he left the White House after the National Archives referred the case to the Justice Department earlier this year. It remains unclear why those around the former President believed the investigation had stalled, but in June, his attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to preserve the remaining documents in his possession \"until further notice,\" one source told CNN.\n\nThe concern arose after the former President had returned some 15 boxes of materials to the National Archives.\n\nA source familiar with Trump team deliberations said it will push an argument that Trump didn't have any classified information at Mar-a-Lago because he declassified it when he was President.\n\nLegal analysts say the declassification procedure is a bit of a gray area when it comes to the president and producing proof. One former White House lawyer said the White House counsel would typically want to create a memo detailing the declassification for the president to sign, but that is not a requirement.\n\n\"The president has wide latitude to declassify, and there's no strict, formal procedure that must be followed,\" CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said. \"So if Trump claims he declassified documents while in office, that could come down to a factual dispute and would turn on the strength of the evidence either way.\"\n\nAfter leaving office, a former president no longer has the authority to declassify information.\n\nThis, of course, does not address the Presidential Records Act and the requirement that White House documents be preserved with the National Archives.\n\nOn Monday, federal agents removed boxes of material from the Palm Beach property.\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago search, which focused on the area of the club where Trump's offices and personal quarters are located, marked a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. It was the first time in American history that a former president's home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Secret Service had about an hour heads up before the FBI executed the warrant, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.

Earlier this year, officials from the National Archives and Records Administration, known as NARA, recovered 15 boxes of presidential documents from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump's lawyers previously worked with NARA to voluntarily turn over some documents, but the Mar-a-Lago search clearly indicates a new phase of the probe. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is a politically motivated sham, intended to derail his potential bid to return to the White House.\n\nHere's a timeline of the key moments from the blockbuster investigation.\n\nMay 2021\n\nAn official from NARA contacts Trump's team after realizing that several important documents weren't handed over before Trump left the White House. In hopes of locating the missing items, NARA lawyer Gary Stern reaches out to someone who served in the White House counsel's office under Trump, who was the point of contact for recordkeeping matters. The missing documents include some of Trump's correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as the map of Hurricane Dorian that Trump infamously altered with a sharpie pen.\n\nFall 2021\n\nNARA grows frustrated with the slow pace of document turnover after several months of conversations with the Trump team. Stern reaches out to another Trump attorney to intervene. The archivist asks about several boxes of records that were apparently taken to Mar-a-Lago during Trump's relocation to Florida. NARA still doesn't receive the White House documents they are searching for.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAfter months of discussions with Trump's team, NARA retrieves 15 boxes of Trump White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA says in a statement that some of the records it received at the end of Trump's administration were \"torn up by former President Trump,\" and that White House officials had to tape them back together. Not all the torn-up documents were reconstructed, NARA says. The boxes contained some materials that were part of \"special access programs,\" known as SAP, which is a classification that includes protocols to significantly limit who would have access to the information.\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nNews outlets, including CNN, report that NARA asked the Justice Department to investigate Trump's handling of White House records and whether he violated the Presidential Records Act and other laws related to classified information. The Presidential Records Act requires all records created by a sitting president to be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administration.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nNARA informs the Justice Department that some of the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago included classified material. NARA also tells the department that, despite being warned it was illegal, Trump tore up documents while he was president, and that senior officials in the Trump administration did not properly preserve their social media messages, draft tweets and deleted tweets.\n\nApril and May 2022\n\nOn April 7, NARA publicly acknowledges for the first time that the Justice Department is involved, and news outlets report that prosecutors have launched a criminal probe into Trump's mishandling of classified documents. Around this time, FBI agents quietly interview Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago about the handling of presidential records as part of their widening investigation.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nNews outlets report that investigators subpoenaed NARA for access to the classified documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The subpoena, which is part of the process to allow investigators to take possession of the documents from the NARA, is the first public indication of the Justice Department using a grand jury in its investigation.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nFour investigators, including a top Justice Department counterintelligence official, visit Mar-a-Lago seeking more information about classified material that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators meet with Trump's attorneys and look around the basement room where the documents are being stored. Trump briefly stops by the meeting to say hello to the officials, but he does not answer any questions. During the meeting, the federal officials serve a grand jury subpoena for some of the sensitive national security documents on the premises, and they take away the subpoenaed documents.\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\nTrump's attorneys receive a letter from federal investigators, asking them to further secure the room where documents are being stored. In response, Trump aides add a padlock to the room in the basement of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nFederal investigators serve a subpoena to the Trump Organization, demanding surveillance video from Mar-a-Lago. Trump's company complies with the subpoena and turns over the footage. CNN has reported that this was part of an effort to gather information about who had access to areas at the club where government documents were stored. The subpoena was served on June 22, according to The Wall Street Journal\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nThe FBI executes a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago -- a major escalation of the classified documents investigation. The search focused on the area of the club where Trump's offices and personal quarters are located. Federal agents remove boxes of material from the property. The search was the first time in American history that a former president's home was searched as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nAfter three days of silence, Attorney General Merrick Garland makes a brief public statement about the investigation. He reveals that he personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant, and pushes back against what he called \"unfounded attacks on the professionalism of the FBI and Justice Department.\" Garland also announces that the Justice Department will ask a judge to unseal some of the search warrant documents, for the sake of transparency.

We have ...", "text": "The FBI's execution of a search warrant Monday at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida has prompted questions about the methods federal law enforcement officials use in their investigations.\n\nHere are answers.\n\nHow does a federal search warrant work?\n\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, federal law enforcement officials may seek search warrants if they believe criminal evidence they seek could be moved, concealed, altered or destroyed if they used less intrusive measures to obtain it.\n\nFirst, they must swear, under oath, to a series of facts in an affidavit to a federal magistrate judge or district court judge in the area where the warrant is to be executed. The application must show \"probable cause\" that a crime has been committed and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found at the location to be searched.\n\nIn this case, the warrant could have been approved by a judge in Washington, D.C., because the FBI investigation is believed to focus on classified White House documents, said Columbia Law School professor John Coffee.\n\nSearch warrant applications limit the search to the specific evidence being sought – a safeguard aimed at preventing investigators from conducting overly broad searches.\n\nSearch warrants are not an indication someone is guilty.\n\nFBI agents seeking search warrants involving high-level officials often will consult with federal prosecutors before proceeding.\n\n\"For someone like the former president, it is highly likely that investigators would review a search warrant application at the highest levels of the Department of Justice,\" said Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University and a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general.\n\nSearch warrants are secret until federal investigators execute them. And they can't be challenged by the person whose home, business or other location is searched.\n\n\"It can be a complete surprise,\" Saltzburg said. \"It usually is.\"\n\nAfter the warrant has been executed, investigators must file a document with the court that lists each piece of evidence that was seized. They must also leave an inventory of the seizures at the location where the search was conducted.\n\nSearch warrants may be challenged in court afterward if there is evidence investigators failed to meet the probable-cause requirement or otherwise misled the judge who approved the warrant.\n\nIn a federal indictment unsealed earlier this month, federal prosecutors charged members of the Louisville Metro Police Department with falsifying the affidavit they filed to obtain a search warrant for the home of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by officers who executed the warrant.\n\nSuch allegations of law enforcement misconduct \"are very rare, but they do happen,\" Saltzburg said.\n\nWhat's a subpoena?\n\nFederal law enforcement officials issue subpoenas – legal demands for evidence – when there's less potential that the material might be destroyed or hidden.\n\nUnlike search warrants, the person who's served with a subpoena may file a court motion to quash the demand on grounds that it's overly intrusive or burdensome to provide the information being sought.\n\nThere's no public indication Trump was subpoenaed for the material FBI agents seized in Monday's search. Andrew Weissmann, a professor at the NYU School of Law and a former lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel’s Office, said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland likely asked FBI investigators why a search warrant and not a subpoena was necessary for the material sought from Trump.\n\n\"He must have gotten a really compelling answer that there was a danger the material would not be provided in response to a subpoena,\" Weissmann said.\n\nAttorneys representing Trump have filed court challenges to numerous subpoenas. Among them were legal demands for Trump's financial and business records by a congressional committee and the New York Attorney General's Office.\n\nA New York court ordered Trump to pay a contempt fine after he failed to comply with the attorney general's subpoena. The court subsequently lifted the contempt finding.\n\nTop DOJ officials probably approved sear:Ex-Bush AG Gonzales says Mar-a-Lago search likely had approval from ‘highest level’- live updates\n\nTrump to dine with House GOP caucus:Donald Trump to meet with House Republicans following FBI search of Mar-a-Lago home\n\nWatergate parallel?:Watergate 'in reverse'? Historians and legal analysts pan Trump's claims and point to legal peril ahead\n\nHow do federal grand juries work?\n\nThe Fifth Amendment of the U.S Constitution provides that no one \"shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime\" without a presentment or indictment voted by a grand jury.\n\nIf federal investigators gather sufficient evidence to proceed in court with a criminal case against Trump, the former president would likely be charged in a federal grand jury indictment. There has been no public sign that such a case is imminent.\n\nPotential grand jurors are summoned to court to serve on panels for varying time periods. A grand jury consists of 23 people, and votes of 12 members are required to charge someone with a federal crime.\n\nGrand juries have authority to issue subpoenas that require testimony by specific witnesses. Successful challenges of such grand jury subpoenas are rare, Saltzburg said.\n\nProsecutors typically question witnesses who appear before grand juries. Grand jurors themselves may also take part in the questioning.\n\nGrand jury proceedings are secret. But witnesses who testify before the panels are not barred from discussing their testimony.\n\n\"Grand juries can gather a lot of information before anyone knows about the proceeding,\" Saltzburg said. \"It's an enormously powerful investigative tool.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/opinions/fbi-search-ominous-warnings-democracy-ghitis/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Ominous warnings after search of Trump's home make no ...", "text": "Frida Ghitis , ( @fridaghitis ) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) When news broke this week that the FBI had executed a search warrant at former President Donald Trump's Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago, a wave of ominous warnings exploded across right-wing media, fueled by the former president and his acolytes.\n\nTrump called it \"the weaponization of the Justice system,\" arguing that a criminal case against him threatened to unravel American democracy. It was a curious claim for a man who launched his 2016 presidential campaign on the chant of \"Lock her up!\"-- calling for the imprisonment of his then-political rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe claim that enforcing the laws against a former president was a modern crossing of the Rubicon, a turning point in history that would inflict an unhealable wound on US democracy, was one of two warnings unsettling the country since Monday.\n\nThe second one is more of a threat: Trump's most militant followers are openly calling for vengeance, even violence, while his suit-and-tie backers stoke their anger -- much as they did before January 6 -- claiming the republic is under the gravest of authoritarian threats. They warn, in their coda, that the GOP will retaliate against Democrats if and/or when Republicans take power again.\n\nShould Americans be worried? Yes and no.\n\nWhile we shouldn't play into Trump's false claims of the weaponization of law enforcement, we should be fearful of how his supporters are responding to the FBI search. In fact, the threats of violence in response to an FBI investigation serve as proof -- as if more were needed -- that the ecosystem surrounding Trump is a danger to the nation.\n\nTrump is in hot water, in part, because he has a well-established track record of pushing the bounds of the law. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe said on CNN , \"The first thing I thought of when I heard of the search warrant was, which investigation might this be a part of? There are so many options here, it is literally head-spinning.\"\n\nAnd, to be frank, it's been a terrible week for the former president. First, he had to deal with the FBI search of his Florida home, in connection with government documents, including some allegedly classified, that he took from the White House. Then an appeals court ruled against him , saying his tax returns must be turned over to Congress. And, on Wednesday, as part of a civil investigation led by the New York attorney general, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, refusing to testify in a deposition. Friendly reminder: Trump once said , \"If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?\"\n\nThe White House says Biden had no idea about the unannounced FBI search, which is as it should be. The Justice Department is meant to be independent of politics. Trump's son Eric said he knows the White House, and he doesn't buy it. In the White House he knows (Trump's), the president would be involved in such a decision.\n\nThe claim that enforcing the law against Trump turns the US into a \"Third-World\" nation, as Trump opined, is rather the opposite of the truth. In strong democracies, no one is above the law. That's why other countries -- from France to Israel to South Korea -- have indicted, convicted and, in some cases, even imprisoned, former presidents and prime ministers. Their democracies were stronger for it, sending a message to those who obtain enormous power that they are not beyond the reach of the law.\n\nMishandling government materials is a crime. A former top official in Bill Clinton's presidency was prosecuted in 2005 for destroying three copies of one document. At the time, that was a misdemeanor. But, in 2018, Trump signed a law making it a felony. He notably did this in the wake of his attacks on Hillary Clinton and her \" careless \" handling of government emails.\n\nTrump took 15 boxes of material with him to Mar-a-Lago, which were collected earlier this year. On Monday, federal agents took away an additional 12 boxes from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe argument that it's all part of a nefarious plot to go after Trump is absurd. Obtaining a search warrant is no easy task. Prosecutors have to convince a judge that they have probable cause that a crime was committed and that the evidence of that crime is on the premises.\n\nThe fact Trump is hinting that the FBI may have planted evidence in Mar-a-Lago, suggests he may be worried that damning material was found.\n\nDespite no evidence that the FBI did anything outside the strict bounds of the law, right-wing media and Republican Trumpists have rushed to ignite a firestorm of conspiracy theories and hyperbolic accusations about a country supposedly careening into tyranny.\n\nPreposterous and unconscionable analogies to Nazi Germany became the order of the day. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, among others, compared the federal government to Hitler's Gestapo. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas warned , \"they're coming for YOU.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who could become Speaker of the House after the November elections, seemed to threaten retaliation, telling Attorney General Merrick Garland to \"preserve your documents and clear your calendar,\" ahead of a possible probe. And Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called on Garland to resign or be impeached.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.

A right-wing podcaster with almost 2 million Twitter followers posted ,\"Today is war.\" Others wrote, \"Summertime was made for killing fields,\" and \" lock and load .\"\n\nOnline searches for \"civil war\" seemed to decline rapidly after a Tuesday peak, but the risks cannot be discounted. A January poll found 40% of Republicans believe violence against the government is sometimes justified. (Some 23% of Democrats agree.) Many of these are the same people that are passionate about their firearms.\n\nTrump's legal troubles are only getting worse. He has already shown his ability to mobilize his most dangerous backers, but no country should allow such a threat to curtail enforcement of its laws.

Apple AirPods Pro\n\nLast year, Apple AirPods were probably the most coveted products of the holiday season, but this year the upgraded AirPods Pro will be all the rage.

And some have embraced remote work, allowing employees to work from home full time or part of the time.\n\nBut many workers are deciding to chart their own course. Some have found that they love working from home and never want to step foot in an office again. Others are itching to go back -- missing the in-person collaboration and socializing with peers. And some want a little bit of both worlds.\n\nThat has prompted many workers to rethink or even switch careers and make some other big changes. Here's a look at how the pandemic reshaped people's careers in ways they never expected:\n\nMoving cross country to start a new life\n\nAfter her job went fully remote, Chelsea Pruitt decided to move from California to Alabama.\n\nChelsea Pruitt, 31, has lived in California for nearly her entire life. Now, she's headed to Alabama.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, Pruitt had thought about moving, but it wasn't until she started working remotely that the decision became a lot easier to make.\n\n\"I feel like my chapter in life in San Francisco is changing,\" she said. \"My perspective on things is changing. The things I want out of life are changing.\"\n\nPruitt started working for long-term housing rental company Zeus Living in January 2020, right before the pandemic hit the US. At the time, she was going into the office five days a week. But once the pandemic began to shut things down in March, she started working remotely full time.\n\nThat was just what Pruitt needed to make her decision. She had visited a co-worker in Birmingham, Alabama, a few times and decided that was the place she wanted to live.\n\n\"I love the vibe of the city, the change, and I loved [that] it's more leisurely, slow and less stressful and obviously a lot more affordable [than San Francisco], which I am really excited about.\"\n\nThe high cost of living in San Francisco meant she always had to have roommates. \"In San Francisco, I don't see myself being able to own a home unless I am married and have a dual income,\" she said.\n\nBut since her pay will remain the same after the move to Birmingham and the cost of living will be significantly less, she'll be able to save more, and hopefully buy a home of her own and pay down her student loans.\n\n\"I am looking forward to that mental relief knowing that my cost of living is lower and I can save more,\" she said.\n\nFinally taking the leap\n\nCarlos Ortiz started his own consulting business during the pandemic.\n\nCarlos Ortiz had been working as an inspector with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 19 years before the pandemic hit. He had been considering leaving his job for a few years, but was nervous about making such a big change.\n\nA lot of my friends are entrepreneurs and business people and I've never worked in the private industry ... so I decided, let me give it a shot\" Carlos Ortiz\n\n\"I started re-evaluating life and opportunities,\" Ortiz, 48, said of that time. \"[But] I was very comfortable getting a paycheck every two weeks.\"\n\nBut in April 2020, when businesses were shutting their offices down across the country, he realized he wanted more control over his life -- especially when it came to his work. So he began planning the launch of his own business.\n\n\"A lot of my friends are entrepreneurs and business people and I've never worked in the private industry ... so I decided, let me give it a shot,\" he said.\n\nAt the start of 2021, he quit his full-time job and launched a consulting business to advise companies on how to comply with government regulations.\n\nTo help provide some financial cushion as he launched the new venture, Ortiz had been saving up unused leave, which he got paid out for when he left his job.\n\nAt first, \"it was very scary,\" he said. Now, he's making slightly less than he was at his old job, but he's only working 20 hours a week.\n\nOrtiz said he also has more control over his schedule, and since most of his business is done over the phone and on video calls, he's been able to work from anywhere. So far, he's worked from Geneva, Switzerland, San Antonio and Anchorage, Alaska.\n\n\"I am getting back into my art and reading a lot more ... and exercising a lot more. And I am doing my chores as I've always done, but now I am just not exhausted.\"\n\nEnjoying the hybrid life\n\nAfter working from home for two years, John Pearson missed the collaboration and socialization that happens in the office.\n\nJohn Pearson used to have a hard deadline of 6:00 a.m. in order to be out of his driveway and on his way to work each morning.\n\n\"Otherwise, the commute goes from an hour to something much worse,\" said Pearson, 55, who is a senior vice president at PTC, an industrial software company in Boston.\n\nBut for the past two years, his commute has been a quick walk down the hall to his home office.\n\nI can get through more complex problem solving much faster in a room with two or three people and a whiteboard than I can through Zoom\" John Pearson\n\nAt first, he said he was more productive and less distracted when working from home. But now that he has periodically started going into the office, he realizes there are some advantages to in-person work.\n\n\"I can get through more complex problem solving much faster in a room with two or three people and a whiteboard than I can through Zoom,\" he said.\n\nHe also realized he missed talking to people in the office about simple things, like their kids or what they've been watching on TV. \"When you are jumping from 30-minute call to 30-minute call on video, you just don't do that as much.\"\n\nHis company plans to offer a flexible model to its employees -- something Pearson prefers. His goal is to be in the office two to three days a week.\n\nAnd as much as he didn't like the commute, he started to realize the role it played. \"It really is a firm break in which you walk away and you close your laptop.\"\n\nThe WFH convert\n\nRashmi Bhankhede used to prefer being in the office five days a week. Now she hopes to work remotely full-time.\n\nRashmi Bhankhede never really liked the idea of working from home.\n\n\"Before the pandemic...I definitely preferred working face-to-face in this open-office environment,\" she said. \"I thought it was the most productive way for everyone.\"\n\nAs a senior manager of software engineering at Capital One, she manages two teams. She used to want her teams to come into the office to collaborate, discuss projects, hold feedback sessions and interact on a more social level. But the pandemic has changed her approach.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you are. If you have good processes to connect with your peers and [direct] reports, working remote can be very productive\" Rashmi Bhankhede\n\nAfter two years of working from home, she's hoping to make remote work permanent. Capital One has said it will be on a hybrid schedule when it reopens its offices.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where you are. If you have good processes to connect with your peers and [direct] reports, working remote can be very productive,\" said Bhankhede, 43.\n\nShe added that the flexibility helps her manage her time better and that her team has become closer -- even though they haven't seen each other in person for two years.\n\nTo better define the boundary between work and her personal life, Bhankhede gets dressed in her work clothes every morning and changes at the end of the day, followed by a relaxing activity like a walk.\n\nWorking from home has also meant spending more time with her two sons and learning new hobbies since she no longer has to commute.\n\n\"I started growing peppers and tomatoes and cucumbers ... and got back into sewing,\" she said. \"I am still not good at it.\"\n\nTurning a hobby into a new career\n\nCody Irion went back to school and switched careers during the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic hit right as Cody Irion's busy season was about to start.\n\nIn 2020, he owned a horse transportation business in North Carolina. Typically, April through August were his most lucrative months, but when stay-at-home orders started sweeping the US, he quickly decided to close his business, sell the equipment and go back to school to get a degree in computer science.\n\n\"I had the choice of going into a massive amount of debt to keep going or change careers,\" said Irion, 35. \"I had started learning software development as a hobby and I really enjoyed it, so I didn't hesitate.\"\n\nHe enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and since the majority of his classes have been virtual, he didn't have to move closer to campus until his final year, saving him a lot of money.\n\nHe also believes he had more internship opportunities last summer since so many companies were still operating remotely.\n\nIrion is set to graduate this May and already has a job lined up at a financial services company.\n\n\"I had never even considered software engineering before I started it as a hobby because I grew up in Southern Illinois with race horses,\" he said. \"I knew nothing about the industry other than I liked computers and I started learning it and realized I was pretty good at it.\"\n\nTurning a side business into a full-time job\n\nMabel Frias (pictured on the left with her sister) left her full-time job during the pandemic to fully commit to her side business, Luna Magic.\n\nMabel Frias had been juggling two jobs at the beginning of the pandemic, but eventually had to make a decision: stay with the security and safety of her full-time job or pursue a riskier life as an entrepreneur.\n\nIn March 2020, Frias was a little more than a year into working what she described as her \"dream job\" as director of digital merchandising at lingerie brand, Savage X Fenty. Meanwhile, she was also trying to grow Luna Magic, a beauty brand she launched with her sister in 2019.\n\nBut as the pandemic forced many workers to do their jobs remotely, Luna Magic started gaining more traction and demanding more of her time.\n\n\"Because we were in a Zoom culture, people still wanted from the face up to look good. You still wanted to have a level of presentation while you are on the screen,\" Frias, 35, said.\n\nWhile working two jobs meant long hours during the week and weekends, Frias was nervous about leaving her full-time job and the financial security it brought. So she set certain benchmarks for Luna Magic to hit, including partnerships and business opportunities, before she could feel comfortable walking away.\n\n\"Part of the challenges a lot of entrepreneurs have is they jump to soon,\" she said. \"I don't like to have economic anxiety. I am also a mother and practical about these things.\"\n\nSoon enough, the company was meeting her goals. In 2020, Walmart.com started selling the company's products, which includes makeup and other cosmetics. And in 2021, Walmart and Target started carrying products in some stores, as well as online.\n\n\"I had to trust myself. I liked the idea of growing something from scratch,\" she said.\n\nIn 2020, Frias applied to be on ABC's Shark Tank and was accepted. The show, which features entrepreneurs pitching their businesses to a panel of investors, aired in January 2021 -- the same day Frias quit her job.\n\n\"I love the magic of creating something out of nothing. I saw our company as we get to bring even more beauty into the world at a moment when people are looking for it,\" Frias said.\n\nJust graduated and can't wait to work in person\n\nRachel Zipfel started her new job working fully remote, but hopes to eventually be in the office five days a week.\n\nRachel Zipfel finished her college courses in the same place she started her first full-time job: in a room at her parents' house.\n\nZipfel, 23, graduated from the University of Missouri, St. Louis in August 2021 with a degree in marketing. But because of the pandemic, her classes were remote for nearly her last two years of college.\n\nShe's now working remotely for a digital marketing agency and has met her colleagues roughly five times in person. She feels like working from home has made it harder to get acclimated to the working world.\n\nWhen she first started, she found it challenging to learn the ropes.\n\n\"If you are trying to ask someone a question, you don't know what they are doing on the other side of the computer, so what could be a five-minute question in person [could turn] into maybe two hours of waiting for an answer,\" she said.\n\nZipfel started going into the office about once a week in January, and said she feels more productive. She hopes to eventually be there five days a week.\n\n\"I've noticed a world of difference,\" she said. \"There are none of the distractions that are at home. It's so much easier to get work done. If the person is there that I need to talk to I can get my question answered in five seconds versus two hours. I love being in the office and I cant wait for it to be back open again.\"\n\nQuit a job that wanted him back in the office\n\nWhen Ryan Bernsten found out his employer wanted him to come back into the office, he found a new job.\n\nRyan Bernsten had only been working at his new job as a copywriter for a few weeks in March 2020 when he was sent home to work remotely.\n\nAt the time, he was worried about how it would work. \"Work from home? What would that even look like? I am going to miss out on all the social interaction -- I am new here,\" he recalled.\n\nIf they aren't going to validate that I enjoy working from home, that I am better at home, and I enjoy my lifestyle at home, I need to find a job that will,\" Ryan Bernsten\n\nBut eventually he adapted. Now two years later, he prefers remote work.\n\nWorking from home, he said, enables him to be more productive and have a better work-life balance. So when he learned he was going to be required to return to the office a few days a week, he started looking for a new job that allowed him to stay remote.\n\n\"If they aren't going to validate that I enjoy working from home, that I am better at home, and I enjoy my lifestyle at home, I need to find a job that will,\" he said.\n\nIt took him less than a month to get a new, fully remote job.\n\n\"I never ever have to go back to the office,\" Bernsten, 29, said. \"You get to see people at their best. If we fly to San Francisco for a meeting, the adrenaline is there, we are excited to see people, we're going to make it count. But you don't have to see people every day ... when they have a cold, are in a bad mood or in a fight with their partner.\"\n\nAnd not only did he get added flexibility, he also got a higher salary.\n\n\"I don't believe everyone needs to work from home,\" he said. \"But some people work better from home. I never wake up dreading work because I am in the comfort of my home.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated how long Mabel Frias worked at her previous employer.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel", "Carlos Ortiz", "John Pearson", "Rashmi Bhankhede", "Ryan Bernsten"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/12/where-is-mike-pence/6740921002/", "title": "Mike Pence: Where is he, what is he doing in life after Donald Trump?", "text": "Former Vice President Mike Pence has been a popular topic of conversation lately.\n\nThere are reports of Pence being homeless since he is no longer vice president and he sold his Indiana home when he became Indiana's governor in 2013.\n\nPlus, many wonder if he'll still be involved in politics or if Pence is planning to ride off into the sunset.\n\nHere's what you need to know about former Vice President Mike Pence:\n\nWhere is Mike Pence?\n\nPence and his wife, Karen, are currently living in northern Virginia where the former vice president has opened a transition office, according to USA Today.\n\nOutgoing presidents and vice presidents are allowed six months of services to complete any official business.\n\nWhile no exact locations has been given, Pence plans to return to his home state of Indiana this summer, according to IndyStar. He made a quick trip to speak with Hoosiers in Columbus, Ind., on Jan. 20.\n\n\"I've already promised Karen will be moving back to Indiana come this summer,\" Pence said. \"There's no place like home.\"\n\nComing to a close:How Pence's hometown views his legacy\n\nWhat is Pence doing now?\n\nOnce his vice presidential transition is finished, Pence will be a \"distinguished visiting fellow\" at the Heritage Foundation, according to USA Today.\n\nThe plan is for Pence to advise policy experts, deliver policy speeches and write a monthly column for the conservative think tank.\n\nPence credits the Heritage Foundation for shaping his conservative philosophy, as the foundation was used to shape the Indiana Policy Review. Pence was president of the Indiana foundation and a radio talk show host before joining Congress in 2000.\n\nHow is Mike Pence?\n\nPence was pretty emotional during his 15-minute speech in Columbus on Jan. 20.\n\nAccording to IndyStar, Pence's voice was \"cracking\" and he was \"holding back tears\" at the podium.\n\nHe congratulated President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris before thanking former President Donald Trump for his opportunity to \"serve the nation.\"\n\nDonald Trump:What the former President said about Mike Pence on final day\n\n“While we don't know what the future holds,\" Pence said, \"we know who holds the future. I'm absolutely confident that the best days, for this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, are yet to come.”\n\nWhat did Donald Trump say about Mike Pence?\n\nTrump only spoke for about 10 minutes during his final speech as president, according to USA Today. His comments on Pence were very brief.\n\n\"I want to thank our vice president, Mike Pence and Karen,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat is Mike Pence's net worth?\n\nIn 2019, Forbes reported Pence didn't have much besides $65,000 in index funds and under $15,000 in a bank account. However, his state and federal pensions working as a government official total about $85,000 per year for the rest of his life.\n\nAccording to Forbes' calculations, those pensions would make Pence worth about $1.2 million but he still owes on a six-figure student loan debt. Factor in a payoff of those student loans, Forbes places Pence's net worth at $1 million.\n\nChris Sims is a digital sports producer at IndyStar.

Arvon, the state's highest point at 1,980 feet, is an adventure in itself, requiring a 27-mile drive from L'Anse, which is in the Keweenaw Bay of Lake Superior.

Run a festive summer road race\n\nSome summer road races have been going strong since the 1970s and draw thousands each year. Two of the most venerable are the Crim Festival of Races in Flint (Aug. 26) and Volkslaufe Run in Frankenmuth (July 4). Both offer runners a first-class experience and a variety of distances. The Crim (crim.org/races), which began in 1977, offers distances from one-mile to 10 miles. Volkslaufe (volkslaufe.runfrankenmuth.org), which dates back to 1976, has races from 2K through 20K. Both can help prepare for the Detroit Free Press/Chemical Bank Marathon (http://www.freepmarathon.com/) in October.\n\n42. Rock climb in Grand Ledge\n\nOne of the top rock climbing destinations in the Midwest is located in Grand Ledge on the banks of the Grand River at Oak Park. The 300-million-year-old sandstone and quartzite, 35-foot ledges offer some 50 climbing routes as described on climbmidwest.com. See grandledgeclimbing.com for details.\n\n43. Check out the Moneyball Pro-Am League\n\nMany of the state’s top college basketball players, some professionals and incoming freshmen will take part in the 14th annual Moneyball Pro-Am League at Aim High Sports in Dimondale, outside Lansing, from June 27-Aug. 3. Rivalries are set aside. Last year, for example, Michigan’s Derrick Walton and Mark Donnal became teammates with Michigan State’s Josh Langford and Gavin Schilling. MSU’s Miles Bridges is bound to steal the show again after averaging a league-best 31.1 points per game a year ago. A women’s pro-am league was added last year. Admission is free. See moneyballsportswear.com/moneyball-pro-am for details.\n\n44. Watch racing at Milan Dragway\n\nFor more than 50 years, Milan Dragway has been a great place to experience drag racing’s ear-splitting power as dragster’s engines rev to more than 130 decibels just prior to roaring out of the box, front ends lifting a few inches off the ground as they cover a quarter-mile in less than 10 seconds. Milan Dragway has events throughout the summer. See milandragway.com for details.\n\n45. Play pickup basketball at Joe Dumars Fieldhouse\n\nIn search of the ideal place to find a pickup basketball game?

Experience Detroit Hyrdrofest’s new format\n\nUnlimited Hydroplanes return to the Detroit River for the 101st Detroit Hydrofest on Aug. 25-27, skimming the water at 200 m.p.h. High-powered turbo engines produce 3,000 horsepower and leave a 60-foot-high, 300-foot-long wall of water in their wake. The format has switched this year from one race held over two days to two races in two days. There are two sets of preliminary heats Aug. 26, followed by a winner-take-all final for the President’s Cup. Aug. 27 features three sets of preliminary heats before a winner-take-all final for the Gold Cup. See detroitboatraces.com for ticket prices and other information.\n\n47.

The Potawatomi Trail in Pinckney Recreation Area is an option. The 17.5-mile loop is popular with mountain bikers due to its challenging, varied terrain as it passes over rolling hills and past streams and several inland lakes. The trail also varies from hard-packed dirt to sand with exposed roots and rocks. Hikers can use the loop for a long day hike or can break up their trek by spending the night at a walk-in, lakeside campground. See michigandnr.com/parksandtrails for maps and details.\n\n49.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAfter months of quarantine and social distancing, many of us feel finally somewhat adjusted to the \"new normal\" caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. And while stores and online retailers are slowly starting to restock their shelves (physical and virtual) now that the initial chaos has subsided, there are still some products that continue to sell out as we roll into the summer season.\n\nSome of the staples—like hand sanitizer and face masks—continue to be hard to find along with seasonal favorites like pool floats and roller skates. Here at Reviewed, we've spent the last few months endlessly searching for where to buy all of the things quickly selling out, keeping you updated on the best places to buy whatever it is you've been looking for. And now as states start to reopen and there's a new surge in demand for certain products, we've turned our attention to those hard-to-find items. Below are 13 popular things that are high in demand and where you can still buy them.\n\n1. Face masks\n\nWith more and more people venturing out to shops and restaurants now, face masks have become a hot commodity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that you wear a cloth face covering whenever you're in public (and some places require them) so many retailers have begun selling fabric masks in all different styles, colors, and prints. However, it's not uncommon to see \"sold out\" on many of those retailers' websites. We scoured the Internet to find 55 of the best places to buy face masks online right now, from Anthropologie to Etsy. Three of our favorites are below, including Nordstrom's new plain black masks perfect for adults and kids alike.\n\n2. Pool floats\n\nEven if you don't have a pool in your backyard, many states have reopened (or are in the process of reopening) public pools and beaches. And for that, you might want a fun pool float or two, which have been selling out since mid-May. Some of the year's most popular pool floats (which we rounded up based on reviews and ratings) include the over-the-top floating cabana from luxury brand Funboy and a ride-on oversize unicorn from Sunnylife.\n\n3. Weights and workout gear\n\nAs soon as gyms announced they were closing back in March due to COVID-19, people rushed to outfit their home gyms. Dumbbells, kettle bells, resistance bands, barbells, and exercise mats were all selling out—and even with some states reopening gyms and fitness studios, exercise equipment is still tough to find as people are hesitant to return to public workout spaces. Fortunately, some of the basics (like weights and bands) have been restocked at retailers like Target and Amazon.\n\n4. Hand sanitizer\n\nAccording to the CDC's latest coronavirus guidelines (which were just updated last week), you should always have hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol with you when you're out and about. But trying to find said hand sanitizer isn't so easy amid such high demand. Our experts have spent the last few months tracking where to buy hand sanitizer online so you can stay safe and healthy on the go.\n\n5. Roller skates\n\nOne of the most unexpected—but now also one of the hottest—trends right now is roller skating. The nostalgic outdoor activity has spiked in popularity as people opt outside (rather than the gym or the treadmill). Many retailers are sold out of skates but you can still get them from places like Amazon (this classic pair has a 4.4-star rating from thousands of reviewers) or Urban Outfitters (this trendy Moxi pair comes in the most playful colors!).\n\n6. Bikes\n\nAlong the same lines as roller skates, bikes are becoming a must-have for summertime now that outdoor exercise is so trendy. And according to experts, there's a bike shortage across the country as a result—some are even calling bikes the new toilet paper (!!). However, there are still retailers with bikes in stock, like Dick's Sporting Goods or Walmart. But you might want to click \"add to your cart\" soon, given the increasing demand and limited supply.\n\n7. Yeast\n\nIf you've been on social media at all the last few months, you're well aware that bread baking has been the hobby of quarantine. And one of the main ingredients every home baker needs? Yeast. It's been selling out in grocery stores and online as people try their hand at everything from baguettes to sourdough starters—which is why we've been constantly monitoring and updating our thorough list of all the places you can still buy yeast online.\n\n8. Inflatable pools and sprinklers\n\nNow that it's summer, people are moving from indoors to outdoors—and that means backyard entertainment is a big deal for 2020. As a result, inflatable pools and sprinklers are all the rage and are hard to find both in stores and online. To help you stay cool (and have fun) all season long, we've compiled a list of some of the best pools and sprinklers you can buy, including the trendy designer pools from Minnidip and the oversize unicorn sprinkler that's been popping up everywhere.\n\n9. Bike shorts\n\nAnother retro trend, bike shorts are making a comeback, with celebrities and style influencers showing off their colorful spandex. As a result, the shorts have been selling out fast at many retailers—but you can still find them at a handful. Some of the top-rated picks include these new bike shorts from cult-favorite Everlane and these flashy bike shorts from luxury athletic brand Bandier.\n\n10. Puzzles\n\nOne of the best ways to pass the time in quarantine—that doesn't involve staring at a screen—is putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Because it's something you can do solo (if you're quarantined alone) or with a group (if you're quarantined with family or roommates), puzzles have been flying off shelves and tough to come by. If you're looking for where to buy puzzles online, our experts have been continuously updating our list of the most popular puzzles that are still in stock, including this challenging-yet-stunning Frank Lloyd Wright puzzle or this kid-friendly cat puzzle from Target.\n\n11. Nintendo Switch\n\nThe Nintendo Switch has always been popular but it's recently skyrocketed in popularity thanks to both the release of Animal Crossing and to the fact that quarantine has us all searching for new entertainment. The Switch has become so sought-after, in fact, that it's sold out almost everywhere (unless you're willing to pay steep price hikes from a third-party or reseller). Fortunately, however, here at Reviewed we've been tracking the gaming console for weeks and have rounded up where you can find the Switch in stock right now online.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch Lite from Best Buy for $199\n\n12. Loungewear\n\nLoungewear like matching sweatsuits, comfy pullovers, and relaxed joggers has become our work-from-home uniform—and now that it's warmer, shorts sets and lighter-weight pieces have been selling out like crazy. While stock is limited at many retailers, you can still snag some staples for yourself. After testing some of the top-selling pieces out there, our editors' favorite loungewear brands include Aerie, Lou + Grey, Brooklinen, and the cult-favorite Barefoot Dreams.\n\n13. Freezers and freezer chests\n\nIf you're looking to buy a freezer, you'll likely have to wait quite awhile. Ever since the coronavirus pandemic began, freezers and freezer chests have been sold out, with many on back-order for months and months. You can still find them at a few places, though, if you know where you look. Many of Home Depot's options are back-ordered until the fall but Best Buy has some popular picks including this chest from Insignia with over 1,000 rave reviews.\n\nGet the Insignia 3.5 Cu. Ft. Chest Freezer from Best Buy for $149.99\n\n14. Backyard toys\n\nAny parent who's tried to buy a water table or a trampoline in the last few weeks has likely been frustrated—because many backyard toys are selling out everywhere, thanks to parents who are desperate to keep their kids entertained this summer. Our parenting editor, however, managed to find a few left in stock, including this island-themed water table and this backyard trampoline with a net for older kids.\n\n15. Patio furniture and grills\n\nWith people spending more time in their backyards this summer (thanks to limited restaurant options and maybe even cancelled vacations), retailers say they've seen a big spike in patio furniture sales. Many are having trouble keeping popular pieces like grills and patio chairs on the shelves, as they sell out over and over. Not only have our Reviewed experts rounded up the best-selling patio furniture of 2020 you can still get online, but we've also tested plenty of grills and found the Weber Spirit II E-310 to be the best. You can still buy it right now at Home Depot.\n\nGet the Weber Spirit II E-310 from Wayfair for $479\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

And he knows some people probably don't even consider skateboarding to be a sport in the first place.\n\nBut Reynolds hopes this summer's Tokyo Olympics will help change those perceptions.\n\n\"It's really exciting for skateboarding to be kind of recognized as, like, a real sport,\" the 22-year-old said in April.\n\nINSIDE SCOOP IN TOKYO:Subscribe to our Olympic newsletter now\n\nTEXT WITH US AT TOKYO OLYMPICS: Subscribe to texts, where we’ll be your official guide to the Games\n\nSkateboarding is one of four sports that will be contested at the Olympics for the first time this summer, stepping onto the largest stage in global sports. Surfing, rock climbing and karate are the others, while baseball and softball — which had previously been in the Olympics but were later discontinued — are also returning to the Olympic program.\n\nLong perceived as the go-to sports for rebels and free spirits, the likes of skateboarding, rock climbing and surfing have long since gone mainstream. They have international federations, world championships and fans around the globe.\n\nTheir inclusion at the Olympics, however, serves as a key sign of legitimacy — and an opportunity for expansive growth.\n\n\"It will be broadcast to a bigger audience, so more people will see it,\" surfer Carissa Moore said at Team USA's media summit in April, when asked about the sport's inclusion in the Olympics. \"Hopefully more people will fall in love with it and actually tune in on a more regular basis. And maybe it will even inspire them to get out and try it.\"\n\nYet in the tight-knit communities of each sport, there are also lingering concerns, particularly among veteran participants.\n\nSome fear that the Olympics will co-opt or alter the unique cultures of sports like surfing, skateboarding or rock climbing. Others worry that their sports might actually become too popular — resulting in overcrowding at skateparks or popular outdoor rock climbing routes.\n\n\"It’s a little controversial, I think, for sure,\" Kyra Condie, one of four U.S. climbers who will compete in Tokyo, told USA TODAY Sports. \"We kind of love having this tight-knit, smaller community — especially when you’re going outside to these areas in the outdoors, that can get really crowded, stuff like that.\n\n\"But I think it’s overall going to be a really good thing for the sport. It’s a sport that a lot of people love and enjoy ... And to have it get more exposure will be really cool.\"\n\nGoing where the young people are\n\nThe overwhelming majority of climbers, skaters, surfers and karatekas bound for Tokyo this summer did not start competing with Olympic dreams in mind. They simply fell in love with their sports, and the Olympic opportunity later fell into their laps.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee voted to add the four sports to its Olympic program for Tokyo in 2016, while also adding a number of new events in existing sports, such as 3-on-3 basketball or mixed-gender relays in track and field. Another new sport — breaking, more commonly known as breakdancing — will make its debut at the Paris Olympics in 2024.\n\nIOC president Thomas Bach framed the inclusion of the new sports as part of the organization's broader agenda, and an attempt to connect with young audiences.\n\n\"Youth today has so many options for their leisure time that you cannot just wait for these young people to come to sport,\" Bach said in 2016. \"You have to go, and sport has to go, where they are. And with this organization, we go where the people are and where the young people are.\"\n\nMany athletes see the Olympic inclusion of their sports as part of a natural evolution. Though the likes of skateboarding and rock climbing might have initially been the hobbies of rebels — and, for some, still are — the competitive areas of the sports have grown exponentially, with worldwide competitions becoming more frequent.\n\n\"I mean, I think it’s about time,\" American skateboarder Ryan Sheckler said during a news conference hosted by Red Bull in May. \"Skateboarding’s cool, and it’s fun, and everywhere that I travel in the world, you can go find a skateboarding scene that is thriving and learning tricks. It’s a huge community.\"\n\nMany athletes see the Olympics as a massive opportunity to get more eyeballs on their sports, and all the benefits that come with it — from sponsorship dollars and training resources to new facilities or maybe college scholarship opportunities at some point.\n\n\"Coming from Hawaii, we don't have the best skate parks,\" said Reynolds, who grew up in Honolulu and is considered a gold-medal contender in the park skateboarding discipline. \"And I'm really hoping maybe after the Olympics that the city will see that this is something that is a respectable sport, and we will build more skate parks, we will build better parks and places for people who want to skateboard.\"\n\nSports see spike during pandemic\n\nThe debuts of skateboarding and surfing come on the heels of a boom in participation during the pandemic, as team sports gave way to individual sports and remote work gave many people more time to pursue new hobbies.\n\nAccording to ActionWatch, which compiles market data in the skateboarding and surfing industries, there were about 8.87 million skateboarders in the United States in 2020 — a whopping 34% jump from the year before. Surfing participation also spiked by 28% in a single year, to 3.8 million.\n\nCHASING GOLD: Sign up for our Olympic newsletter\n\nActionWatch president Patrik Schmidle said the demographics of the two sports discount the notion that the Olympics could cause them to go \"mainstream.\" Both sports have already seen their participants getting older and more affluent, he said.\n\n\"If you walk up to any surf spot today, the number of Teslas and Land Cruisers and expensive SUVs that you see will tell you that it’s no longer this sort of rebel high-school kids that are the stereotypical surfers,\" Schmidle said.\n\n\"(The Olympics) may just kind of continue that trend, but it won’t start a new trend. The concern that it’s no longer sort of the ‘outsider’ or ‘rebel sport,’ I don’t think that’s been the case for a while.\"\n\nSchmidle also said the pandemic had a greater influence on participation figures in those two sports than the Olympics will have. Historically speaking, he said, Olympic sports typically see a slight uptick in participation on the heels of the Games, but the increase is rarely significant.\n\nNevertheless, there are still those in the surfing, skateboarding and climbing communities who worry about an influx of novice participants — particularly with regards to outdoor rock climbing, where overcrowding can have an impact on the environment.\n\n\"It is exciting. I think it is also nerve-racking,\" U.S. Olympic climber Nathaniel Coleman said at Team USA's media summit. \"I think that as the sport grows, and if it grows fast — faster than its community can teach the newcomers — then it faces a lot of challenges.\"\n\nOthers, like U.S. skateboarder Mariah Duran, don't share those concerns. She likened her sport to a tree. Skateboarding's culture will always be its roots, she explained, and competitions like the Olympics are its branches.\n\n\"If you want to do contests, everything, you can do that,\" she said at the media summit. \"If you just want to cruise around the streets or (a) bowl, whatever. There's really space for anybody. You can take it wherever you want, and I feel like the core of skateboarding will always be there.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/20/the-worst-jobs-in-america/39364439/", "title": "What are the worst jobs in America? These have stress, low pay and ...", "text": "Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAn employee’s job satisfaction largely depends on their particular employer. But in some careers, dangerous tasks, high levels of stress, and public scrutiny are all commonplace and can take a toll on employee satisfaction, no matter who the boss is.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 2018 Jobs Rated Report from CareerCast, a targeted job opportunity website, to determine the worst jobs in America. The report ranks over 200 careers on the overall quality of their work environment, amount of stress, occupational outlook, and income.\n\nMany of the worst jobs in America rank poorly because they have among the least job security in the U.S. labor force. The rise of automation could reduce or completely eliminate certain unskilled professions as well as some of the most dangerous jobs in the country.\n\nThe American dream:Counties where it may already be dead\n\nMore store closings coming:Pier 1 Imports could close up to 145 more stores\n\nOf the 30 worst jobs in America, the median annual wage of 23 is less than $50,000 a year. While people in many parts of the country can live comfortably on this income, some of these professions – like taxi drivers, reporters, broadcasters, and more – are based in major cities, where the cost of living tends to be higher.\n\nWant news from USA TODAY on WhatsApp? Click this link on your mobile device to get started\n\nAll jobs come with at least some kind of stress, like public scrutiny and the pressure to succeed. In the worst jobs, these stresses are often more acute – such as the physical danger firefighters and members of the military face, or the stress of dealing with angry customers of workers in retail and the food service industry.\n\n25. Photographer\n\n• Median annual wages: $34,000\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -5.6%\n\n• Total employment: 49,560\n\nPhotographers earn a median wage of $34,000 per year, slightly below the median wage for all U.S. jobs of $37,690. The average U.S. job is projected to have employment growth of 7% from 2016 to 2026, but photographers employment is projected to decline more than 5% in that same time frame. Thanks to camera-equipped smartphones some aspects of photography are more accessible for nonprofessionals. Other photography jobs could be eliminated as companies choose to hire freelancers rather than keeping salaried photographers on their payrolls.\n\n24. Food server\n\n• Median annual wages: $23,290\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +10.2%\n\n• Total employment: 266,190\n\nFood service is a difficult job, requiring servers to spend hours on their feet and interact with many customers in the space of one shift. Servers also depend on tips from customers, as opposed to earning a standard wage or salary like most other jobs. This is one reason servers have one of the lowest median annual wages at $23,290.\n\n23. Roofer\n\n• Median annual wages: $39,970\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +11.1%\n\n• Total employment: 128,680\n\nRoofers install, repair, and replace roofs. They have a difficult working environment. Unable to work in bad weather, roofers often have to work all day in the summer, contending with heat and the relatively dangerous conditions of working on sloped, elevated surfaces. Despite these conditions, most roofers earn less than $40,000 per year, in part because it is an unskilled occupation that does not require a specific level of education.\n\n22. Welder\n\n• Median annual wages: $41,380\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +5.6%\n\n• Total employment: 389,190\n\nWelding is often a physically demanding job because welders often have to work in awkward positions and lift heavy metal objects. This makes for a challenging – and potentially dangerous – work environment. As U.S. infrastructure continues to age, welding jobs should grow steadily nationwide to repair and rebuild structures like bridges, buildings, and roads.\n\n21. Water transportation worker\n\n• Median annual wages: $54,400\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +7.6%\n\n• Total employment: 79,860\n\nWater transportation workers are in charge of directing and maintaining the ships and boats used to move people and cargo across rivers, lakes, oceans, and other waterways. Piloting a boat of any size requires at least some expertise and experience. Any mistake or mechanical failure can be disastrous and even fatal, making this a stressful career. Most water transportation workers make over $54,000, well above the median income for all American jobs.\n\n20. Brickmason\n\n• Median annual wages: $50,950\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +10.3%\n\n• Total employment: 63,930\n\nBrick masonry is a physically demanding job, as workers have to lift, move, and lay heavy materials – typically outdoors and often during the summer. These workers also face demands to complete projects on time and under budget, adding to the stress of the position. Brick masonry does have several upsides, including the relatively high median annual wage as compared to the median of all jobs and the fact that the growing U.S. population will likely lead to steady job growth in the industry.\n\n19. Automobile mechanic\n\n• Median annual wages: $40,710\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +6.1%\n\n• Total employment: 648,050\n\nThough working as an automobile mechanic requires some postsecondary education, specifically at a trade school, as well as a certification, the median annual pay of mechanics is just slightly higher than that of the average American job. Mechanics often have a difficult job environment as they regularly get into awkward and uncomfortable positions for long stretches to diagnose and fix automotive problems.\n\n18. Buyer\n\n• Median annual wages: $62,750\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -5.6%\n\n• Total employment: 407,410\n\nThough a buyer is a vague job title and buyers work in many different fields, they most commonly work on behalf of grocers and other wholesalers, buying produce for resale at stores. Though buyers are well-compensated, earning a median annual wage of $62,750, the career field is projected to shrink and lose workers by 2026. According to the BLS, \"outsourcing and automation of less complex procurement functions\" will lead to a decline in this job's outlook.\n\n17. Truck driver\n\n• Median annual wages: $43,680\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +5.8%\n\n• Total employment: 1,800,330\n\nThough the projected job growth for truck drivers is only slightly lower than for the average American job, this career could be at risk of disappearing as companies like Tesla continue to develop autonomous driving technology. Driving a truck can be a difficult and stressful job. Drivers are responsible for vehicles that often weigh over 26,000 pounds and often lose sleep to meet strict delivery deadlines.\n\n16. Construction laborer\n\n• Median annual wages: $35,800\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +12.4%\n\n• Total employment: 1,001,470\n\nConstruction workers are employed in one of the fastest growing industries in the country. As the American population continues to grow, more and more laborers will be needed to build the growing demand for offices and homes. Workers in this unskilled position are not well-compensated, typically earning less than the median of most jobs. Construction laborer is one of the most physically demanding jobs in America as well as one of the most dangerous – the job has one of the highest illness and injury rates among all occupations.\n\n15. Dockworker\n\n• Median annual wages: $28,260\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +7.6%\n\n• Total employment: 2,893,180\n\nDockworkers, also known as longshoremen, are some of the least well-compensated workers in the country, with a median annual wage nearly $10,000 less than the typical U.S. job. The job requires hours of strenuous physical labor as workers work to load and unload ship cargo. This type of work, with heavy boxes and pallets, can also be dangerous and lead to injuries.\n\n14. Bus driver\n\n• Median annual wages: $42,080\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +9.0%\n\n• Total employment: 174,110\n\nBad weather, heavy traffic, and unruly passengers are among the many stressors bus drivers face while on the job. Though bus drivers are typically required to obtain a commercial driver's license before they can start working, they are not especially well-compensated. The profession's median annual wage is about $42,000, as compared to the median American annual wage of $37,690\n\n13. Chef\n\n• Median annual wages: $48,460\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +9.6%\n\n• Total employment: 128,600\n\nChefs work a difficult and demanding job. As the head of the kitchen, they oversee all food preparation at restaurants and other establishments. The job can be stressful as chefs must ensure all food is prepared correctly, quickly, and to the customers' specifications. Chefs often work a non-traditional schedule, including late nights, weekends, and holidays. These shifts require chefs to spend hours on their feet.\n\n12. Firefighter\n\n• Median annual wages: $49,620\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +7.2%\n\n• Total employment: 321,570\n\nFighting fires is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs in America. These emergency workers must often face dangerous infernos – either in a manmade structure or in the wild as wildfires are becoming more frequent. Beyond the stress and danger of rushing into life threatening situations, firefighters also have a schedule that can be taxing. They must be on call for shifts that typically last about 24 hours, eating and sleeping at the fire station.\n\n11. Pest control worker\n\n• Median annual wages: $35,610\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +8.2%\n\n• Total employment: 77,300\n\nThere are many unpleasant aspects of being a pest control worker. Beyond dealing with roaches, rats, termites, and more, pest control workers must often bend and crawl their way into tight spaces to search for and eliminate pests. Many of these workers also must use pesticides, which are toxic and can be extremely harmful if not handled properly. Pest control work is one of the lower paid jobs in the country, with a median annual wage of $35,610 – about $2,000 less than the median American job.\n\n10. Painter\n\n• Median annual wages: $38,940\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +5.7%\n\n• Total employment: 228,420\n\nPainting can be a physically demanding job as it requires painters to crouch, reach, and kneel to reach all areas that need to be painted. Some painters who work on bridges or tall buildings may have to be comfortable with working high up in the air. Most painters make less than $40,000 per year.\n\n9. Advertising salesperson\n\n• Median annual wages: $51,740\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -3.6%\n\n• Total employment: 133,110\n\nWhile the average job is projected to grow about 7% from 2016 to 2026, the number of advertising salespeople in the U.S. labor force is projected to decline during that period. Many workers in this profession sell space in print media outlets, like newspapers and magazines. But as these outlets decline in circulation or go out of business, fewer advertising sales agents will be needed. Workers in the industry face significant pressure to meet their sales quotas.\n\n8. Broadcaster\n\n• Median annual wages: $40,080\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -3.2%\n\n• Total employment: 31,580\n\nThe BLS projects there will be 3.2% fewer broadcasters in the U.S. labor force in 2026 than there were in 2016. As ad revenue decreases for radio and television broadcasts, stations will likely not be able to afford to employ as many broadcasters as they once did. Though a bachelor's degree is typically the minimum requirement for this job, the median annual wage is just slightly higher than the U.S. median wage for all jobs of $37,690.\n\n7. Disc jockey\n\n• Median annual wages: $33,220\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -11.6%\n\n• Total employment: 27,780\n\nThough it may seem like a great job, disc jockeys, or DJs, are projected to face one of the most challenging working environments in the future. With the rise of online music streaming and podcasts, listeners have other music options than listening to radio stations. This is partially to blame for the projected 11.6% decline in DJ jobs. Those DJs who have a job are typically not well-compensated as most make less than $34,000 per year.\n\n6. Corrections officer\n\n• Median annual wages: $44,330\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -7.7%\n\n• Total employment: 415,000\n\nAt the end of 2016, the most recent year with available data, there were just over 1.5 million prisoners in the United States, down from the peak of 1.6 million in 2009. This decline in the prison population, as well as budgetary issues, will likely contribute to the expected 7.7% drop in the number of working corrections officers in the United States. Largely as a result of violent inmates, corrections officers have among the highest injury and illness rates of all jobs.\n\n5. Enlisted military personnel\n\n• Median annual wages: N/A\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: N/A\n\n• Total employment: N/A\n\nServing in the U.S. military differs from most jobs on this list as military personnel choose to serve their country. It may therefore seem unfair to list them among the \"worst\" jobs, yet they do face very high stress and one of the most difficult working environments possible – especially those serving in combat zones. Meanwhile, many often earn less than $30,000 a year.\n\n4. Retail salesperson\n\n• Median annual wages: $24,200\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +1.7%\n\n• Total employment: 4,448,120\n\nAs a customer-facing job, retail sales workers have a relatively challenging work environment. The job is also one of the lowest paid jobs in the country, with a median annual income of $24,200 – well below the U.S. median of $37,690. The job market for the position is projected to grow at less than 2% by 2026, well below the growth for the average job. The continued rise of online shopping and the struggles of brick-and-mortar retailers may have an even greater impact than anticipated on the number of retail workers.\n\n3. Newspaper reporter\n\n• Median annual wages: $41,260\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -10.0%\n\n• Total employment: 37,140\n\nThe number of newspaper reporters is projected to drop 10% by 2026 as newspapers lose readers and ad revenue. Reporters often face intense scrutiny from readers, added to the stress of print deadlines. In an increasingly polarized political environment, reporters are often inundated with negative feedback from readers and even some death threats.\n\n2. Logger\n\n• Median annual wages: $40,650\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: -12.6%\n\n• Total employment: 37,400\n\nLogging ranks as the second worst job in America, in large part because it also ranks as the second most dangerous job. There were 55 fatal injuries and 350 nonfatal injuries among loggers in 2017. Since it is such a dangerous job, many companies are looking into automating the process of felling trees by hand. This may explain the projected 12.6% decrease in logging jobs by 2026. Even when done safely, logging is very physically strenuous and does not pay especially high wages.\n\n1. Taxi driver\n\n• Median annual wages: $25,980\n\n• Projected job growth, 2016-2026: +5.0%\n\n• Total employment: 207,920\n\nThe combination of low pay, slow employment growth, high stress, and an undesirable work environment has made taxi driving the worst job in America. Taxi drivers work all hours of the day, sometimes in inclement weather, dealing with traffic jams and potentially unruly or rude passengers. Most taxi drivers earn less than $26,000 per year, as compared to the median American annual wage of $37,690. Though the number of taxi drivers is projected to increase by about 5% by 2026, this growth may be curtailed by the rise of ride hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the worst jobs in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 2018 Jobs Rated Report from jobs website CareerCast. We supplemented the CareerCast ranking with data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data on median annual wages for may 2018 and total employment came from the BLS Occupational Employment Statistics program. Projected job growth rates from 2016-2026 also came from the BLS.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

If you’re aiming to completely replace your cable channels or to have every episode of every show at your fingertips, you likely won’t end up with significant savings.\n\nKnow your price\n\nRegardless of whether consumers have bundled internet and television service or not, they spend on average about $103 per month on pay TV, according to Leichtman Research Group. So there are surely savings to be had if you’re willing to make some sacrifices.\n\nYou can often save money by trimming your cable package or cutting the cord completely. You’ll likely find cheaper cable prices advertised, but keep in mind these don’t include extra taxes, fees and equipment rentals, which can bloat your monthly bill.\n\nIf you have a bundle package, with TV and internet or home phone service, you may end up paying relatively more for the internet-only portion when you remove cable, especially if you’re still paying the promotional bundle price.\n\nIf you‘re getting rid of cable altogether, shop around to make sure you get a good deal on your internet-only service and that you purchase enough bandwidth for everyone in your household to stream their shows.\n\nYou could be saving up to $50 per month on your bills. See how much you could save.\n\nNerdWallet can help you lower your bills and find you more ways to save money.\n\nKnow your usage\n\nTime for more strategizing. Just like when shopping for a cable package, think about your must-haves. How highly do you value watching live sports or catching the latest episodes of your shows right when they air? There are myriad on-demand streaming services, but they usually lack access to live TV and up-to-date episodes.\n\nLIVE TV OPTIONS\n\nIf live cable channels are a must, you’ll want to prioritize services like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now. These options are generally more expensive than other streaming services but can still come out to much less than the average cable bill.\n\nThe basic Sling TV package of around 30 channels is $20 per month. PlayStation Vue starts at $49.99 for around 45 channels (although as of this writing it has a promotional price of $39.99). DirecTV Now’s smallest package runs $35 a month for about 60 channels. These packages include channels like ESPN, AMC, HGTV and Cartoon Network – but obviously you won’t get everything in every package.\n\nLeast affordable housing markets:California home to 17 of them\n\nThese are all newer services, so there might by some content delivery hiccups to work out. However, they all promise no hidden fees on top of the advertised price and easy cancellation, in contrast to many people’s experiences with cable.\n\nAnd don’t forget, you can still receive your local broadcast channels live in high definition with a digital antenna. You might be able to get away with broadcast TV for the bigger events you want to watch live and cheaper streaming services to round out your options.\n\nBASIC STREAMING SERVICES\n\nThose cheaper services – like Netflix ($7.99 per month), Hulu ($7.99 per month) and Amazon Prime Video ($8.99 per month) – don’t have live channels, but they do have large libraries of TV episodes, feature films and documentaries on demand. You’ll want to look into what each one has to offer and, again, prioritize your subscriptions rather than signing up for everything.\n\nHBO\n\nIf you can’t live without Netflix’s original series, there’s an easy answer. But if you need to catch every episode of “Game of Thrones” the night it airs, you might have a more difficult decision. HBO Now lets you watch episodes immediately when they air, but it’s $14.99 per month. It has a (relatively smaller) library of other movies, HBO shows and stand-up comedy specials, but if you’re not interested in those, then $15 per month might not be worth it.\n\nFor now, companies like Netflix and HBO are relaxed about paying subscribers sharing their login information with other people, though there may be limits on how many screens you can watch simultaneously.\n\nOne scenario\n\nLet’s look at a hypothetical situation. A Spectrum promotion offers around 175 channels and 60 Mbps internet for $110 per month. The internet service alone costs $45 per month. Note that these promotional prices are only for a certain period and don’t include taxes or fees. (You might even be able to find cheaper internet-only service if you don’t need that much speed.)\n\nWhat are the richest towns in America? Here's the top 34\n\nSay you cut the cable TV part of Spectrum’s service and sign up for something like the basic DirecTV Now package ($35 per month), recovering 60 of those channels, plus Netflix ($7.99 per month) for access to extra movies and shows.\n\nNow you’d be paying approximately $88 per month, not including taxes or fees. You’d have access to live TV and a good amount of on-demand content. You might miss those extra channels, but you’d be saving $264 a year.\n\nKnow the trade-offs\n\nRemember, you’ll likely need to downsize your entertainment options to save money. Also keep in mind what else you’re getting with subscription streaming: on-demand entertainment and no extra cable charges. You watch when you want and won’t have to worry about the price inflating when your promotion expires.\n\nCutting the cord might not work out for everyone at the moment. Streaming video over the internet is quickly becoming the norm, but for now 82% of households still pay for TV through cable or satellite. There’s good reason for it: Streaming services have yet to completely replace traditional pay TV at a reasonable price. Until they do, you’ll have to live with the expensive cable bill or reduced entertainment options.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}]}

Here's how companies are coping ...", "text": "Early in the pandemic , when eateries were forced to shut their doors , delivery became a lifeline. Restaurant operators scrambled to set up delivery channels from scratch or promote ones that previously existed.\n\nBut there was a reason that many restaurants hadn't focused on delivery before the pandemic: Delivery is a pain . It's expensive, since restaurants have to hire drivers or outsource to third-party providers likeor, which charge a fee that cuts into their already razor-thin margins. It's also stressful for employees , who must balance taking care of in-store customers while filling increasing numbers of to-go orders. And when deliveries go wrong, the restaurants take the blame, whether or not it's their fault.\n\nCustomers, on the other hand, don't see it that way. Delivery is convenient. It's usually pretty fast, and perhaps best of all, they can do it through an app — without ever having to talk to a person.\n\nAlthough dine-in restrictions in most places have eased, delivery rates remain higher now than they were pre-Covid. In 2019, delivery accounted for about 7% of total US restaurant sales, according to Euromonitor International. After a spike in 2020, it settled at nearly 9% in 2021, according to Euromonitor's forecast for last year (The company's 2021 foodservice data has not been published.)\n\nSo whether restaurant owners like it or not, delivery is here to stay.\n\n\"Consumers have become accustomed to getting products delivered to their homes,\" said Joe Pawlak, managing principal at Technomic, a food service consulting company. Now, restaurants \"have to figure out what to do to make it profitable.\"\n\nFor restaurants, fixing delivery means not only making it work better, but also finding ways to convince customers to choose carryout or drive-thru instead.\n\nThe problem with delivery\n\nDuring the pandemic, restaurants had to shift to a delivery or takeout model to survive, said Tom Bailey, senior consumer foods analyst at Rabobank.\n\n\"They didn't necessarily do the most efficient adjustment,\" Bailey noted.\n\nJUST WATCHED ChowNow CEO weighs in on the future of food delivery, potential IPO Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH ChowNow CEO weighs in on the future of food delivery, potential IPO 04:34\n\nFor some restaurants, the economics of delivery simply don't add up. Third-party providers charge fees which can be as high as 30%. Restaurants, particularly independent ones, already have thin margins. For some, delivery fees can mean operating in the red.\n\nCertain measures have been put in place to help make delivery less expensive for restaurants. Cities have been capping fees at lower rates . Third-party providers have also started offering lower rates for limited services, allowing restaurants to opt into more affordable, if less extensive, services. Some restaurants are able to negotiate lower rates directly. Others pass costs onto consumers.\n\nStarbucks SBUX Another problem with outsourcing delivery is that when circumstances outside of a restaurant's control go wrong, their own costs can spike.CEO Kevin Johnson walked analysts through a recent scenario that increased costs for the coffee chain during a February call.\n\n\"Our third-party delivery providers had Omicron-related staffing shortages, impacting their ability to fulfill a portion of our distribution needs,\" he said. \"This required us to greatly increase the use of much more expensive ... alternative delivery solutions in order to meet strong customer demand,\" he added. Ultimately, the disruptions meant \"a rapid increase\" in costs.\n\nVirtual brands\n\nCheeto-flavored wings are on the menu at Cosmic Wings.\n\nOne way to tackle the delivery challenge is to separate the service from regular restaurant operations, and use it mainly to attract new customers. That's especially important for casual dining brands such as Applebee's and Chili's, which are designed to serve diners primarily in their restaurants.\n\nThe pandemic prompted these chains and others to set up online-only concepts designed specifically for delivery.\n\nBrinker International EAT Applebee's launched Cosmic Wings , which serves Cheeto-flavored chicken wings., owner of Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy, has two virtual brands so far: It's Just Wings and Maggiano's Italian Classics.\n\nOnline-only brands allow restaurants to promote products that travel well for delivery, such as sandwiches and wings, helping turn the service from a burden into an competitive advantage.\n\nThose virtual brands \"offer some really unique opportunities to explore ... urban and smaller take-out delivery-centric prototypes,\" said Wyman Roberts, Brinker's CEO, during a February analyst call.\n\nFor fast casual and fast food restaurants, which were already designed to get people out the door quickly, better drive-thrus and incentives for carry-out may be the way to go.\n\nBetter drive-thrus and easier pick up\n\nRestaurants like Burger King are investing in drive-thrus.\n\nAs customer habits change, restaurants are rethinking their layouts. For many, that means more drive-thrus.\n\nChains from Taco Bell to Burger King are adding drive-thru lanes to restaurants. More lanes can help speed pick ups — and faster drive-thrus could ultimately be a more attractive option to consumers than delivery.\n\nChipotle CMG , for example, is planning to open about 4,000 more locations in North America. Most of them will have Chipotlanes, a dedicated drive-thru for customers who place orders digitally.\n\n\"What we've seen with the Chipotlane [is], our digital business goes up, our delivery business goes down as a percentage and the order pickup percentage goes up,\" the company's CEO Brian Niccol told CNN Business in a recent interview ahead of the opening of the chain's 3,000th location. \"From an economic standpoint, the best margin transaction for us is in order ahead, and then the customer comes in,\" he said.\n\nIf chains can't convince customers to use speedier drive-thrus, they might try something else, like a small bonus for skipping delivery.\n\nDomino's DPZ Late last month,offered a deal: Pick up your own pizza, the company said, and get a $3 credit toward your next order . Earlier this year, the chain also vowed to deliver a pizza to customers in under two minutes — but only if those customers drove themselves to a Domino's location and parked in the right spot.\n\nIf all else fails, companies may see delivery fall off naturally as the service becomes pricier.\n\nHigher prices\n\nTo make delivery more profitable, companies have been making it more expensive.\n\nAt many restaurants, \"menu prices are higher for delivery than they are .. when somebody goes to the restaurant,\" said Pawlak.\n\nChipotle CMG That's certainly the case at. \"The reality is that channel comes with additional cost,\" Niccol said during a recent analyst call. \"What we've seen is people recognize that and are willing to accept that for those occasions.\"\n\nCompanies have been raising prices on everything from menu items to consumer goods and are saying that so far, customers are sticking around. But that won't last forever.\n\nCoca-Cola KO \"It's easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up,\" Coca-Cola's CEO James Quincey said during a recent analyst call . \"It's much harder when there's a real squeeze on income.\"raised prices last year, and may do so again this year if needed.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/09/12/50-most-popular-restaurants-that-wont-reopen-after-the-pandemic/113707568/", "title": "Coronavirus effect: Popular restaurants that won't open post-pandemic", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nNo segment of the pandemic-battered food service industry seems immune to the financial devastation that has resulted in thousands upon thousands of restaurants nationwide closing their doors permanently.\n\nWhile a small number of fast food chains, especially those with drive-thru windows and menu items well-suited for delivery, have actually increased sales in recent months – KFC, Pizza Hut, and Wingstop among them – many others have experienced substantial downturns. Reduced sales have plagued even popular standbys like Wendy's, Chipotle, and Dunkin', according to a report by Nation’s Restaurant News on major restaurant company performance over the first half of this year.\n\nFull-service chains are hurting, too. The restaurant business data resource Black Box Intelligence reports that 12% of sit-down restaurant chain units that were open before the COVID-19 pandemic are now closed. Such once-thriving chains as California Pizza Kitchen and Chuck E. Cheese have even filed for bankruptcy.\n\nJ.C. Penney acquisition:Mall owners Simon and Brookfield to acquire J.C.

How will business be impacted, for instance, at these 21 restaurant and supermarket chains that require customers to wear masks?\n\nThe situation is just as bad, if not worse, for independent restaurants – whether modest neighborhood establishments, family favorites with decades of history, or flashy newer places opened by celebrity chefs. In the latter category, such culinary luminaries as Wolfgang Puck, David Chang, Daniel Boulud, José Andrés, and Thomas Keller have all been forced by economic circumstance to shutter restaurants in recent months.\n\nAn organization of independent restaurateurs called the Independent Restaurant Coalition has estimated that as many as 85% of the individual restaurants and small restaurant groups around the country might close permanently by the end of 2020. With this in mind, the Coalition is now lobbying Congress to pass a $120 billion bailout bill to help save at least some of the threatened places – an important initiative given that restaurants are definitely among the American brands that might not survive the coronavirus.\n\nBeginning in early May, when it became apparent that government-mandated shutdowns were going to last longer than initially anticipated, 24/7 Tempo has begun tracking permanent restaurant closings around the country. Many thousands of places, chains and independents, have now announced that they will not be reopening even after the pandemic subsides. Iconic establishments in New York state and California – the former particularly hard hit earlier this year, the latter a more recent virus hotspots – have proven particularly vulnerable.\n\nWhile the demise of any restaurant is unfortunate, of course – for its owners, investors, staff, and customers alike – some closings resonate more than others. It's safe to say that the more popular a restaurant was, the more its disappearance will be felt. This list, covering permanently closed establishments in some 17 states and the District of Columbia, focuses on those of particular fame and/or value to their community. All will be greatly missed.\n\nCalifornia: Bäco Mercat\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nIn what Time Out described as \"a shocking turn,\" noted Los Angeles chef-restaurateur Josef Centeno – whose other establishments, Orsa and Winston, has a Michelin star – closed Bäco Mercat early in Aug. Known for its flatbread sandwiches, fried chicken, and seasonal small plates, the establishment is credited with having kicked off the lively downtown L.A. dining scene when it opened in 2011. \"I'm not one for dwelling too much on anything,\" wrote Centeno philosophically in a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page when he announced its closing. \"I know that there is always a beginning, a middle and an end.\"\n\nCalifornia: Ton Kiang\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\n\"Thank you for your years of support,\" read a hand-written sign sitting on a table at this 42-year-old Richmond district dim sum parlor. \"We will be closed for good on Aug. 30, Sunday at 7:30 PM.\" Neither the sign nor a longer statement posted in the window of the place specifically cited COVID-19 as the reason for closing, but weekend business had declined, and the restaurant found it difficult to hire and keep staff, according to Eater.\n\nCalifornia: Din Tai Fung\n\n• Location: Arcadia\n\nThis highly acclaimed international dumpling and noodle house chain, founded in Taiwan in 1972, opened this, its first North American location, in 2000. Now it's gone. A post on the restaurant's Instagram page reads, \"As a result of the current economic climate, we have made the difficult decision to permanently close...\" Southern Californians will still be able to enjoy Din Tai Fung's famous xiao long bao – better known as soup dumplings – and other specialties at the chain's Century City and Santa Anita locations.\n\nCalifornia: Broken Spanish\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nDescribed by Eater Los Angeles as \"powerful\" and \"genre-bending,\" this five-year-old contemporary Mexican restaurant depended heavily for business on the downtown nexus of sports, convention, and concert venues – all now closed because of the pandemic. Owner-chef Ray Garcia announced the restaurant's demise in early August on Instagram. He does plan, however, on launching a delivery-only taco outlet called Mila.\n\nCalifornia: The Bazaar by José Andrés and Somni\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nHigh-profile chef-restaurateur and humanitarian José Andrés announced in early August that he was shuttering his Spanish-inspired dining room The Bazaar in the SLS Beverly Hills hotel. Though the closing comes amidst legal actions between the chef's ThinkFoodGroup and the hotel owners that aren't directly related to the pandemic, the group's statement on the closure blames the hotel company for \"alleging defaults that were obviously incapable of being cured while our employees lived through shelter-in-place orders.\" Also closed is Somni, the 10-seat avant-garde tasting-menu counter operation, nestled behind The Bazaar – one of the few L.A. restaurants with two Michelin stars.\n\nCalifornia: Dong Il Jang\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is home to the world's largest Korean community outside Korea itself, and its ever-growing Koreatown neighborhood has long been famous for its many restaurants, serving both traditional and modern Korean fare. Dong Il Jang was one of the oldest of these, launched 41 years ago. In announcing on Instagram that this year was their last, the owners wrote, \"Over the four decades we have been through many difficult situations but the Covid-19 pandemic has made it very difficult for us to survive ...\"\n\nCalifornia: Patina\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nGerman-born, French-trained chef Joachim Splichal opened the original Patina in Hollywood in 1989, moving it downtown to the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Center in 2003. Patina eventually spawned an empire of more than 50 other restaurants in five states and Japan, and while Splichal no longer owns the Patina Restaurant Group, the original had remained his flagship. Though no official announcement of its closing has been made, employees recently received letters of termination, effective Aug. 15, and the restaurant no longer appears on the group website.\n\nCalifornia: Trois Mec\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the proprietors of this hole-in-the-wall tasting-menu restaurant – French chef Ludo Lefebvre and his American colleagues Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo (of the popular Animal and Son of a Gun) – \"are surely among the most influential restaurateurs\" in L.A. Unfortunately, neither their prominence nor their Michelin star helped them survive the pandemic. \"Covid-19 has changed everything,\" Lefebvre wrote on his Instagram page, adding, \"I had to accept the reality that it was time to let the idea of reopening Trois Mec go.\"\n\nCalifornia: Español Italian\n\n• Location: Sacramento\n\nEspañol Italian Restaurant – the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the state capital, opened in 1923 – has announced that it has permanently ceased operations. Originally, the dining room at the Hotel Español, or Spanish Hotel, was known for Basque food. When the Luigi family bought it in 1959, they switched to Italian fare, moving the place to its current location in 1965. Looking at the books in early July, co-owner Perry Luigi told Valley Community Newspapers, he \"kind of made the decision that we can't stay open another month or everything will be gone.\"\n\nCalifornia: Biba Restaurant\n\n• Location: Sacramento\n\nBologna-born Biba Caggiano ramped up the restaurant scene in the California capital when she opened this place 33 years ago. Caggiano, who went on to become a successful cookbook author and TV food personality, died last August, and her family was already reportedly having difficulty running the restaurant before the crisis. A statement signed by Caggiano's husband and daughters on the Biba website announced \"Our last day was Friday, May 8th, 2020,\" explaining that \"Our beloved restaurant community has been shuttered and with the uncertainty of what the future holds, we are unable to wait out this storm.\"\n\nCalifornia: Hakkasan\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\nAn upscale 170-seat Chinese restaurant, which cost a reported $7 million to build, Hakkasan closed permanently in late May after eight years of serving black cod with Champagne and honey, black truffle duck, and other luxurious specialties. The decision was made \"To preserve the long-term stability of our business,\" according to a company statement given to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThere are 11 other outposts of the chain – three more in the U.S., two in London, and one each in five other cities in Asia and the Middle East. The Hakkasan in Shanghai, the chain's only operation in China itself, has also closed in response to the coronavirus's effects on business.\n\nCalifornia: Louis'\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\nA San Francisco restaurant icon that opened in 1937 above the remains of the historic 1894-vintage public swimming complex called Sutro Baths, Louis's is no more. The owners – grandchildren of the original owners – posted a message on the restaurant Facebook page in mid-July reading in part \"After much deliberation and a lot of tears we have decided after 83 continuous years of business...to close our business permanently.\"\n\nCalifornia: Pacific Dining Car\n\n• Location: Santa Monica\n\nThe original Pacific Dining Car in downtown L.A., founded in 1921 and probably the city's best-known steakhouse, spawned this Westside location in 1990. Serving 24 hours a day until the coronavirus lockdown, it was considered a Santa Monica essential. The owners say that the combination of the pandemic crisis and curfews imposed during the recent protests made it untenable for the restaurant to reopen.\n\nThe contents of the place – including kitchen equipment, table settings, furniture, and paintings – were sold at auction in June.\n\nColorado: 20th Street Café\n\n• Location: Denver\n\nAfter 74 years in business under three generations of the Okuno family, this neighborhood breakfast-and-lunch establishment has called it quits. The place has survived \"up-turns and crazy downturns in the economy,\" wrote current owners Rod and Karen Okuno on the restaurant website, \"but this final one proved to be insurmountable for our little corner of the world.\"\n\nFlorida: Elize\n\n• Location: Orlando\n\nAug. 22 was the last night for this well-reviewed offshoot of a restaurant with the same name in Utrecht, in The Netherlands. Elize chef Leon Mazairac – said to be a culinary celebrity in Holland – was hailed in March by Orlando Weekly as \"one of the city's best new chefs.\" His menu of modern European small plates, however, was no match for COVID-19. \"[T]he large economic impact resulting from the coronavirus pandemic has made it impossible for us to sustain operations,\" wrote the restaurant's owners on the Elize Facebook page.\n\nFlorida: Le Sirenuse Restaurant & Champagne Bar\n\n• Location: Miami\n\nOne of two luxury restaurants in the 1930s-vintage Four Seasons Surf Club hotel – the other being the Surf Club Restaurant, run by famed chef Thomas Keller – Le Sirenuse is now permanently closed. \"The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the South Florida community [...] have required us to make this difficult decision,\" reads a statement on the three-year-old restaurant's website. The original Le Sirenuse on Italy's Amalfi Coast remains open, as does Keller's restaurant – though his similarly themed TAK Room in Manhattan (see below) is another COVID-19 casualty.\n\nFlorida: La Tropicana\n\n• Location: Tampa\n\nPresidents George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, along with several Florida governors, were among the many customers of this 1963-vintage Cuban cafÃ© over the years. A focus of public life in Tampa's historic Ybor City neighborhood, La Tropicana also served a wide range of less famous customers. In explaining why the place was closing down, proprietor Gio PeÃ±a told the Tampa Bay Times, \"I'd say 80 percent of my regular customers are older people. They are afraid to come out.\" He added \"We were doing good. Business was steady. And then came COVID.\"\n\nGeorgia: Anne and Bill's\n\n• Location: Forest Park\n\nAfter 46 years in business in this Atlanta suburb, Anne and Bill's – known for its meat-and-three menu (various meats served with a variety of side dishes), its breakfasts, and its homemade desserts – is going out of business. A statement from the restaurant in mid-May said that \"our sales have dropped so low that we cannot continue to operate....\" A second location, in McDonough, southeast of Forest Park, has also closed.\n\nIllinois: Blackbird\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nThis well-loved West Loop restaurant – hailed by the Chicago Tribune as \"one of Chicago's greatest restaurants\" – was opened 22 years ago by Paul Kahan, who has since become one of the city's best-known chef-restaurateurs. (His other places include Avec, Publican, and Big Star). Blackbird's intimate size and layout made social distancing impossible, and the restaurant announced on its website that \"we have made the very difficult decision to close our doors.\"\n\nIllinois: Katana\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nAn offshoot of an upscale Los Angeles-based Japanese restaurant with a celebrity clientele opened in Chicago three years ago, specializing in creative sushi offerings and top-of-the-line wagyu beef cooked on charcoal imported from Japan. The group that owns Katana announced in mid-May that it would not be reopening. A location in Dubai has also closed.\n\nLouisiana: DTB\n\n• Location: New Orleans\n\nThis popular \"Cajun coastal\" restaurant, which opened in March 2017, survived the death of its co-owner and original chef Carl Schaubhut last year. It reopened this July after shutting down in mid-March with the arrival of the pandemic. The reopening proved to be a brief one. \"[I]t was the prospect of an uncertain future and an unknown timeline to return to some semblance of normalcy that prompted ownership to make this very tough decision to close,\" the restaurant's proprietors said in a statement published by Eater.\n\nLouisiana: K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen\n\n• Location: New Orleans\n\nThe demise of the legendary K-Paul's in mid-July is one of the most significant of all COVID-related restaurant closures. This highly influential Cajun establishment was opened in 1979 by chef Paul Prudhomme and his wife, Kay, and it soon became a Crescent City bucket-list destination, with lines forming nightly outside. With such vividly flavored dishes as the iconic blackened redfish, K-Paul's ignited a nationwide craze for Cajun cooking. Kay died of cancer in 1993 and Prudhomme passed away in 2015, but the place stayed open under the chef's niece, Brenda Prudhomme, and her chef husband, Paul Miller.\n\nAfter several coronavirus-mandated closings and reopenings earlier this year, though, they issued a statement on July 13 \"regretfully announcing permanent closure of K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen.\" Miller explained to NOLA.com that \"The business has been bleeding through this, and you can only bleed so much before you have to stop it.\"\n\nMaine: Vinland\n\n• Location: Portland\n\nFamous for its rigorously local New England-based menu (such staples as olive oil and black pepper were banned from the kitchen on the grounds they're not produced in the Northeast), Vinland served its final meal on Aug. 21. Chef-owner David Levi posted a message on Facebook reading in part, \"Vinland could not withstand the long quarantine required for the Covid-19 pandemic, the disproportionate impact on the fine dining sector of the food industry, and the overall downturn in the economy, the last of which may reverberate for years.\" He added, \"I’d hoped for a reopening even as I failed to see the viable path. The path, for us, didn’t exist. \"\n\nMassachusetts: Legal Test Kitchen\n\n• Location: Boston\n\nA branch of the famed Massachusetts fish and shellfish chain Legal Seafoods, this once-bustling 15-year-old establishment in Boston's Seaport district is now out of business, according to information reported on Aug. 27. \"Due to the lack of area business and travel ... \"the company felt it didn't make sense to reopen the location,\" Legal explained to Boston.com. There is one other Test Kitchen location at the city's Logan Airport (the idea was that the Test Kitchens would experiment on dishes not found on the chain's usual menus). It is currently closed but will reopen in early fall. Meanwhile, 11 other Legal Seafood locations around the state remain open.\n\nMassachusetts: Caffe Bella\n\n• Location: Randolph\n\nAfter almost three decades of serving Italian fare in this community south of Boston, Caffe Bella closed down in March like other area restaurants for what owner Patrick Barnes Jr. hoped would be a temporary hiatus. Unlike other local establishments, though, it didn't reopen when restrictions were eased. It never will. In late July, Barnes posted a statement on Facebook saying that \"[U]nfortunately the pandemic has caused the Caffe to call it a day!\"\n\nMassachusetts: Craigie Burger\n\n• Location: Boston\n\nThough it specializes in tasting menus of imaginative modern American fare, chef Tony Maws' Craigie on Main in Cambridge became most famous for its epic burger, only 18 of which were prepared each evening. Last year, Maws capitalized on its fame by opening Craigie Burger in the new Time Out Market Boston in Fenway. The temporarily closed Craigie Burger won't reopen, according to Maws and his partners. They feel that the lack of Red Sox games at Fenway Park and the absence of students from several nearby colleges would make reviving the enterprise too chancy.\n\nMaws told the Boston Globe that the concept will eventually make a comeback, and that the burger is still available on Craigie on Main's takeout menu.\n\nMichigan: Markovski's Family Restaurant\n\n• Location: Dearborn Heights\n\nAfter 50 years in business in this suburb of Detroit, Markovski's, famous for its stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, and other Polish specialties, has said goodbye. In a statement on Facebook, the proprietors declared that \"A worldwide pandemic was the only thing that could separate our tightly knit family [and] if you were here, you were definitely family.\"\n\nMinnesota: Octo Fishbar\n\n• Location: Minneapolis\n\nChef Tim McKee, winner of a James Beard Award as Best Chef Midwest, opened this place in 2017 in a two-level space in the Market House Collaborative, a small food hall in which customers could pick out their own seafood for the restaurant to cook and serve. It got good reviews and offered takeout meals after it had to close down in March, with indoor dining resuming in June. However, McKee made the decision to shut down the restaurant permanently at the end of July. \"The impacts surrounding COVID promed to be just too much,\" managing partner Loren Zinter told the Star Tribune.\n\nMinnesota: Fuji Ya\n\n• Location: Minneapolis\n\nWhen Reiko Weston opened Fuji Ya in 1959, it was apparently the first-ever Japanese restaurant in Minnesota. It expanded and spawned offshoots. Weston died in 1988, and two years later the place closed down – until her daughter brought it back to life in 1997. The restaurant shuttered temporarily in early May, but by the end of that month, its website carried the message: \"Thank you for your support! Unfortunately we are closing our doors.\"\n\nMissouri: Cusanelli's Restaurant\n\n• Location: St. Louis\n\nOccupying a building that traces its history back two centuries, this institution in the city's Lemay neighborhood – featuring what it billed as \"The Original St. Louis Style Pizza\" – opened in 1954. It became a family favorite, and comments on the restaurant's Facebook page sentimentally recall first dates, birthdays, anniversaries, and other momentous occasions celebrated there. It was also on Facebook that the owners announced that Aug. 30 would be the restaurant's last night of service, \"Due to covid and unforeseen circumstances ...\"\n\nNew York: Maison Premiere\n\n• Location: Brooklyn\n\nThis popular nine-year-old Williamsburg restaurant, known for its oysters, its New Orleans-style dishes, and its James Beard Award-winning bar program, is apparently out of business. Though it has issued no official statement, its website and Instagram page have shut down, its Facebook page continues no posts, and its phone number is not in service. Maison Premier's sister restaurant, Sauvage, also in Brooklyn, is apparently similarly closed. Both restaurants filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a year ago but had continued operating until they were closed, theoretically temporarily, with the advent of the pandemic.\n\nNew York: Augustine\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nBlaming the inflexibility of his landlord, celebrated restaurateur Keith McNally announced on Instagram in late July that his French brasserie in downtown Manhattan's Beekman Hotel, opened in 2016, is now out of business. McNally, who himself was hospitalized for COVID-19 in April but is now fully recovered, had earlier closed his 31-year-old SoHo bistro Lucky Strike due to the pandemic. On Instagram, McNally wrote that he looked forward to seeing his customers at one of his other New York City establishments – which include Balthazar, Pastis, and Minetta Tavern – \"Or Debtor's Prison - whichever comes first.\"\n\nNew York: TAK Room\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nJoining the ranks of other celebrity chefs who've been forced to permanently close restaurants around the nation – including the likes of Wolfgang Puck, José Andrés, Daniel Boulud, and David Chang – Thomas Keller has announced the demise of his TAK Room in the massive Hudson Yards development. The decision to close the super-pricey TAK Room as well as Keller's more modest Bouchon Bakery in the same complex came, according to a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page, \"after painful deliberations amid a pandemic that has devastated the global economy and caused irreparable damage to our business and profession.\"\n\nNew York: Uncle Boons\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nTwo former chefs at Thomas Keller's acclaimed Per Se, Ann Redding and Matt Danzer, opened this small but very popular (and eventually Michelin-starred) Thai restaurant in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood in 2013. Now, a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page says, \"We've made the very difficult decision not to reopen Uncle Boon on the other side of the pandemic.\" Eater called Redding and Danzer \"some of the most exciting restaurateurs in NYC\" on the basis of this place and their subsequently opened restaurants Uncle Boons Sister (which remains open for delivery and takeout) and Thai Diner (which will continue to deliver some favored Uncle Boons menu items).\n\nNew York: Aquagrill\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nAdd this 24-year-old SoHo seafood restaurant to the list of establishments that had closed temporarily in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has now decided to make the closure permanent. \"Aquagrill is not continuing to operate in light of the unsafe effects of the coronavirus on public dining out,\" reads a statement on the restaurant website.\n\nNew York: Gotham Bar & Grill\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nOne of the most famous and long-lived restaurants to shut down permanently in the face of the pandemic, Gotham weathered the departure last year of chef Alfred Portale, who had been in charge of the kitchen for 34 years (he started in 1985, a year after the restaurant opened). The new chef, Victoria Blamey, received promising reviews. Then came the pandemic.\n\nIn announcing the decision to close in mid-March, Gotham issued a statement explaining that \"the unforeseen situation created by the coronavirus has made operation of the restaurant untenable.\"\n\nNew York: Jewel Bako\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nA sign in the window of this well-loved Michelin-starred sushi bar near Manhattan's Cooper Square, posted in mid-May, announced an \"open house sale\" of kitchen goods, appliances, and equipment, as well as wine \"for cheap.\" In 2018, Jewel Bako's owners opened a chef's counter place next door called Restaurant Ukiyo, which also won a Michelin star. A statement on the Ukiyo website announced officially that both establishments have closed for good.\n\nNew York: Toro\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nNoted Boston chef-restaurateurs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette have permanently closed the once-bustling Manhattan location of this tapas restaurant, opened in 2013. The original Boston restaurant and a location in Dubai remain in business. \"Toro NYC has come to the end of our journey,\" reads a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page, \"and the staff will not have a restaurant home to come back to when this pandemic ends.\"\n\nOregon: Pok Pok restaurants\n\n• Location: Portland\n\nJames Beard Award-winning chef-restaurateur Andy Ricker, whose Pok Pok restaurant group specializes in northern Thai and Vietnamese cooking, announced on Instagram in mid-June that he was closing four of his six Portland locations. It was originally reported that the shuttered restaurants would include Pok Pok NW, Whiskey Soda Lounge, and two outposts of Pok Pok Wing. The original Pok Pok would reopen, it was said, and a third Pok Pok Wing might also come back to life. Currently, however, the Pok Pok website states that \"All Pok Pok restaurant locations are closed for on site service,\" adding that meal kits and some prepared food is available for pickup at the company's commissary kitchen.\n\nPennsylvania: Ritz Barbecue\n\n• Location: Allentown\n\nDescribed by the Morning Call as \"An Allentown landmark restaurant where generations of families gathered for barbecue, banana splits, milkshakes and more,\" the Ritz grew out of a fairgrounds stand established in 1927 and moved to its present site 10 years later. The current owners, Jeff and Grace Stinner, who took over in 1981, announced in mid-June that they would not reopen. Though the restaurant had been for sale since 2019, Grace stressed to the Morning Call that the pandemic is to blame for their recent decision. \"We did want to stay open until someone else took over,\" she said, \"but that's not feasible now.\n\nSouth Carolina: Jestine's Kitchen\n\n• Location: Charleston\n\nA major tourist draw for 24 years, Jestine's was named for Jestine Matthews, the African American housekeeper and cook employed by the white family that founded the place (Matthews died in 1997 at the age of 112). It was recently criticized as \"the last Charleston restaurant to openly capitalize on the narrative of black servitude,\" in the words of The Post and Courier. After reopening on May 20, the restaurant announced in mid-June that it would cease operations for good due to \"the quick onset of the scary pandemic.\"\n\nSouth Carolina: McCrady's\n\n• Location: Charleston\n\nKnown for the avant-garde tasting menus introduced by noted chef Sean Brock (who departed in 2018), McCrady's will not resume serving even after restrictions are lifted. David Howard, president of Neighborhood Dining Group, which owns the restaurant, issued a statement saying in part that \"we've come to the difficult decision that McCrady's...will no longer be viable in this changed business environmentâ¦.\" The group's Mexican restaurant, Minero, upstairs from McCrady's, has also closed for good, but the Atlanta location has reopened, with restrictions in place, and a new location, on John's Island, just southwest of Charleston, is scheduled to open later this summer.\n\nDunkin' vs. Starbucks:Among America's favorite brew-at-home coffee brands, which comes out ahead?\n\nPandemic effect:Dog days of the pandemic create a thriving economy for man's best friend\n\nTexas: Cafe Texan\n\n• Location: Huntsville\n\nThis iconic 83-year-old establishment north of Houston, said to have been the oldest cafÃ© in Texas still in its original location, is gone for good. Owner John Strickland told The Huntsville Item that he had remained closed for months out of concern for the health of his customers, many of whom were seniors, and his staff. However, he said, \"I had not intended to close it permanently.\" When he realized that that would be necessary, he sold the building, which will apparently be turned into a museum.\n\nTexas: Highland Park Cafeteria\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nKnown for its zucchini muffins, chicken-fried steak, homemade pies, and other comfort food, this community favorite, opened in 1925, will not reopen. Addressing its customers, a statement on the restaurant website said \"We would love to have a farewell event to honor you and our faithful employees, but due to the current restrictions, we won't be able to do so.\" The statement left open the possibility that the place might be revived in the future, adding \"So, making no promises – but who knows? Zucchini Muffins may one day make a comeback!\"\n\nTexas: Threadgill's\n\n• Location: Austin\n\nOpened as a gas station and beer bar in 1933, this Austin institution evolved into a leading music venue, hosting such luminaries as Janis Joplin and Jerry Lee Lewis, and then into a restaurant in 1981 after a new owner bought it. Threadgill's spawned a second location in 1996, but that one closed in 2018, and now the original Threadgill's has closed as well. The premises will be sold at auction on Aug. 8.\n\nWashington: HaNa Sushi\n\n• Location: Seattle\n\nThe longest-running business in Capitol Hill's popular Broadway Alley mall, opened in 1989, HaNa was described on the Vanishing Seattle Facebook page as \"relaxed, homey & down to earth, with a steady stream of regulars & folks who've been coming here for decades.\" They won't be coming any longer. Owner Aung Aung confirmed HaNa's permanent demise to the Capitol Hill Seattle blog, saying \"Now is a very hard time. I don't know about Broadway right now.\"\n\nWashington: Trattoria Cuoco\n\n• Location: Seattle\n\nProlific Seattle restaurateur Tom Douglas temporarily closed 12 of his 13 local establishments in mid-March over coronavirus concerns. Now, he has announced that he won't reopen this one, a popular pasta place located in one of Amazon's buildings in the South Lake Union neighborhood. He will also close his Brave Horse Tavern in the same complex. \"Many factors weighed into the determination,\" he said in a statement, \"but in the end, it is the appropriate choice for our business.\"\n\nWashington, D.C.: America Eats Tavern by José Andrés\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPeripatetic chef-restaurateur and humanitarian José Andrés opened the original America Eats in 2011 as a pop-up on the site of his Café Atlántico to coincide with an American food exhibition called \"What's Cooking, Uncle Sam?\" at the National Archives. It moved from there to the suburb of Tysons Corner, Virginia, and then, two years ago, to Georgetown. In late June, a post on the restaurant's Facebook page announced that \"we will not be reopening in our current home, we look forward to revisiting this concept in the future.\"\n\nWashington, D.C.: The Source\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter 13 years in business, it's curtains for Wolfgang Puck's first restaurant in the nation's capital. (He retains a subsequently launched branch of his CUT steakhouse in the city's Rosewood Hotel). A modern Asian restaurant in the basement of what was once the Newseum – an institution devoted to journalism and the First Amendment that closed at the end of 2019 – The Source is now permanently shuttered.\n\nWisconsin: Schreiner's Restaurant\n\n• Location: Fond du Lac\n\nA popular family dining destination since 1938 in this city on Lake Winnebago in eastern Wisconsin, Schreiner's announced in late May that it was closing its doors.

More than 8 million restaurant employees have been laid off or furloughed around the country. The restaurant industry as a whole is predicted to sustain $240 billion in losses by the end of 2020, according to a National Restaurant Association study of the economic impact of the coronaviruscrisis.\n\nRestaurants in many states are now at least partially open again, usually for outdoor dining only, or else with restrictions on indoor capacity. While waiting for business to resume, many establishments have managed to stay in business by making dine-out options available to their customers. There have even been fancy restaurants offering takeout and delivery during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nNevertheless, many thousands that closed \"temporarily\" when the first lockdown orders were issued have subsequently determined that they simply won't be able to afford to reopen. In California alone, according to the California Restaurant Association, as many as 30,000 eating places might be out of business by the time the crisis abates. Restaurants are often examples of iconic businesses closed because of the coronavirus.\n\n24/7 Tempo has assembled an updated list of 50 of the most popular eating places, in some 26 states and Washington D.C., that will not be reopening. These range from family-style Chinese restaurants to slick steakhouses, from neighborhood pubs to high-profile outposts of the Wolfgang Puck and David Chang empires.\n\nIn addition to the individual restaurants on this list, numerous units of such nationwide chains as P.F. Chang's, Outback Steakhouse, Denny's, Morton's the Steakhouse, Fleming's Prime Steakhouse, Steak 'n Shake, and TGI Fridays have shuttered for good.\n\nSome national or regional chains are closing down entirely, as well, among them Specialty's Café and Bakery, which had 50 restaurants in California, Washington, and Illinois, and Sweet Tomatoes (called Souplantation in Southern California), a 97-location salad, soup, and bakery buffet chain covering several states. Still other notable operations have filed for bankruptcy, with their futures uncertain but at least some restaurant closings probably inevitable. Among these are Le Pain Quotidien and a 49-unit Florida-based IHOP franchisee.\n\nNew casualties are announced almost daily in virtually every state. 24/7 Tempo will periodically update and expand this list as the number of restaurants closing permanently continues to grow.\n\nCheese craze:Why are there international pleas to eat more cheese?

This time, though, it's gone for good, shuttering as of April 30. \"[W]e would be lying if we were to say that COVID-19 is the only reason we are closing,\" according to a statement from the restaurant to Eater, \"but it is definitely the straw that broke the camel's back.\" The location will be taken over for an upscale Mexican restaurant from Geno Bahena, a longtime veteran of Rick Bayless's definitive Chicago Mexican establishments.\n\nIllinois: Luella's Gospel Bird\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nA fried chicken specialist in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood, opened in 2018, Luella's has gone out of business as a result of the pandemic closing. The original location, in Lincoln Square, continues on, doing takeout and delivery, and plans to reopen when the situation stabilizes.\n\nIllinois: Toast\n\n• Locations: Chicago\n\nNeither location of this 24-year-old breakfast-and-brunch favorite – Bucktown and Lincoln Park – will return, even when dining restrictions in the city are lifted. \"There isn't any kind of fund sitting in the bank to cover expenses,\" owner Jeanne Roeser told Chicago's Fox32. Anyway, she added, with occupancy limits, masks, and social distancing, diners wouldn't enjoy the kind of experience the restaurant had long provided.\n\nIndiana: Next Door American Eatery\n\n• Location: Indianapolis\n\nThis casual farm-to-table restaurant has closed indefinitely, though a spokesperson left open the possibility that it could reopen \"once we get through this pandemic.\" Its staff has been permanently let go in the meantime.

Uraiklang had died recently of cancer, but her family promised her they'd keep the place going. The impact of the coronavirus made that impossible, they said.\n\nLouisiana: Satterfield's Upper Deck Restaurant\n\n• Location: New Roads\n\nThis popular steak and seafood restaurant on the banks of False River near Baton Rouge closed on April 30 and it recently announced that it would not be reopening. Satterfield's was established in 1996 in a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, originally home to a 1917-vintage Ford dealership, Satterfield's Motors. The owners note that their Landing Bar, downstairs from the restaurant, will remain open.\n\nMaine: Uncle Andy's Diner\n\n• Location: Portland\n\nUncle Andy's opened in 1954, establishing a strong local reputation for comforting diner classics – including made-to-order pancakes, which current proprietor Dennis Fogg would shape into dinosaurs or flowers to please his younger customers. The diner was struggling even before the virus hit – it was the subject of a makeover on the Food Network show \"Restaurant Impossible\" – but as Fogg explained to the Portland Press-Herald, \"We've always been able to just get by, but now we can't.\"\n\nMaryland: Döner Bistro\n\n• Location: Frederick\n\nA German-inspired Biergarten and grill (whose name references the Turkish sandwich that is popular street food in Germany), this establishment, opened in 2014, announced its permanent demise in mid-April. Another location, in Leesburg, Virginia, will remain open.\n\nMassachusetts: The Table at Season to Taste\n\n• Location: Cambridge\n\n\"Top Chef\" finalist Carl Dooley has announced in early May that the 20-seat prix-fixe restaurant he ran, attached to the Season to Taste catering operation, is permanently out of business. Owner Robert Harris is restructuring his catering arm, launching a take-out and delivery brand called Season to Go, but felt that the restaurant had to go. \"[T]his is the sad and harsh reality I and the teams I employ all had to face,\" he said in a press release.\n\nMassachusetts: Hattapon's Thai Kitchen\n\n• Location: Greenfield\n\nThis 14-year-old Thai favorite in northern Massachusetts won't reopen even when it would be permitted. The owners had already decided to close this spring for economic reasons, but the pandemic hurried things along, and also made it impossible for them to sell food at various local festivals as they had planned.\n\nMinnesota: Vivo Kitchen\n\n• Location: Apple Valley\n\nThis eclectic 400-seat restaurant in a Twin Cities suburb announced that its doors were permanently closed on May 24 in a statement on its Facebook page on May 16. \"We have given our absolute best to innovate and adapt to the ever-changing pandemic world we live in,\" wrote the establishment's executive director, \"[but] the reality is that the business margins...are not maintainable.\n\nMinnesota: The Egg and I Diner\n\n• Location: Minneapolis\n\nThe Egg and I had been serving breakfast dishes daily, for both breakfast and lunch, for more than 30 years.

He still plans to reopen his second location, in St. Paul, when possible.\n\nNew Hampshire: The Joinery Restaurant\n\n• Location: Newmarket\n\nThe proprietor of this 6-year-old farm-to-table restaurant near Portsmouth decided in mid-March not to reopen even when he's allowed to. \"I didn't feel it was prudent to take on more debt\" that might be difficult to pay back, he said.\n\nNew Jersey: Jake's Restaurant & Bar\n\n• Location: Flemington\n\nA staple in Flemington, a Hunterdon County town southwest of Newark, for almost 30 years, Jake's was a combination fine-dining restaurant and sports bar. The owners announced on April 9 that their temporary closing had become permanent.\n\nNew Mexico: The Cooperage\n\n• Location: Albuquerque\n\nOpened in 1976, this prime rib restaurant, also noted for its salad bar, announced at the beginning of April that it had shuttered for good. The loss of wedding and catering business was a contributing factor.\n\nNew York: The Chef & the Cook\n\n• Location: Baldwinsville\n\nThis 2-year-old establishment in the Syracuse metropolitan area became possibly the first restaurant in central New York State to announce that it would not reopen once the coronavirus shut-down ended. The owners decided in late March to pull the plug, noting that their lease was due for renewal soon anyway.\n\nAsk HR:Can my company require temperature checks?\n\nWant to quit over COVID-19?:Some things you need to know\n\nNew York: Coogan's\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThis Irish pub and restaurant in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood – which styled itself \"America's #1 Runners Restaurant\" – closed its doors on March 17 for what was initially going to be a limited period of time. On April 21, however, the owners posted a statement on the Coogan's website saying \"We had hoped to open them again but sadly that is not possible.\"\n\nNew York: Daddy-O\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nA Greenwich Village dive bar and restaurant, Daddy-O was a favorite hangout for New York City chefs until it closed up earlier this month. It had an upstate New York vibe, as expressed by dishes like Buffalo wings and the Rochester specialty the \"garbage plate\" (involving fried potatoes, hot dogs, baked beans, meat sauce, and other ingredients). Owner Phil Casaceli has confirmed the closing but provided no details about the restaurant's demise.\n\nNew York: Lucky Strike\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nOpened in 1989 by noted Manhattan restaurant mogul Keith McNally, this SoHo bistro initially provided takeout and delivery services when in-house dining was banned, like many other places. It stopped doing that in late March, before announcing in April that it would not be reopening. McNally – whose other restaurants include the acclaimed Balthazar and Minetta Tavern – was himself hospitalized in London with COVID-19 in early April.\n\nNew York: Momofuku Nishi\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nDavid Chang, the chef-restaurateur whose Momofuku empire has been a major influence on the American food scene. He opened this establishment in 2016 with an Italian-Korean theme, recasting it with a more purely Italian menu the following year. It never took off like some of his other places, and in mid-May, his company announced on its website that \"returning to normal is not an option,\" so the place won't reopen. Chang also plans to move his popular Ssäm Bar from the East Village to South Street Seaport, where he has another restaurant location.\n\nNew York: The Paris Café\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe logo for this 147-year-old pub and restaurant at South Street Seaport reads \"Since 1873 - Forever.\" That turned out not to be the case. In a message posted on the establishment's Facebook page, proprietor Pete O'Connell wrote \"Through no fault of anyone but the outbreak of this virus we are unable to forge a way forward that makes economic sense. We had no option but to close our doors.\"\n\nOhio: Parkers Blue Ash Tavern\n\n• Location: Cincinnati\n\nA suburban Cincinnati favorite, serving steak and seafood in an upscale environment for almost 40 years, the Tavern has posted a message on its website reading in part \"Due to the uncertainty associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry, and Parkers Blue Ash Tavern in particular, it has been very difficult for us to plan a reopening.\"\n\nOhio: Spice Kitchen & Bar\n\n• Location: Cleveland\n\nCiting cancellations for its catering business as well as declining restaurant revenues, this 8-year-old establishment – named one of Cleveland Magazine's best restaurants of the year in 2019 – announced in mid-March that it was shuttering permanently. The catering company will continue to operate.\n\nOregon: Pacific Way Bakery & Café\n\n• Location: Gearhart\n\nThis 32-year-old neighborhood restaurant and bakery on the coast in northern Oregon is yet another casualty of the pandemic. Owners John and Lisa Allen had just invested in a renovation of the dining room when the crisis hit, and they said they got no response when they applied for a Paycheck Protection Program grant that might have helped them hang on. In announcing their decision to close permanently, Lisa Allen told the Seaside Signal \"We cannot financially ruin ourselves to the point where we would sell our home and live on the street.\"\n\nOregon: Clyde Common\n\n• Location: Portland\n\nThis downtown Portland eatery is credited with having helped to animate the city's vibrant food scene when it opened more than a decade ago. The owners announced in early May that the financial effects of the pandemic had made it impossible to reopen, though they report that they might install a simpler restaurant in the same location in the future.\n\nPennsylvania: Alexander's Italian Bistro\n\n• Location: Pittsburgh\n\nThe Colaizzi family has owned this restaurant in Bloomfield, Pittsburgh's Little Italy, since opening it as Alto's in 1958. (It was renamed Alexander's in 1977.) It closed for what was hoped to be a temporary period on March 12, but subsequently announced on its website that it was closing permanently. \"My wish as I end this letterâ¦,\" wrote current proprietor Kimberly Colaizzi Ifft on the site, \"is that you remember all the great memories with my dad and our crew.\"\n\nPennsylvania: Original Hot Dog Shop\n\n• Location: Pittsburgh\n\nOpened in 1960 across the street from now-defunct Forbes Field, then home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, this iconic institution in the center of the University of Pittsburgh campus has apparently served its last burgers, dogs, and famous fries. Though there has been no official announcement, reports confirm that \"The O,\" as it was known, has been emptied out, and its website no longer operates.\n\nSouth Carolina: McCrady's\n\n• Location: Charleston\n\nKnown for the avant-garde tasting menus introduced by noted chef Sean Brock (who departed in 2018), McCrady's will not resume serving even after restrictions are lifted. David Howard, president of Neighborhood Dining Group, which owns the restaurant, issued a statement saying in part that \"we've come to the difficult decision that McCrady's...will no longer be viable in this changed business environmentâ¦.\" The group's Mexican restaurant, Minero, upstairs from McCrady's, will also close for good, though a new location is planned on nearby Johns Island.\n\nSouth Carolina: Yesterdays Restaurant and Tavern\n\n• Location: Columbia\n\nThis 43-year-old institution in the South Carolina capital's Five Points neighborhood closed in early April, expecting to possibly reopen. However, co-owner Scottie MacRae told the newspaper The State in late April that \"with heavy but grateful hearts...we've decided to hang it up for good.\"\n\nTennessee: Grove Grill\n\n• Location: Memphis\n\nThis restaurant in the Laurelwood Shopping Center would have turned 23 in October, but the owners announced in early May that it would not reopen. Chef-owner Jeffrey Dunham told Memphis Flyer that he had been counting on \"early summer business, graduation, Easter, and Mother's Day and all that to get us going.\" Unfortunately, he added, \"[W]hen this hit, it just set us too far behind.\"\n\nTexas: Threadgill's\n\n• Location: Austin\n\nOpened as a gas station and beer bar in 1933, this Austin institution evolved into a full-scale restaurant and leading music venue, spawning a second location in 1996. That one closed in 2018, and now the original Threadgill's is for sale and will not reopen.\n\nTexas: Barry's Pizza\n\n• Location: Houston\n\nThis iconic pizzeria closed in late May after 37 years in business. \"Well, friends, it's official,\" read a message on the restaurant's Facebook page, posted on May 26. \"Covid 19 killed Barry's.\" By May 28, almost 2,000 fans of the place had posted comments lamenting the closure or paying tribute to the place.\n\nVirginia: Citizen\n\n• Location: Richmond\n\nAfter almost a decade, this downtown sandwich shop pulled the plug on March 18.

Inspectors in the Czech Republic said Monday they found traces of horse meat in frozen meatballs made in Sweden for the furniture maker.\n\nIKEA spokeswoman Ylva Magnusson said meatballs from the same batch had gone out to Slovakia, Hungary, France, Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland. Magnusson said meatballs from that batch were taken off the shelves in IKEA stores in all those countries.\n\nOther shipments of meatballs were not affected, including to the USA, even though they all come from the same Swedish supplier, Magnusson said.\n\n\"Our global recommendation is to not recall or stop selling meatballs,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities are finding out that tracing the origins of the horse-meat scandal is a bit like playing Whac-A-Mole.\n\nOver the weekend, horse meat was found on pizza in Denmark. Last week, Swiss food giant Nestle and frozen foodmaker Birds Eye were forced to withdraw products from supermarkets in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nAgriculture ministers from the European Union met in Brussels on Monday to address the growing crisis. Some, like Germany's Ilse Aigner, see a solution in more stringent rules for ingredients labeling.\n\nThe Irish want more to be done about what they contend is often deliberate fraud. Owen Paterson, the U.K.'s environment minister, has said that he wants to see \"concrete, coordinated action right across Europe.\"\n\nOne of the first news to break on the scandal involved Findus, a European firm that was found to be producing a beef lasagna \"ready meal\" or frozen dinner that testing revealed in some instances contained 60% to 100% horse meat.\n\nAn investigation in the U.K. by the BBC's Panorama television program revealed that Findus' meat-processing supply chain is complex to say the least.\n\nFindus' beef lasagna had what the BBC investigators called an \"extraordinary journey before\" making its way to the U.K.'s supermarket shelves.\n\n\"The beef had in fact started life in Romania. Only at that point it wasn't a cow,\" said the BBC's Richard Bilton, who lead the fact-finding mission.\n\nIt appears that the horse meat was re-labeled a beef when it left Transylvania The Romanian company CarmOlimp, which produced the meat, said it is confident that it exported 100% horse and its products were labeled as such. It denied involvement in any label switching.\n\nEuropean investigators alleged that Findus' Romanian horse became a cow when it reached the town of Breda, in the Netherlands. The Dutch are still investigating this. The horse/cow then showed up in France at the meat production operation Spanghero, near the border with Spain.\n\nAt Spanghero, Findus' horse/cow checked in as Romanian horse meat but it checked out as European Union beef. Barthélémy Aguerre, Spanghero's chief executive, said: \"I don't apologize because I don't feel responsible. I think the responsibility lies elsewhere.\"\n\nIn Luxembourg? That's where the meat went next and finally became a burger at a Findus factory before being shipped back to the U.K. and across Europe.\n\nIn the age of the multiple-use factory, as well as meat sourcing from a multitude of suppliers, the European experience may not be unique.\n\n\"We (the U.S.) get meat from lots of countries,\" said Marion Nestle, a food studies professor at New York University, in e-mailed comments. \"One U.S. Department of Agriculture study said that a single pound of hamburger meat might come from 400 different cows.\n\n\"If there was a lot of horse meat around, it could easily get mixed in and nobody would notice if nobody checked,\" she said.\n\nNestle said that while Congress permits horses to be slaughtered in the USA it won't allow inspectors to be paid out of tax revenues, effectively banning slaughter. Instead, the horses are sent to Canada and Mexico to be killed, she wrote in a blog post on her website foodpolitics.com, totalling as many as 140,000 since 2006.\n\nMalcolm Walker, chief executive of Iceland, a British supermarket caught up in Europe's escalating horse meat scandal, told the BBC it did not routinely test the genus of its meat.\n\n\"Did we test for horse? No, but we didn't test for cat or dog either,\" he said. \"There might be dog and cat.\"\n\nOr even fish. Last week an environmental group Oceana said its own investigating revealed that seafood routinely sold in restaurants and supermarkets across America may not be what it is labeled. The most common mislabeling included red snapper and white tuna. One-third of it may routinely be sold under false pretenses.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/restaurants/2018/08/09/highest-grossing-restaurants-in-america/37227589/", "title": "These are the 50 highest grossing restaurants in the US", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe restaurant business is a tough one. The average lifespan of a restaurant is five years and by some estimates, up to 90 percent of new ones fail within the first year. There are, however, some very successful exceptions that manage to rake in millions of dollars a year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed food service trade publication Restaurant Business’s latest annual ranking of the top 100 independent restaurants in America, which is based on their reported or estimated gross food and beverage sales for the year. They define independents, for the survey’s purposes, as restaurants with no more than five locations. Fewer than a dozen of the places on this list are single-operator restaurants.\n\nThe most recent Restaurant Business rankings, sponsored by Campbell’s, were published late last year, based on figures from 2016. The shuttering in late July of one of their top 50 establishments, Carnevino (No. 23), due to sexual misconduct allegations, inspired us to take a new look at the list. In the course of doing that, we discovered that two other restaurants in the top 50 have also closed since the list was published. There’s no indication that these two went out of business for financial reasons, but the fact that even restaurants that are phenomenally successful can close might serve as a reminder that sales and profits are not the same thing.\n\nPerusal of this list reveals a few interesting facts. First, American diners are obviously carnivorous, as 16 of the top 50 are steakhouses or focus strongly on meat. Second, though Los Angeles has been getting much publicity lately as the country’s new food capital, it shows poorly on the list of top grossing restaurants, with only one restaurant making the cut. New York City, on the other hand, accounts for 20 of the 50. Next in line are Las Vegas, Chicago and vicinity, and Washington, D.C. Finally, celebrity chefdom apparently doesn’t mean very much when it comes to serious financial success. Only half a dozen of these highly grossing restaurants have or had famed culinary personalities attached. Two of those are among the places that have since closed, and two more are no longer associated with the noted names.\n\nSome of the restaurants on this list serve breakfast (and brunch), lunch, and dinner, while others are open only in the evenings; many are open seven days a week, while others might close for a day or two. These factors obviously influence the number of meals served annually. The restaurant industry usually computes “average check” (or “check average”) by dividing total sales by number of those meals. In some instances in this list, the math doesn’t work out, but that’s most likely because the restaurants in question (especially those with nightclubs and/or large bars or lounges) racked up substantial sales from alcohol unaccompanied by meals.\n\nMore: Employment trends: 20 jobs that have become dominated by women\n\n50.

He went on to describe a cocktail that tasted like radiator fluid and formaldehyde, \"deeply unlovable\" nachos, and Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders that were \"very far from awesome.\" That didn't stop a couple of million Fieri fans from lining up outside to sample his \"off-the-hook\" cooking over the next five years. They're not lining up anymore. Notwithstanding the restaurant's healthy annual sales, Fieri and his backers closed the place on Dec. 31, 2017 for reasons that were never explained.\n\nMore: US cities where incomes are shrinking at the fastest pace\n\n41.

There is a newer Shaw's in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg.\n\n40. Tavern on the Green\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y. Annual sales: $17,200,000 (est.)\n\n$17,200,000 (est.)

Controversial city planner Robert Moses turned it into a restaurant in 1934. Over the years, the fortunes of the place ebbed and flowed, and the management changed frequently. Restaurant impresario Warner LeRoy ran it from 1976 to 1988; famed chef Jeremiah Tower took over the kitchen for a scant five months in 2014 and '15. Today, under Philadelphia restaurateurs Jim Caiola and David Salama, it seems to have found its groove with solid cooking and a something-for-everyone menu that includes kale and quinoa salad, grilled baby octopus, and roasted organic chicken.\n\n39.

It has proven popular with a wide range of sports stars as well as celebrities like actors Colin Farrell and John Cusack, who were presumably tempted by its bone-in prime rib, prime steaks, and fresh seafood -- and maybe even by its foot-long Kobe beef hot dog.\n\n37.

Hundreds of farms involved supply raw materials to the restaurants. The fare is mostly home-style — skillet cornbread, fried green tomatoes, chicken pot pie, Yankee pot roast, pork chops — and there are numerous sandwiches and homemades pastas. Founding Farmers also serves proprietary \"farm-to-still\" rye whisky, gin, and Peruvian pisco brandy.\n\nMore: SNAP benefits: Which cities have the most people on food stamps?\n\n36.

The no-nonsense menu is centered around prime corn-fed Black Angus beef, aged for 40 days. There's also plenty of seafood, including a spicy lobster cocktail, as well as spit-roasted chicken, baby back ribs, and a charbroiled burger. Owned by the Gibsons Restaurant Group, this Gibsons is across from Rosemont's Donald E. Stephens Convention Center.\n\n35.

It's easy to see the appeal. The kitchen seems more concerned with satisfying cravings than breaking new ground. Thus: a raw bar, tomato soup, Caesar salad, ricotta gnocchi, lobster roll, two burgers, five steaks (with fries or field greens), spaghetti and meatballs as a Sunday special…. You get the idea.\n\n34.

A raw bar and an artisanal cheese selection round out the menu, and breakfast and brunch are served. The restaurant's corporate parent, BR Guest Hospitality, which runs 17 restaurants in New York, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Las Vegas, was acquired in late 2016 by the massive Landry's, Inc., which itself oversees more than 600 restaurants, hotels, casinos, and sports teams across the country.\n\n32.

Meals served annually: 110,000\n\nThis elegant, justifiably pricey Italian restaurant is described on its website as a \"creation of Joe Bastianich, Lidia Bastianich and Executive Chef Melissa Rodriguez.\" That's true as far as it goes, but the missing name on that list is the now-disgraced Mario Batali, whose vision was essential to the place for more than a decade. Opened in 2005, Del Posto got a three-star review in the New York Times the following year, and then a four-star ranking — the paper's highest restaurant accolade — in 2010. No other Italian place had reached that level since 1974. Chef Rodriguez -- who joined the staff in 2011, was promoted to chef de cuisine in 2015, and became executive chef last year -- prepares refined but full-flavored versions of many Italian classics, including vitello tonnato, orecchiette with rabbit sausage and turnips, and the seafood stew called cacciucco livornese.\n\n31. Acme Feed & Seed\n\nLocation: Nashville, Tennessee\n\nNashville, Tennessee Avg. check: $16\n\n$16 Meals served annually: 611,454\n\nBuilt in 1890, the building now occupied by Acme Feed & Seed has housed a grocery store, a flour company, and a wholesale drug firm, among other tenants, and from 1943 to 1999 it was home to the business that became known as Acme Farm Supply. After that closed, the structure was occupied only occasionally until 2014, when Nashville chef-restaurateur and caterer Tom Morales took it over. In the space, he created a four-level complex with a \"funkytonk\" on the ground floor, serving such fare as hot chicken sandwich, gorgonzola meatloaf, and \"redneck lo mein;\" a lounge and bar with sushi bar and bar food on the second level; an event and music venue on the third floor; and an open-air bar on the roof.\n\nMore: US population boom: Fastest growing county in every state\n\n30.

There's a salad bar, a selection of fresh fish, and some meat dishes marked on the menu as \"for the landlubber.\" Some 13 variations on surf & turf are also offered.\n\n29.

The restaurant's winning customer-suggested dessert is cheesecake ice cream with Key lime pie ribbons, graham cracker crunch, and toasted marshmallow swirl. T.G.I.

The menu is steakhouse-standard: shrimp cocktail, baked clams, spinach salad, extra-thick veal and lamb chops, lobster, swordfish, and of course steak. The wine list is immense and justly famous, and there are private rooms that can seat up to 250 people.\n\n27. The Smith (Lincoln Square)\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y.

Burke, the celebrity chef who has opened and closed a number of restaurants in New York and elsewhere, actually left the place in 2014 but didn't take his name off it until last year. Despite its success, the restaurant, which is located in the James Hotel, closed on Dec. 9 and is scheduled to be reinvented soon as The James Kitchen + Bar.\n\n25.

He is also a showman, well-suited to Las Vegas, where this carnivore's paradise offers an array of tartares, carpaccios, and cured meats; steaks galore, including Japanese Kobe; roast suckling pig (by special order); and, just for variety, caviar tasting flights and what the menu calls \"meats from the sea\" like whole turbot and grilled Maine lobster.\n\n23.

The design of this three-level, 300-seat place is appropriately theatrical, with a dining room dominated by a 16-foot-tall seated Buddha above a virtual reflecting pool.\n\nDim sum and other small plates such as rock shrimp lettuce cups, and chicken satay, as well as Chinese-style spareribs, tempura vegetables, sushi and sashimi, seafood in various guises, kung pao chicken, and a grilled Kobe ribeye with yuzu cilantro butter are among the menu choices.

It can be debated whether yellowtail crudo with blueberry and ginger, avocado toast with peas and radishes, or a 50-day-dry-aged 36-ounce tomahawk ribeye steak were \"[i]nspired by street food from around the world,\" as the website puts it, but there is certainly a multi-cultural flavor to such dishes as roasted squash tostadas, shawarma salad, tortilla soup dumplings, and wild mushroom \"street pizza.\"\n\n11.

Less in the deli mode are such appetizers as Thai ginger BBQ wings, disco fries, and seven barbecue shrimp, chicken, and ribs choices. When this first Junior's in Manhattan's Times Square neighborhood opened in 2006, according to the restaurant website, its \"Brooklyn NY\" sign confused would-be customers who thought they'd come out of the subway at the wrong stop.

Gibsons was the first restaurant group in the country to be granted its own USDA Prime certification, and it serves only Midwestern grass-fed Black Angus beef plus a couple of 75-day-aged Australian grass-fed cuts. The menu is similar to that at the Rosemount restaurant, and prices are basically the same.\n\n9.

Launched by the founder of the Wetzel Pretzel chain, early backers included NBA superstar LeBron James, Maria Shriver and Boston Red Sox co-owner Tom Werner. It seems they were onto something — since its debut seven years ago, Blaze has added more than 250 locations in about 40 states, and just expanded into the Middle East. This move is bringing freshly made, fast, customized pizzas that are better than your regular fast food to much of America. The small number of states left off the Blaze map skew towards less populous, such as Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming.\n\nThe setup is modeled on made-to-order assembly line eateries like Chipotle, and in fact, many business analysts have called Blaze the “Chipotle of Pizza,” but it is more directly similar to 800 Degrees Pizza (currently rebranding as 800° Woodfired Kitchen Pizza + Rotisserie), a small chain (Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Japan, Middle East and coming soon to New York City) that Great American Bites profiled previously.\n\nGreat American Bites:Philadelphia's pilgrimage-worthy pizzeria\n\nThe model is simple but elegant and sits between fast food and fast casual. You order at a counter where you select your crust style, then the nascent pizza moves down the line with you, as you select sauces, cheeses, other toppings, and if you want, salad. At the end of the process the pizza goes into a very high temperature oven where it cooks in about three minutes and your name is called to pick it up. There is no table service, but the restaurants have more of a sit-down feel with nicer tables of heavy wood, a spacious café-like atmosphere, homey painted murals, and self-serve stands with condiments and to-go boxes since the one-size-fits-all individual pizzas are a bit much for most customers.\n\nReason to visit: Mix and match toppings, thick crust option.\n\nThe food: The best things about Blaze are the endless variety options, better quality ingredients, made-to-order nature of the pies, and the incredibly friendly and well-trained staff that makes eating here a feel-good experience. The first question the staff asks every visitor is whether you have eaten here before, in order to better explain how it works. The pizza is clearly better than the national chains with which Blaze competes, and despite the red-hot oven, flames and thinner crust, do not mistake this for the now trendy, gourmet, Neapolitan-style, brick-oven pizza experience that has swept the country in recent years. You don’t go to Blaze for great pizza, you go for good pizza that’s better than other fast food options at a fair price.\n\nThe main event here is pizza, with nine pre-selected signature options, including Meat Lovers, Veg Out, BBQ Chicken and so on, and any of these can be modified, in fact you are strongly encouraged to do so. Then there are one topping, two topping and the BYO (build your own) options, and one of the very unique things about Blaze is that almost all of the pizzas are one price. With BYO, you can choose as many toppings as you want, really, and there are a staggering array to choose from, many of which are normally considered “premium.” This makes dining here an exercise in restraint or excess depending on your personality, and you could come countless times without repeating the permutations.\n\nThe sauce options alone are bewildering, including basic and spicy tomato, white cream, two kinds of pesto, barbecue, olive oil, ranch, Buffalo and balsamic glaze. There are eight cheese choices, 17 veggie toppings and seven proteins. The variety of options includes some really nice and offbeat choices such as turkey meatballs in addition to regular ones, roasted whole garlic cloves and chopped (this is one of my favorite extras, adding a deeper, richer but milder garlic flavor), fresh ovalini mozzarella and the usual shredded, and so on. No other fast-food pizza place is going to serve you fresh mozzarella, goat or gorgonzola cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, artichokes and pesto, all for no extra charge. There is even a gluten-free crust option and vegan “cheese.”\n\nThe very thin crust combined with the hot, fast cook gives just a touch of flavorful char (the attention to detail is incredible and there is a person who just inspects the bottom of each pie out of the oven to avoid excess blackening). There is a great freshness to the final result, but the crust itself is a bit bland. In general, I find the toppings superior to the crust, especially standouts like meatballs, banana peppers, roasted garlic and more creative cheeses, though I would stay away from the chicken, cut into a small dice and fairly tasteless.\n\nOn my second visit I opt for the thicker “high rise dough” option, which is on the menu but not prominently advertised, and in three trips I only see one other person order it. You can tell, because due to the slightly longer cook time, it is partially cooked on a black metal mesh tray to keep the bottom form burning. While clearly less popular, this is a great secret weapon at Blaze. I prefer the thicker crust, which has a little more substance and a light doughy chewiness reminiscent of hot-from-the-oven roils, without being too thick or overpowering. It is well worth the small surcharge (less than a dollar).\n\nMore:America's pizza capitals\n\nSalads are composed in the same fashion as the pizzas as you walk down the line, and once again you are encouraged to mix, match and even combine dressings and toppings. I wouldn’t go here strictly for the salads, but again, they are fresher and better than you will get at competitors, and nicely loaded with toppings — my Caesar has penalty of cheese and crunchy croutons.\n\nBlaze has fountain soft drinks, as well as some custom lemonades and agua frescas in bubblers, some bottled beer (which may vary by location), and a very limited dessert menu. The one that jumps out for creativity is a s’mores sandwich, which comes pre-stacked with the option of heating up at home, or eating fresh and warm after a quick dip in the pizza oven. It’s a great idea, but unfortunately these look better than they taste, mainly due to an odd choice of swapping the traditional graham crackers for Scottish McVitie’s brand biscuits, a failed upgrade that just doesn’t taste right and ultimately disappoints.\n\nThat said, I come away with massive respect for Blaze, and I love the way the place works — the attention to detail throughout, the amazing staff, the toppings, and the best pizza you are going to get five minutes after pulling into a suburban strip mall parking lot in most of the country.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but if you want pizza on a road trip in most of the country, you won’t do better.\n\nRating: Mmmm (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\n\nPrice: $-$$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\n\nDetails: More than 250 locations in 80% of the USA – and growing fast; blazepizza.com\n\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.

Va ...", "text": "Jeff Mordock\n\nThe News Journal\n\nPARKERSBURG, W. Va. – No one in the Mid-Ohio Valley ever wanted to sue DuPont.\n\nThe company employs thousands in the region and supports charities and community organizations. In some families, multiple generations owe their livelihood to the Delaware-based chemical giant.\n\nBut as livestock started dying and thousands of residents contracted unexplained illnesses, evidence pointed to pollution from DuPont manufacturing as the cause – pitting the community's health against the area's already struggling economy.\n\n\"A guy called my wife and asked, 'If I lose my job are you going to pay for my wife and kids?'\" said Joe Kiger, a Parkersburg, West Virginia, school teacher and the lead plaintiff in the 2001 class-action lawsuit against DuPont over high levels of the toxic chemical C8 in the region's water supplies.\n\nC8 is the chemical behind DuPont's powerhouse product Teflon, used on nonstick cookware worldwide. Studies have shown that nearly every person on earth has at least traces of C8 in their bloodstream. But in 2005 around Parkersburg, about 2 miles from DuPont's Washington Works manufacturing plant, residents' blood levels registered far above Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for C8.\n\nThe company now faces 3,500 lawsuits filed in Federal Court by Mid-Ohio Valley residents in a 185-square-mile area around Parkersburg. They claim DuPont's release of C8 into the air, ground and water is responsible for their illnesses. Regulatory filings show DuPont's liability could exceed $1 billion.\n\nBetween 1951 and 2003, the Washington Works plant dumped, poured and released more than 1.7 million pounds of C8, according to a 2004 study by ChemRisk Inc., an industry risk assessor hired by DuPont to determine how much of the chemical had been released into the environment.\n\nThat study discovered 632,468 pounds of the chemical traveled through Washington Works outflow pipes into the Ohio River, where C8 moved upstream, downstream and found its way into tributaries.\n\nAnother 394,486 pounds was transported via truck to three unlined landfills, where it was buried in the ground. The material leeched into the soils, contaminating wells and groundwater.\n\nThe largest amount, 686,223 pounds, was forced through smokestacks into the air, where it was breathed in by area residents and settled on their skin. The powdery smoke also landed on crops and in water supplies.\n\nChemRisk President Dennis J. Paustenbach, who has won multiple awards for his research, and three of its scientists – Julie M. Panko, Paul K. Scott, and Kenneth M. Unice, who have a combined 61 years of health, risk and exposure study experience – conducted the DuPont-funded report.\n\nTheir work was later given to the C8 Science Panel, a team of researchers who performed health studies on Mid-Ohio Valley residents in the release zone around Parkersburg between 2005 and 2013. It was created as part of the settlement in a class-action lawsuit against DuPont.\n\nDuPont doesn't deny that C8, or PFOA, is dangerous to humans. But the company points out, through spokesman Dan Turner, that industry knowledge of the chemical on the environment and worker health has slowly evolved over the past 60 years – and DuPont was a leader in creating guidelines to protect staff.\n\n\"While federal and state environmental authorities never established regulations on the use, handling, emissions or disposal of PFOA, DuPont set extremely conservative exposure guidelines to guard against harm,\" he said. \"DuPont took more precautions in the use and handling of PFOA than any other company.\"\n\nEarly tests conducted on the chemical revealed health issues in animals, but humans were not included in the studies. Once DuPont understood C8's effects, Turner said, it completely phased out its use of the chemical, a process completed in 2013.\n\nDuPont's statement on Parkersburg\n\nBy then, though, a lot of people were ill along the Ohio River, and battle lines had hardened over whether DuPont was culpable. And that fight continues today.\n\nOn one side are residents suffering from illnesses such as kidney and testicular cancer, liver disease, thyroid problems, high cholesterol and heart problems. On the other side are those who claim the issue has been overblown by plaintiffs' attorneys looking to make a fortune by attacking the deep-pocketed company.\n\nThose fighting serious illnesses allege DuPont knowingly covered up the danger of C8, pointing to a November 1982 memo in which Bruce Karrh, the company's chief medical director, expressed concern over employees' exposure. The company barred women of child-bearing age from working in the laboratory where they would come in contact with the chemical.\n\n\"My ex-husband was told not to launder his clothes with my daughter's clothes,\" Kiger's wife, Darlene, said of her former spouse, who worked directly with C8. Darlene said her ex-husband received that warning from plant management as far back as the mid-1970s.\n\nThose upset with neighbors suing DuPont contend that many plaintiffs were not exposed to C8 at levels high enough to develop cancer or other illnesses. Pollution from other chemical companies in the region also could have played an unknowing role in the illnesses.\n\n\"I believe in facts, and I believe that sometimes what the press lives and dies off of is headlines,\" said Parkersburg Mayor Jimmy Colombo, who owns a popular downtown Italian restaurant. \"There are people who have cancer treatments every day who are not involved in the stuff (C8) you are talking about.\"\n\nThe region's economic viability is at the center of the debate. At its height, DuPont employed roughly 2,000 workers at its Washington Works plant, roughly 6 miles south of Parkersburg. That number was reduced to around 1,200 prior to DuPont transferring the facility's ownership to Chemours last July. For the first time in nearly 70 years, the iconic DuPont sign no longer greets workers and visitors.\n\nColombo says the C8 controversy has cost the region. In 2003, frozen foods company Luigino's proposed a $36 million plant at the Parkersburg Business Park that would have created 600 new jobs. Colombo and former Mayor Bob Newell said the company dropped out over fears that competitors would use the area's environmental issues to discourage consumers from buying food packaged in a polluted area. Minnesota-based Luigino's did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus, of the Southern District of Ohio, is the sole jurist assigned to handle the litigation. Under a scheduling order issued by Sargus, the court will hear 40 cases annually – meaning it will take 90 years to resolve all cases.\n\nDuPont has settled three lawsuits, two for undisclosed amounts and a third, class-action lawsuit for $70 million. In another case, a woman who developed kidney cancer won a $1.6 million judgment that the company is appealing.\n\nNow involved in a $130 billion merger with Dow Chemical Co., DuPont has an indemnification agreement with its performance chemical spinoff, Chemours, under which Chemours is responsible for any damages DuPont incurs in the C8 litigation.\n\nHowever, Chemours, which occupies DuPont's former headquarters in downtown Wilmington, has shed jobs and seen its stock price plummet since becoming an independent company last summer. That has raised questions about whether it can absorb the liability.\n\nThe company first came to West Virginia in 1948, attracted by the region's industrious workforce and access the Ohio River would give it to ports throughout the country. A decade earlier, Roy J. Plunkett, a DuPont chemist based in the company's Salem, New Jersey, plant was experimenting with refrigerants and discovered an inert fluorocarbon that had nonstick and stain-resistant qualities. The company patented the substance in 1945 under the trademark \"Teflon.\" It was used to coat cookware and quickly became a hit, with annual sales in 2007 reaching $1 billion.\n\nWashington Works quickly became the world's largest producer of Teflon, manufacturing nearly 2 million pounds of the product in its first year of operation.\n\nIn 1951, DuPont also began purchasing C8, known as perfluoroctaonic acid, or PFOA, from Minnesota Manufacturing & Mining, which now operates as 3M. The chemical, which resembles laundry soap, possessed better nonstick qualities and flattened bulges that occurred during Teflon manufacturing. It soon became widely popular, used in hundreds of products including fast-food wrappers, waterproof clothing, microwaveable popcorn bags and pizza boxes.\n\nDuPont began studying the health effects of C8 in the 1950s, but those tests were kept secret, according to documents released as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's investigation into DuPont. In the early 1960s, DuPont scientists found the chemical increased the size of livers in rats, rabbits and dogs. By the 1980s, a 3M study discovered C8 caused birth defects in rats. 3M shared the study with DuPont, and began to phase out the use of C8 by 2002.\n\nYet some of those involved in the lawsuits allege DuPont did not notify its workers or change its safety procedures.\n\n\"3M was making millions (of dollars) off this stuff, but DuPont was making billions,\" said Harry Deitzler, a Parkersburg attorney and local counsel suing DuPont.\n\nThe inspiration behind 'Harry's Project'\n\nThe company continued to secretly test its Washington Works employees over decades, often uncovering disturbing health issues found in blood samples. In Karrh's November 1982 memo, he wrote that worker exposure to the chemical should be limited, according to documents uncovered in a class action lawsuit, Leach v. DuPont.\n\nTo qualify as a member of the class action, an individual must have drank contaminated water for at least one year prior to Dec. 4, 2004, from one of the six named water districts or a specified private well contaminated with C8. DuPont spent $70 million to settle the case in 2005.\n\nShortly after the Leach settlement, the EPA fined DuPont $16.5 million for not reporting the health risks related to C8 exposure. At the time, it was the largest civil penalty ever levied by the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurner denied DuPont withheld information about health issues related to C8 from its employees.\n\n\n\n\"In the 1970s when DuPont first learned that PFOA was persistent in the bodies of the 3M workers, our leaders took reasonable actions to inform and protect employees, to understand the available science regarding potential health effects in animals and people, to seek guidance from knowledgeable third party experts and to engage regulators,\" the company spokesman said.\n\n\n\nIn 2006, DuPont became one of eight companies vowing to reduce PFOA manufacturing emissions by 95 percent within four years and eliminate its use completely in less than a decade.\n\nPaul Brooks, a physician who oversaw the blood tests for thousands of Mid-Ohio Valley residents, said C8 is unique because it attaches itself to blood proteins and travels through, and attacks, every organ in the body. According to Brooks, it damages the thyroid in the endocrine system; harms the digestive system causing ulcerative colitis; impacts the reproductive system causing preeclampsic hypertension in women and testicular cancer in men; and attacks the urinary system causing kidney cancer.\n\n\"Scientifically, most of the time when you get something that effects the body, like asbestos, it only affects one or two things,\" he said.\n\nAnother series of secret DuPont tests conducted in 1984 found high levels of C8 in tap water of the Little Hocking Water Association just across the Ohio River from the Washington Works plant. DuPont continued the tests through 1989, but never informed the community or state regulators, according to internal corporate documents that came out as part of discovery during the Leach trial. DuPont assumed one part per billion was safe – but Little Hocking's PFOA levels were three times that number.\n\nDust containing C8 released from the facilities' chimney stacks was found well beyond the Washington Work's property, according to the C8 Science Panel created under the Leach settlement.\n\nIn Delaware, C8 contamination blamed on firefighting foam\n\nJim Tennant, a former construction worker at DuPont, said he has suffered from mysterious illnesses since the 1960s. Shortly after starting at DuPont in 1964, Tennant said, he would randomly get flu-like systems, including cold and clammy hands, and drops in blood pressure, respiration and temperature. Doctors were baffled.\n\nIn 1979, Tennant was hospitalized. Doctors couldn't identify the cause, and warned his wife Della that he might not make it through the night.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Jim and Della began noticing dead birds and deer on their farm. Cattle developed large tumors, went blind or gave birth to deformed and stillborn calves. Jim Tennant said the normal mortality rate for newborn cattle was around 5 percent, but at times, 100 percent of the herd's newborn calves died. In total, Jim estimates the family lost roughly 250 cows.\n\nAnd there was a strange silence on the property.\n\n\"You couldn't even hear a bird chirp,\" Della Tennant said. \"Everything was dead.\"\n\nThe Tennants suspected the Dry Run landfill, a 66-acre DuPont dump site less than 250 feet from their back door.\n\nIn 1980, DuPont first approached the couple with an offer to buy their farm to turn it into a landfill. The family resisted, but as Jim's medical bills mounted the Tennants in 1983 finally relented, and sold a portion of their 600-acre farmstead to DuPont. Della said DuPont assured the couple it would create a Class II landfill on their former property, meaning it would not contain hazardous materials. At the time, the company provided a document assuring them only scrap metal, scrap lumber and cafeteria garbage would be sent to the landfill, Jim said.\n\nBut the dead and malformed animals kept piling up, and the Tennants wanted to sue DuPont for damages. Conditions got so bad the couple had to stop farming.\n\nThe Tennants' efforts to retain legal counsel in the Parkersburg area were unsuccessful. Local attorneys said they didn't have the clout to sue the Fortune 500 company. And as word spread about the Tennants' plans, neighbors began to fight back. When the family walked into restaurants, Della said, other citizens would walk out. Longtime friends stopped speaking with them at church, and the Tennants had to change their place of worship more than once.\n\n\"People accused us of trying to get DuPont to shut down,\" she said. \"But we weren't trying to get DuPont to shut down. We were trying to get them to clean up their mess.\"\n\nThings changed dramatically when attorney Rob Bilott, moved by their plight, agreed to take the case. Recommended by a family friend, Bilott, an environmental attorney with the Cincinnati firm of Taft Stettinius & Hollister, made his reputation as a corporate lawyer who defended companies against environmental charges brought by people like the Tennants.\n\nBut as soon as he heard their story, he signed on.\n\nEarl Botkin lives in Evans, West Virginia, a small town about 45 miles downriver from the Washington Works plant. Botkin says he was a healthy man of 55 in 1997 when he began to experience thyroid problems, and soon contracted ulcerative colitis – a form of explosive diarrhea – and high cholesterol.\n\nThe C8 Health Panel, which tested 69,000 residents in the area, linked all three illnesses to exposure to the chemical. Botkin believes his health problems stemmed from consuming tap water tainted with C8, which allegedly found its way into the municipal water system of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, which at the time supplied water to Evans. Botkin's wife, Gwen, does not have any illnesses associated with C8 exposure.\n\nDuPont has said it will not challenge the supposition that drinking water tainted with high levels of C8 can cause ulcerative colitis, thyroid problems and a host of other illnesses. But DuPont will challenge specific cases brought by plaintiffs like Botkin, who consumed water from a system that was not part of the $70 million settlement awarding sophisticated water filtration systems for six municipalities.\n\nBotkin says his life is hell. His days begin at 4 a.m. with coffee and a piece of toast. He needs to eat early so he can digest his food, go to the bathroom and be at work by 8:00 a.m. Botkin eats only a small snack during the day to limit his trips to the bathroom. His big daily meal is dinnertime, and he takes it at home where he has immediate access to a bathroom.\n\nHe takes eight steroids a day to stop the bleeding, which makes his face and stomach puffy but does little to help him manage the disease.\n\nThe Botkins rarely leave home for fear of having an embarrassing episode outside the home. If he does go out, he must take precautions and scout ahead for a clean bathroom.\n\nBotkin has kept his job as a home inspector because he needs the insurance to cover the cost of his medicine. He says the multiple diseases has made it impossible for him to visit his three children who have relocated to other parts of the country.\n\n\"They really ruined us,\" Botkin said. \"We had nice jobs and were about to retire. We had plans.\"\n\nJames Peterson, of Glenville, West Virginia, was a DuPont contractor who welded parts on trucks that transported waste from the Washington Works plant to the company's two landfills, Dry Run and Letard. From 1983 until 1995, it was his job to fix broken axles and make other repairs. Often, the C8 waste would still be on the truck while he was fixing it.\n\nOn three occasions, Peterson contracted what is locally referred to as \"the Teflon flu\" – fever, chills, headaches and coughs that comes from breathing fumes released from C8.\n\n\"I was sicker than a dog,\" he said. \"I just shook like I had the DTs (delirium tremens normally associated with alcoholism.)\"\n\nWhen Peterson turned 59, he began to suffer heart attacks, which plaintiffs attorneys say is normal for people exposed to C8 because it triggers extraordinarily high levels of cholesterol. In 2001, he had a quintuple bypass and a stent inserted. Six years later, he underwent a sextuple bypass.\n\nAlthough Peterson has insurance, he says his medical bills were so high he had to sell his two-story house to pay for his care. Today he lives in a trailer, and one of his bedrooms is consumed by medical supplies.\n\nArteries that flow blood to his kidneys have closed, causing renal damage. Peterson also has a dialysis machine at home, which he is tethered to daily.\n\n\"I would not be in this shape had I not breathed in that stuff and worked at the landfill,\" he said.\n\nOn Halloween of 2000, school teacher Joe Kiger received a disturbing notice from the Lubeck Water System with his monthly bill, explaining PFOA had been discovered in the municipal drinking water pumped to homeowners in the tiny town of Lubeck, a few miles from DuPont's Washington Works plant. The letter said PFOA levels were \"low concentrations,\" and \"DuPont reports that it has toxicological and epidemiological data to support confidence that exposure to guidelines established by DuPont are protective of human health.\"\n\nAt first, Kiger dismissed it as \"just another form letter.\" Now he believes the contaminated tap water – confirmed by the Environmental Protection Agency to be eight times higher than federal guidelines before filtration equipment was installed –– likely caused him to contract a very high level of cholesterol, and ultimately a heart attack.\n\nShortly after receiving the letter about PFOA in the water, Kiger began hearing about neighbors contracting strange illnesses. A friend told him about her seven-year old granddaughter's teeth turning black. Three young boys came down with testicular cancer. Friends said their dogs developed tumors.\n\nKiger went back to the Lubeck Water System letter, then started questioning the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources. Officials there treated him as if he had the plague, he recalled.\n\nHe received a similar reaction from DuPont's Environmental Health Department in Parkersburg, although he was referred to someone in DuPont's Wilmington headquarters.\n\nHis wife, Darlene, asked how that went.\n\n\"I told her, I was just fed the biggest line of BS in my life,\" he said. \"He told me there was nothing to worry about, which immediately told me I better start worrying.\"\n\nSeven months later, Kiger connected with the EPA's Philadelphia office, where someone said, \"What in the hell is that (C8) doing in your water?\"\n\nThe EPA scientist sent Kiger information about the Tennant case. Kiger noticed attorney Bilott's name as the lead attorney and called him. Bilott had frequently run across the unfamiliar acronym PFOA while researching the Tennants' case, and realized there was potential for a class-action lawsuit against DuPont on behalf of Mid-Ohio Valley residents struggling with illnesses.\n\nBut he didn't have a lead plaintiff until Kiger called. There were only 60 days remaining before the 12-month statute of limitations associated with notice of contaminated drinking water expired, and Bilott quickly filed a class-action suit. But finding other people to sign on proved to be difficult.\n\n\"You are talking livelihood around here,\" Kiger said. \"Everyone in this valley is either somehow related to, has association with someone who works for the company, or works for DuPont themselves.\"\n\nA meeting held to recruit people at downtown Parkersburg's venerable Blennerhasset Hotel became heated. As people stormed out, Kiger followed his friend Jack Leach to the elevator. As Leach tried to leave, Kiger jammed his foot in the elevator door to hold it open, grabbed Leach by the arm and said, \"If this stuff is this bad, we've got to get something done.\"\n\nLeach, a retired DuPont truck driver, was the named plaintiff in the class-action suit. He died later of cancer.\n\nKiger and his wife faced the same harassment levied against the Tennants. Crank calls, things thrown at their house, curses hurled at them as they walked the streets.\n\nSlowly, though, Bilott and Kiger won converts as they made their case at meeting after meeting. More than 70,000 have joined, but a decade after the class action settlement, with nearly 3,500 additional cases stacked up, anger still seethes in the valley.\n\nAllan Ellis, a contractor who has resided in Parkersburg all his life, said residents are trying to put C8 behind them because they need to put food on the table.\n\n\"This valley has been at the top of the cancer chain for years and years, but they (residents) are still here,\" he said. \"As long as jobs are here, it's not going to be you [who contracts cancer]. That's the way people look at it.\"\n\nFormer Mayor Newell says people are not angry at DuPont because of C8. They're angry because DuPont slashed staff and shifted the plant to Chemours.\n\nSome DuPont workers who have lost their jobs have joined other companies, but the salaries, benefits and retirement packages are not as strong, Newell said.\n\n\"There was a lot of pride in working for DuPont,\" he said.\n\nMayor Colombo said he hasn't sensed any outrage in the community over the C8 exposure. He doesn't follow the C8 trials because they won't impact Parkersburg, Colombo said.\n\nDr. Brooks, who conducted the health panel tests, noted that C8 contamination has spread from the Mid-Ohio Valley to drinking water as far south as New Orleans and as far north as Pittsburgh. One of the few places on the planet where C8 pollution has not been detected is Tibet, nearly 12,000 feet above sea level, Brooks said.\n\n\"DuPont has poisoned the world,\" Brooks said.\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.\n\nKarrh Memo on C8 and pregnancy\n\nMemo by DuPont Chief Medical Officer Bruce Karrh, detailing concerns about pregnant women being exposed to C8.\n\n1981 DuPont internal birth defect memo\n\nAn April 1981 DuPont internal document by JW Raines detailing studies that found birth defects in rats exposed to C8.\n\nChemrisk Report\n\nA 2004 report by ChemRisk Inc., a chemical industry risk assessor hired by DuPont to determine how much C8 had been released into the environment.

In its September issue, the fashion magazine said the 40-year-old would bid farewell to tennis “on her own terms – and in her own words”.\n\nIn fact retirement is not a term that she’s ever liked, “it doesn’t feel like a modern word to me”, she wrote. “I’ve been thinking of this as a transition. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”\n\nA few years ago Williams “quietly started” Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, she started a family. “I want to grow that family.”\n\n‘I should have had 30-plus slams’\n\nIt’s “almost the end of an era”, said Amy Lofthouse on BBC Sport. As “one of the greatest tennis players of all time” and a “sporting icon”, it will be “difficult to imagine tennis without the American legend”, who has won “all there is to win” during her 27-year career.\n\nA winner of 23 grand slam singles titles in the open era, Williams is just one behind the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court. In her essay she suggested that the 2022 US Open, which starts on 29 August, will be her farewell event. It was in New York, as a “braided 17-year-old phenomenon”, where she lifted the family’s “first major title” in 1999, said Bryan Armen Graham in The Guardian. Her older sister Venus, a seven-time grand slam champion, won the US Open major a year later and in 2001.\n\nWithin reach of Court’s 24 slams, Williams would “be lying” if she said she didn’t want that record. “Obviously I do,” she wrote. “But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams.”\n\nWith 23 slams and 73 career titles, Williams has “set the marker that matters”, said Tumaini Carayol in The Guardian. “No asterisks needed”, her tennis legacy “goes far beyond statistics”.\n\nIn Vogue’s September issue, @serenawilliams prepares to say farewell to tennis on her own terms and in her own words. “It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine,” she says. “I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next” https://t.co/6Zr0UXVTH1 pic.twitter.com/YtGtcc18a9 — Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) August 9, 2022\n\n‘It hurts like a 120mph serve to the stomach’\n\nWilliams’ retirement will be “a crushing loss” for tennis, said Johnny Oleksinski in the New York Post. “Without a doubt”, she is a “once-in-a-generation athlete” on the “same godlike level” as Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, LeBron James or Tom Brady. “The sports world will be a lot less ferocious or fascinating without her.” We all knew this sad day was coming, but it “still hurts like a 120-miles-per-hour serve to the stomach”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/08/09/serena-williams-retire-tennis-after-us-open-vogue/10274837002/", "title": "Serena Williams to retire from tennis after US Open, she says in Vogue", "text": "Serena Williams is set to retire from tennis in the coming weeks, making the announcement in Vogue's September edition.

Williams and Alexis Ohanian have been married since November 2017 and have one child together.\n\n“In the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family,\" Williams continued. \"I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.”\n\nThe announcement comes just one day after Williams won her first match in over a year on Monday at the National Open in Toronto.\n\nContact Analis Bailey at aabailey@usatoday.com or on Twitter @analisbailey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/08/10/serena-williams-retiring-goat/10282300002/", "title": "Why we'll miss Serena Williams after she retires and what she has ...", "text": "Serena Williams, 40, announced in the latest Vogue issue that she would retire from her tennis career after the U.S. Open, which begins at the end of the month. The 23-time Grand Slam champion and four-time Olympic gold medalist says she wants to grow her family.\n\nUSA TODAY intern Ashley Ahn, who started playing tennis when she was about 5 and had a Serena and Venus Williams racket, and deputy opinion editor/national columnist Suzette Hackney, who met both the Williams sisters at the “King Richard” premiere, discuss the impending retirement and what Williams has meant to them on and off the court. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAhn: My first memory of even just starting tennis and picking up a racket started with Serena. That was around 2005. When I told my mom I wanted to play tennis, she went out and got me racket. And it ended up being a Serena racket with her face and Venus’ face on the cover of the racket. So literally my first memory of tennis is Serena and Venus. Growing up as a tennis player, especially as a little girl watching Serena dominate the sport and not only overcoming the obstacles of her opponents and having to win but also the obstacles as a woman and a woman of color playing tennis – and the discriminatory treatment and negative comments that she’s had to deal with throughout her career – she means more to me than just an amazing tennis player. She transcends beyond the sport itself, which is why I admire her so much.\n\nHackney: I went to the “King Richard” premiere and I was able to meet both Serena and Venus. Talk about feeling like you’re in a room with royalty. The way they carry themselves, the kindness that they emit, just the greatness, and it was overwhelming. I was shy. I’m not typically super outspoken; it took all that I had to just be able to go up to them and say hello, and tell them how much I admired them. It was that big of a deal. I had that big of a celebrity moment.\n\nRussia needs to release Brittney Griner:And US leaders need to fix our cannabis laws\n\nTalk about 2001, when Venus and Serena played each other in the U.S. Open final, the first Grand Slam final between sisters in 117 years.\n\nHackney: They’re both younger than I am, but I watched them as as they rose to this level of greatness. And to see them play each other in a major like that – I remember that moment like it was yesterday. I was glued to my TV, and I was just sobbing. I sobbed throughout the whole match, seeing these strong amazing women accomplish something. I’m the baby sister, and so I thought about how that felt for Serena to have to play her older sister. And what kind of emotion that she had and the mental strength that she had during that match, too. It had to be so difficult.\n\nAnd you know that’s the thing about Serena. I just feel like she has inspired me and so many other Black girls and Black women. She’s taught us to be fearless. She’s taught us to strive to be at the top of our games, and I’m not just talking about athletics, but just in life. What I love about this announcement of her retiring is that she is still controlling her own destiny. And that’s a very powerful thing to me.\n\nAhn: The Gen Z version of getting to watch the Williams sisters go at it at a big finals was Australian Open (in) 2017. It was quite emotional when I was 17 getting to watch them. I was too young to witness their stardom in the 2000s, so I would go on YouTube and watch the Williams sisters’ doubles title (match in 2008) for the Olympics in Beijing. Just witnessing greatness through YouTube.\n\nHackney: Let’s not forget in that 2017 Australian Open, Serena was pregnant when she won. Talk about amazing.\n\nRecord number of women vs. women races:2022 elections could be a new year of the woman\n\nAhn: She’s also shown other female tennis players out there that it’s OK to express your emotions in a raw way on the court. Serena has got a lot of flak for her emotions being too raw or not being as feminine, whereas the men, you know, no one bats an eye when they show their expression and emotion and frustration, so that’s another key point that Serena brings to the game of women’s tennis.\n\nSerena has set a legacy for herself off the court, being a fashion icon, being a business mogul. Can you talk about other aspects of her legacy?\n\nHackney: What I love about her legacy and all the things that she has delved into is that she always puts pressure on herself to be the best of the best. And that’s inspiring. When you think about her as a mother, one of the reasons she said she’s retiring is because she wants to grow her family. And that’s important to her. She said I either have to have two feet in tennis or two feet in, you know, motherhood and being a parent and trying to get pregnant again. She’s choosing that.\n\nAhn: Something that Serena wrote in that Vogue piece that stood out to me was that she wanted to be like Billie Jean King. She wanted to remembered as someone who transcends the sport. If I were to speak to Serena directly – while Billie Jean King was not my generation, Serena is certainly. I grew up looking up to her, so I hope she knows that to all the Gen Z kids who grew up watching her, she is our Billie Jean King. She’s shown us how to hold yourself in the face of discrimination and unfair treatment and negativity, and in fighting for gender equality and such.\n\nWant to improve your mental health?:Helping others can be a good way to help yourself\n\nIt’s heartbreaking to see her leave the sport, but at the same time I’m reminding myself that I should also be congratulating her and celebrating her next chapter, as Suzette said, into motherhood and trying to advance your business goals.\n\nHackney: I’m just grateful. And that’s what I told her when I met her. For years now, I got to watch greatness. I got to watch someone filled with grace, even in her most difficult times on the court when she was losing or, as Ashley said, letting her emotions hang out there, still so graceful. Graceful when she was ill after giving birth and open about talking about that. Helping other women realize (you should) have your doctors listen to you. Listen to your body, you know your body. Grateful for her strength as a Black woman. Just grateful.\n\nMore from Ashley Ahn:\n\n►Are college campuses ready for a post-Roe world?

It doesn't feel like a modern word to me. I've been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I'm up to is evolution. I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Unfortunately I wasn't ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don't know if I will be ready to win New York. But I'm going to try.\"\n\nSince losing her professional debut in September 1995, Williams has become the most dominant force in women's tennis in the last 30 years.\n\nTogether with her old sister Venus, the Williams sisters transformed the sport, making a regular habit of winning grand slams in both singles and doubles tennis.\n\nAt the time of writing, Serena has won 73 career singles titles, 23 doubles titles and two mixed doubles titles which includes 39 grand slam titles -- 23 singles titles, 14 doubles titles and two mixed doubles titles. She is one singles grand slam title behind the all-time record held by Australian Margaret Court.\n\nWhen asked by CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this year if she still wanted to beat Court's record, she replied: \"I should have had it, really, I should -- I've had many opportunities to have it. But I'm not giving up, to answer your question.\"\n\nShe addressed this later in Vogue, saying: \"I know there's a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, 'See ya!' I get that. It's a good fantasy. But I'm not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I'm terrible at goodbyes, the world's worst.\"\n\nThe four-time Olympic gold medalist has won over $94.5 million in career prize money, more than any other female athlete.\n\nAway from the court, Williams announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in 2016, giving birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.\n\nJUST WATCHED Tennis legend's daughter joins her on the court Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tennis legend's daughter joins her on the court 00:43\n\nAnd focusing on her young family, as well as her interests away from tennis, is why she's deciding to step away from the game she has changed forever.\n\n\"Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don't think it's fair,\" Williams explained. \"If I were a guy, I wouldn't be writing this because I'd be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.\n\n\"Maybe I'd be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don't get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital -- although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don't realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I'm turning 41 this month, and something's got to give.\"\n\nThe star also admitted she doesn't like to think about her legacy.\n\n\"I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I'd like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all.\n\n\"Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis.\"", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/08/10/serena-loses-1st-match-since-saying-shes-prepared-to-retire/50586817/", "title": "Serena loses 1st match since saying she's prepared to retire", "text": "AP\n\nTORONTO (AP) — Serena Williams wore her game face when she stepped out into the stadium for her first match since telling the world she is ready to leave professional tennis.\n\nGreeted by a standing ovation, the 23-time Grand Slam champion didn’t smile. She didn’t wave. She took a sip from a plastic bottle as she walked in. Some folks in the crowd captured the moment with the cameras on their cellphones. Others held aloft handrawn signs — oh, so many signs — with messsages such as “Queen” or “Thank you.”\n\nNo one knows exactly how many more matches Williams will play before she puts her rackets away for good, and the 40-year-old American exited the National Bank Open on Wednesday night with a 6-2, 6-4 loss to Belinda Bencic.\n\nWhile there were some familiar fist pumps and yells of “Come on!” during competition, it was only afterward that Williams really allowed her feelings to show, her voice shaking and her eyes welling during an on-court interview when Bencic ceded the spotlight.\n\n“A lot of emotions, obviously,” Williams told spectators who offered her encouragement throughout the clear, 75-degree evening.\n\nThe second-round match at the hard-court tuneup for the U.S. Open came a day after she announced “the countdown has begun” on her playing career, saying she wants to have another child and pursue business interests.\n\nShe did not state precisely what her last event will be, but did make it sound as if her final farewell will come at the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 29 in New York. Williams has won the singles title at Flushing Meadows a half-dozen times — first in 1999; most recently in 2014 — to go along with seven championships apiece at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, plus three at the French Open.\n\n“It’s been a pretty interesting 24 hours,” Williams said after Wednesday’s match.\n\n“I’m terrible at goodbyes,” she added, her hand on her chest, “but goodbye, Toronto!”\n\nNext up on her schedule is the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati next week, another event that serves as preparation for the year's last Grand Slam tournament.\n\nWilliams, a three-time champion in Canada, started this match, fittingly enough, with an ace. Delivered another later in that game, too, showing off the superb serve that helped her to so many match victories, so many tournament titles, so many weeks at No. 1 in the rankings.\n\nThat elite ability showed up occasionally against Bencic, whether the trio of unreturnable serves to close out that opening game or a later putaway swinging volley accented with a shout and a tug on the brim of her white visor.\n\nBut because of a leg injury that sidelined her for the last half of 2021 and first half of 2022, she was playing for only the third time in the past 12 months. There were signs of that, as well, and of why Williams is no longer the dominant force she was for so long.\n\nThe breaks of her serve that were never quite so frequent when she was younger and at the height of her powers. The not-quite-on-target groundstrokes. The inability to offer up too much resistance while receiving serve; she only earned one break point in the first set, missing a return long to fritter away that chance, and none in the second.\n\n“I wish I could have played better,” Williams said, “but Belinda played so well today.”\n\nIt did not help Williams that she was facing an opponent 15 years her junior and quite talented, to boot: Bencic is ranked 12th, won a gold medal for Switzerland at the Tokyo Olympics last year and has been a Grand Slam semifinalist.\n\n“It's always an honor to be on the court with her,” Bencic said, “and that's why I think tonight is about her.”\n\nBencic took home the Toronto trophy at age 18 in 2015, when she eliminated Williams in the semifinals to earn the distinction of being the youngest woman to beat a player many consider, as one homemade poster in the stands declared Wednesday, the “GOAT” — the greatest of all-time.\n\nIn the late match, Bianca Andreescu — the final Canadian left in the singles draw — beat Alize Cornet 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Andreescu won the tournament in 2019 when Williams retired in the final match because of back problems.\n\nBencic advanced to face two-time major champion Garbiñe Muguruza, who beat Kaia Kanepi 6-4, 6-4. Seeded players who left the draw Wednesday included No. 2 Anett Kontaveit, No. 4 Paula Badosa, No. 5 Ons Jabeur, No. 13 Leylah Fernandez and No. 16 Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nJabeur, the Wimbledon runner-up last month, stopped in the second set against Zheng Qinwen because of abdominal pain. Badosa cited muscle cramping for her mid-match retirement while trailing Yulia Putintseva.\n\nFernandez, the Canadian who was the U.S. Open runner-up last year, lost 7-6 (4), 6-1 to Beatriz Haddad Maia, while Alison Riske-Amritraj defeated 2017 French Open champion Ostapenko 7-6 (2), 0-6, 7-5.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/07/10/could-wimbledon-champ-rybakina-join-swiatek-osaka-at-top/50472931/", "title": "Could Wimbledon champ Rybakina join Swiatek, Osaka at top?", "text": "AP\n\nWIMBLEDON, England (AP) — With Serena Williams nearing the end of her career and Ash Barty newly in retirement, Elena Rybakina served her way right into the Wimbledon void.\n\nWith some consistency at the biggest tournaments, tennis might just have a new rival for Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka on the women's tour.\n\nThe 23-year-old Rybakina won her first major title at Wimbledon on Saturday — in only her second appearance at the All England Club. She beat Ons Jabeur, another player with the capability of spending a long time at the top of the game, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 on Centre Court.\n\n“I think just now (the) generation is changing a bit and (there are) so many young players,” Rybakina told a roundtable of five journalists. \"But I’m pretty sure that in (a) few years, just one player, two, three are going to dominate.\n\n“For now it was Iga with the great strikes. I think she was playing unbelievable. I think also now she’s going to keep doing well. So I don’t know, maybe it’s going to change. Maybe it’s going to be someone new every week.”\n\nSwiatek was upset in the third round at this year's tournament, ending a 37-match winning streak — only a few weeks after earning her second French Open title.\n\nWilliams went out even earlier. The 23-time Grand Slam champion, who is 40 and owns seven titles at the All England Club, lost in the first round. It was her first singles match since stopping in the first round last year because of injury.\n\nThe reigning champion until Saturday was Barty. But she retired soon after winning this year's Australian Open. She was only 25 years old at the time.\n\nAll that makes Rybakina one of the early favorites for the U.S. Open, the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament of the season.\n\n“I didn't really think yet about the U.S. Open and the next tournaments,” Rybakina said. \"But I don't know, so many good players and different players just won Grand Slams in the past so I really don't know how I'm going to feel there.\n\n“But for sure I think I'm coming there more confident.”\n\nShe should have an abundance of that. At Wimbledon, Rybakina led the tournament with 53 aces, almost twice as many as Caroline Garcia in second place with 30.\n\nAnd she used that serve to get out of trouble late in the match against Jabeur after dropping only her second set of the fortnight at the start of the day.\n\nAt 3-2 in the deciding set, Jabeur held three break points at love-40 and was close to getting back on serve.\n\n“I knew I have this big weapon, serve, but it didn’t work out for the whole first set. And Ons, she was using the serve very well,” Rybakina said in her post-match news conference. “I was just thinking that I need these big serves right now because if not, it’s going to be very tough to replay again.”\n\nShe got them, and she held. Jabeur didn't win another game.\n\n“I think she’s one of the best from the young generation,” Jabeur said. “I don’t know how old she is, but she’s really young, I think. She really plays good.”\n\nBesides her play on the grass, Rybakina has also had to answer questions about her nationality. She was born in Russia but switched to play for Kazakhstan in 2018.\n\nSwitching allegiances isn't normally controversial, but the topic has come up several times this year after Russian and Belarusian players were banned from Wimbledon because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRybakina called her decision to play for another country “perfect timing.”\n\n“I would say I’m lucky in this because Kazakhstan federation, they were looking at the same time for (a) player to help,\" Rybakina said, \"and they believed in me, so I think I was just lucky in that moment and we just found each other like this.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP Wimbledon coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/wimbledon and https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2022/08/09/serena-williams-says-she-is-evolving-away-from-tennis/50579759/", "title": "Serena Williams says 'countdown has begun' to retirement", "text": "AP\n\nSaying “the countdown has begun,” 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams announced Tuesday she is ready to step away from tennis so she can turn her focus to having another child and her business interests, presaging the end of a career that transcended sports.\n\nIn an essay released Tuesday by Vogue magazine, and a post on Instagram — the sorts of direct-to-fans communication favored these days by celebrities, a category she most definitely fits — Williams was not completely clear on the timeline for her last match, but she made it sound as if that could be at the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 29 in New York.\n\n“There comes a time in life when we have to decide to move in a different direction. That time is always hard when you love something so much. My goodness do I enjoy tennis. But now, the countdown has begun,” Williams, who turns 41 next month, wrote on Instagram. “I have to focus on being a mom, my spiritual goals and finally discovering a different, but just (as) exciting Serena. I’m gonna relish these next few weeks.”\n\nWilliams, one of the greatest and most accomplished athletes in the history of her — or any other — sport, wrote in the essay that she does not like the word “retirement” and prefers to think of this stage of her life as “evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”\n\n“I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads,” she wrote. “I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next.”\n\nThat she would be publicly contemplating the end of her playing days is not all that surprising, given her age — her 10 Grand Slam titles after turning 30 are unsurpassed — her history of injuries and her recent record: one victory in a singles match in the past 12 months (that win arrived Monday in Toronto; she is scheduled to play again on Wednesday).\n\n“Serena Williams is a generational, if not multigenerational, talent who had a profound impact on the game of tennis, but an even greater influence on women in sports, business and society. At a time when our nation and the world have wrestled with essential issues of identity, Serena has stood as a singular exemplar of the best of humanity after breaking through countless barriers to her participation and ultimate success,” U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said. “She leaves an indelible legacy of grace and grit that will inspire athletes, female and male, for many generations to come. We can’t thank her enough for all she has done for our sport.”\n\nWilliams' status as an athlete, and a groundbreaker, is obvious to everyone.\n\nShe was the first Black woman since Althea Gibson in 1958 to win a Grand Slam title; Williams and her older sister, seven-time major singles champion Venus, helped broaden the sport's audience and attract new players.\n\n“I grew up watching her. I mean, that’s the reason why I play tennis,” Coco Gauff, an 18-year-old African-American who was the runner-up at this year’s French Open, said Tuesday. “Tennis being a predominantly white sport, it definitely helped a lot, because I saw somebody who looked like me dominating the game. And it made me believe that I could dominate, too.”\n\nU.S. Tennis Association spokesman Chris Widmaier said the organization would “be operating under the assumption that this will be Serena Williams' last U.S. Open.”\n\nIt is the year’s final Grand Slam event and one she has won six times, most recently in 2014, to go along with seven titles apiece at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, plus three at the French Open, across a career remarkable for its peaks and its longevity.\n\nShe also owns 14 Grand Slam doubles championships, all won with Venus, part of a remarkable tale of two siblings from Compton, California, both of whom grew up to be ranked No. 1, win dozens of trophies and dominate tennis for stretches — a story told in the Oscar-winning film “King Richard.”\n\nVenus, who is 42 and still competing, was the first in the family to break through, reaching her first Grand Slam final at the 1997 U.S. Open. But it was Serena who soon surpassed her sister, winning the 1999 U.S. Open at age 17 and then going on to add 22 more such triumphs (Venus won seven major singles titles), eventually establishing herself as a one-of-a-kind superstar, known for far more than her talent with a racket in hand.\n\nThe younger Williams was armed with as effective a serve as there’s ever been, powerful forehands and backhands, instincts and speed that allowed her to cover every inch of a court and switch from defense to offense in a blink, and an enviable will to win. That unflinching desire to be the best helped make her the best — and also sometimes got her into trouble with chair umpires during matches, most infamously during the 2018 U.S. Open final she lost to Naomi Osaka, a woman more than a decade younger who grew up idolizing Williams, as have so many of today's players.\n\nThe official Twitter feed for Wimbledon posted this message Tuesday above a photo of Williams: “Some play the game. Others change it.”\n\n“I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court,” Williams wrote. “They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all.”\n\nThe American has won more Grand Slam singles titles in the professional era than any other woman or man. Only one player, Margaret Court, collected more, 24, although the Australian won a portion of hers in the amateur era.\n\n“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a Grand Slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record,” Williams said. “Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus Grand Slams.”\n\nBut, Williams went on to write, “These days, if I have to choose between building my tennis resume and building my family, I choose the latter.”\n\nShe and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, have a daughter, Olympia, who turns 5 on Sept. 1.\n\n“Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair,” said Williams, who was pregnant when she won the 2017 Australian Open for her last Grand Slam trophy. “If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.”\n\nWilliams said she and Ohanian want to have a second baby, and wrote: “I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.”\n\nShe was off the tour for about a year after getting injured during her first-round match at Wimbledon in 2021. She returned to singles competition at the All England Club this June and lost in the first round.\n\n“Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York,\" Williams wrote in her essay. “But I’m going to try.”\n\nWilliams hinted in the Vogue essay that the U.S. Open would be her last tournament but did not say so explicitly.\n\n“I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment,” Williams wrote. “I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2019/07/17/sports-athletes-tom-brady-serena-williams-tiger-woods-nolan-ryan/1433381001/", "title": "Top 16 athletes over 35 of all-time: From Tom Brady to Serena ...", "text": "The prime of professional athletes' careers doesn't last forever, but there are many examples of those who have defied age and performed well later in their careers.\n\nHere's a look at 16 of some of the most successful athletes who have evaded the tolls of Father Time by thriving since turning 35 (in no particular order):\n\nTom Brady, 41 — active. The New England Patriots quarterback has six Super Bowl rings, including last season — another Pro Bowl campaign. Brady's a surefire Hall of Famer and will be in the debate for the best ever based on both success (he's a four-time Super Bowl MVP, three-time season MVP) and durability (2019 will be his 20th season). But his playoff success in the latter stages of his career stands out, starting with the fact that he has played in more Super Bowls (nine) than road playoff games (seven). According to Pro Football Reference, Brady's statistics since turning 35 would still rank him fourth all-time in playoff passing yards (5,284), sixth in playoff touchdowns (34) and ninth in player passer rating (95.3). Not bad for a sixth-round pick.\n\n'BETTER LATE THAN NEVER':Phoenix man tries college football at 37\n\nMAKE IT HAPPEN:Five deals we want to done before MLB trading deadline\n\nTiger Woods, 43 — active. The 15-time major golf champ is widely regarded as one of the best golfers — and athletes — of the generation. After bursting onto the scene in the late 1990s (winning the 1997 Masters by a record 12 strokes), Woods remained a dominant force by winning 13 major championships stretching into his 30s. While personal and health struggles kept Woods without a major title for the early part of this decade, he punctuated a comeback from back surgery by winning the 2019 Masters — fist-pumping like he did in his 20s and showing optimism for his 40s.\n\nSerena Williams, 37 — active. The 23-time Grand Slam tennis champ has gone on a majors drought since her daughter was born in 2017 after her Australian Open title (while eight weeks pregnant). But she's been in three finals since — in the 2018 U.S. Open, plus Wimbledon the last two years — and remains the top name in major tournaments. While Williams' career achievements have come early and in the middle of her career, she'd been at her most dominant form well into her 30s — winning four consecutive majors (the 2014 U.S. Open, 2015 Australian Open, 2015 French Open and 2015 Wimbledon).\n\nJaromir Jagr, age 47 — active. The right wing played in the NHL until 2018, spanning a three-decade-plus long career in the league and overseas that began in 1990. He has the second most points in NHL history and became the oldest to record a hat trick in 2015 while playing at a high level into his 40s. He's still playing in the Czech Republic Hockey League.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, retired age 43. The Hall of Fame big man known for his skyhook and goggles won four of his six career NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers after he turned 35. He played at an All-Star level right up until his retirement. He was Finals MVP in '85 at age 38 and first-team All-NBA in '86 at 39.\n\nBarry Bonds, retired age 43. Bonds won four consecutive MVP awards from 2001-04 — all in his late 30s — and went on to become the oldest player to win the NL batting title at 38 in 2002. Significant circumstantial evidence tying Bonds to the BALCO doping scandal is for now keeping him out of the Hall of Fame.\n\nRoger Federer, 37 — active. Federer's tennis legacy will be tied to both greatness and longevity. The 20-time Grand Slam tennis champ (the record holder for men's players) is ahead of current tennis juggernauts Rafael Nadal (18) and Novak Djokovic (16) in majors but perhaps most impressive about Federer's career has been his ability to challenge both those players in semifinals and championships — and stay right behind them in ATP rankings. In his prime, Federer was the world No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks, a stretch in which he achieved the coveted Career Grand Slam. His epic five-set tiebreaker loss to Djokovic in the Wimbledon final this month will sting, but the performance also encapsulates Federer's redefining of an age barrier in the sport.\n\nBabe Didrikson Zaharias, died at 45. Before the renowned golfer died of cancer in 1956, she was still at the top of her game and atop the LPGA Tour. She won the U.S. Open, her 10th and final career major, by 12 strokes at age 43 in 1954. A two-time gold medalist in track and field at the 1932 Olympics, she is considered one of the best female athletes of all-time.\n\nJack Nicklaus, retired age 65. The golfing legend won six of his record 18 major championships after 35, including the 1986 Masters when a 46-year-old Nicklaus became the oldest winner in the tournament's history.\n\nGordie Howe, retired age 52. He earned his 20th and 21st NHL All-Star selections after turning 39 and made his final NHL appearance in his 50s. The former MVP spearheaded the Detroit Red Wings to four Stanley Cup titles in his 26-season career and topped 90 points four times when he came out of retirement to play alongside his sons in the World Hockey Association.\n\nBernard Hopkins, retired age 51. Nicknamed \"The Executioner,\" Hopkins was known for his longevity and productivity at an older age. Hopkins became the oldest world champion ever when he beat Jean Pascal at 46 for the WBC light heavyweight title. Then, at 49, he beat Beibut Shumenov in a split decision for the WBA and IBF light heavyweight titles.\n\nMartina Navratilova, retired age 49. Revered for her prowess on the singles (18 Grand Slams) and doubles (31 Grand Slams) courts in the 1980s and early '90s, Navratilova un-retired in 2000 to punctuate her career. She went on to win 12 more doubles titles and three more mixed doubles Grand Slams. That puts her total mark at 59 Grand Slams. Navratilova also won a singles match in the first round of Wimbledon in 2004 at age 47 — making her the oldest player to win a Grand Slam singles match in the open era.\n\nSatchel Paige, retired age 48. Paige became the oldest rookie in MLB history at 42 after the league was desegregated. He brought more than two decades of experience and prowess from the Negro Leagues. He pitched for 40 years in all and went 28-31 with a 3.31 ERA in five MLB seasons with the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Browns. In 1965, at age 59, he pitched three innings and gave up one hit in a return game with the Kansas City Athletics.\n\nNolan Ryan, retired age 46. Ryan led the league in strikeouts for four consecutive years, the last of which was when he was 43. He also had two of his record seven career no-hitters after 43.\n\nGeorge Blanda, retired age 48. Blanda played 26 seasons of pro football in the AFL and NFL over the course of four decades from 1949-1975. The former quarterback and placekicker retired in 1976 as the oldest to play at 48. He topped 3,000 passing yards after age 36 and 37 and made 62.7% of his field-goal attempts after turning 40.\n\nDara Torres, retired age 45. The American swimmer made multiple comebacks in her career. She returned to the pool for the 2000 Olympics after seven years out of competitive swimming and then again at the 2008 Games — where she became the oldest U.S. Olympic swimmer in history at age 41 and the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008). In U.S. trials for the 2008 Beijing Games, she set an American record for the 50-meter freestyle, then won silver in the 50-meter freestyle, 4×100-meter medley relay, and 4×100-meter freestyle relay at that Olympics.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nGeorge Foreman, Gaylord Perry, Phil Mickelson, Roger Clemens, Phil Niekro, Pete Rose, Hank Aaron, Randy Johnson, Bartolo Colon, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, Jerry Rice, Adam Vinatieri, John Stockton, Chris Chelios, Kerri Walsh Jennings, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2020/01/01/atp-cup-adds-to-crowded-tennis-dates-before-australian-open/40927075/", "title": "ATP Cup adds to crowded tennis dates before Australian Open", "text": "AP\n\nRoger Federer won't be playing until the Australian Open, but the the summer of tennis Down Under ahead of the first Grand Slam of 2020 will be a little more hectic for everybody else.\n\nKicking off on Friday with the start of the new 24-team, Davis Cup-style ATP Cup in three cities across Australia, players will have a host of options to them on both the ATP and WTA tours.\n\nFederer and Switzerland aren't involved in the ATP Cup, but No. 1-ranked Rafael Nadal and No. 2 Novak Djokovic will be representing Spain and Serbia, respectively. No. 3 Federer wants to spend more time with his family before the start of the Australian Open on Jan. 20 in Melbourne.\n\nWhen the ATP Cup concludes on Jan. 12, Djokovic is scheduled to play at the Adelaide International, a joint ATP-WTA tournament that includes world No. 1 women's player Ash Barty of Australia. Also in that week across the Tasman Sea in New Zealand will be the ATP's Auckland Open.\n\nThe Brisbane International, formerly a joint ATP-WTA event, will be a women's only tournament this year with hometown star Barty among a group of headliners also including Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka, beginning next Monday.\n\nVenus Williams, who had been given a wild card for Brisbane, pulled out with an undisclosed training “setback”on Wednesday. She still hopes to play in Adelaide.\n\nAlso on the WTA Tour, the ASB Classic next week has secured a bit of a coup with Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki, who will retire after the Australian Open, scheduled to attend and play singles as well as doubles together in New Zealand. The Hobart International will be played the same week in Australia.\n\nThe 38-year-old Federer, who has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles, is the only one of the top seven players in the men's rankings who will not be competing in the 10-day ATP Cup in Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.\n\n\"He's made the decision to spend some time with his family and he's obviously a lot more conscious of how much he's playing (as he gets older),\" ATP Cup tournament director Tom Larner told the Australian Associated Press. \"For everything Roger has given to the sport we're accepting of that.\"\n\nAndy Murray will not be appearing for Britain, withdrawing following an injury setback after his return from hip surgery.\n\nAustralia will play in Brisbane with Germany, Greece and Canada. In the other Brisbane group it's Serbia, France, South Africa and Chile. In Sydney, Belgium, Britain, Bulgaria and Molodova comprise one group while the other contains Argentina, Austria, Croatia and Poland. Perth hosts the United States, Russia, Italy and Norway and another group comprising Spain, Japan, Uruguay and Georgia.\n\nKei Nishikori withdrew from the Japan team for the ATP Cup and from the Australian Open.\n\n\"I am still not 100% ready to compete at the highest level,\" Nishikori said. He has not competed since the U.S. Open because of a right elbow injury that required surgery in October.\n\nThere are a number of innovations to be provided at the ATP Cup, including Team Zones, which will replace the player chairs near the umpire, and on-court coaching where the captain, coaches and players can offer input.\n\nEach encounter will be best-of-three, three-set matches — two singles and a doubles. The six group winners plus two second-place countries go through to the final series in Sydney beginning Jan. 9.\n\nWorld No. 15-ranked Denis Shapovalov, a member of the Canadian team which opens against Greece on Friday, questioned the timing of the ATP Cup so close to last year's new format for the Davis Cup, the long-standing men's international team competition. On Nov. 24, Nadal beat Shapovalov to clinch the Davis Cup for Spain in Madrid.\n\nThe 20-year-old Shapovalov said ideally there would be only one \"world championship\" of tennis.\n\n“I think it is a little bit strange to have it at a similar time as Davis Cup,” he said. “It would be great just to have one event that is a world championship. It is a weird feeling playing a world championships then coming into another event that is pretty much the same thing. We will see how it pans out.”\n\nThere's no question in Nadal's mind about his objective for the new event.\n\n“It's a tournament that we want to compete well in, and then we'll have a week before the Australian Open for me personally to practice and for some of the others to play in Auckland or Adelaide,” he said. \"So we are very focused on trying to be ready for this competition.\n\n“We are a team that gives the maximum.”\n\nTo add some extra appeal at the Auckland WTA event, longtime friends Serena Williams and Wozniacki will play doubles together for the first time. Former No. 1 Wozniacki who has started her season in Auckland every year since 2015, has made the hardcourt tournament the first stop of her short farewell tour.\n\nThe 29-year-old Wozniacki was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis shortly after she won the 2018 Australian Open and will retire from tennis after playing at Melbourne Park this month.\n\nWilliams, a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion and who was recently named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade, has not played doubles with anyone other than her sister, Venus, since the Fed Cup World Group playoff in 2015. Her last WTA tournament in doubles without Venus was in 2002.\n\nBy the time the weekend of Feb. 1 and 2 rolls around — the finals of the women's and men's singles championship at the Australian Open — the victors may not have been the ones who played best during the two weeks at Melbourne Park, but those who best managed the fast-paced tournament schedule leading up to it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/tennis/serena-williams-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Serena Williams begins farewell tour as she loses at the Canadian ...", "text": "(CNN) Carrying a bouquet of flowers and wiping a tear from her eye, Serena Williams waved to the raucous crowd on Wednesday a day after her announcing her forthcoming retirement from tennis.\n\nThe 23-time grand slam champion was defeated 6-2 6-4 by Belinda Bencic in the second round of the Canadian Open in Toronto -- her first match since penning an article in Vogue explaining that \"the countdown has begun\" and that she will \"evolve away from tennis.\"\n\n\"As I said in the article, I'm terrible at goodbyes.

Guerrillas have repeatedly tried to kill Vladimir Saldo, head of the Kherson region's Russia-backed temporary administration. His assistant, Pavel Slobodchikov, was shot and killed in his vehicle, and another official, Dmytry Savluchenko, was killed by a car bomb.\n\n“The Russians were expecting that they would be met with flowers, but they faced the fact that most people consider themselves Ukrainians and are ready to offer resistance,” said Oleksii Aleksandrov, a businessman in the occupied southern port of Mariupol.\n\nRussia says UN pulled plug on planned visit to nuclear plant\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow agreed to an International Atomic Energy Agency visit to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, on June 3, but the trip was canceled by U.N. officials because of security concerns. The U.N. and IAEA officials have warned that bombing around the plant could lead to a nuclear disaster and have urged the combatants to allow an IAEA team into the plant.\n\nEach sides has blamed the other for rocket attacks at the Russian-occupied plant.\n\n\"For our part, we are ready to provide the maximum possible assistance in resolving all organizational issues,\" the foreign ministry statement said.\n\nRussia's old mines 'unreliable and unpredictable'\n\nIt is “highly likely” that Russia is deploying Soviet-era mines along its defensive lines in the eastern Donbas region, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Monday.

Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe world is drowning in trash, and the waste generation rates are only increasing, according to the World Bank. Due to population growth and urban areas growth, the amount of trash countries produce is only expected to rise – by some estimates as much as 70% between 2016 and 2050.\n\nWhile much of the focus is on individuals and families and the amount of trash they generate, residential trash is only a fraction of the garbage produced by certain industries.\n\nMunicipal solid waste management (MSW), which is waste generated from companies, buildings, institutions, small businesses, houses, and yards, often comprises less than 5% of the total amount of waste produced in a country.\n\nBetween 30% and 35% of the total amount of generated waste in most developed countries is attributed to building sector activities such as building construction, renovation, and demolition processes, according to the official EU statistical data.\n\nIn many countries on our list, the construction industry is often the largest culprit, generating more than 90% of the total waste produced in a country. China is a notable exception, where more than half of the waste is agricultural or industrial.\n\nMany countries have recognized the importance of properly and safely disposing of trash and have passed laws regulating how cities and corporations source and get rid of the waste they are producing. Some developing countries are struggling because governments often lack the funding to solve waste management challenges. Many are focusing on advocating recycling. In the United States, for example, some states will even pay you to recycle.\n\nTo identify the largest producers of waste, 24/7 Tempo calculated the special waste and regular municipal solid waste per capita produced by each country, using data from the World Bank’s “What a Waste” global database, last updated in September of 2018. We summed for each country the metric tons (or tonnes) of waste in the latest year for which data was available in the special categories of agricultural waste, construction and demolition, e waste, hazardous waste, industrial waste, medical waste, and the total municipal solid waste (msw).\n\nA car for Nazis and hippies alike:Say goodbye to the Volkswagen Beetle\n\n10. Serbia\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 8.9 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 62,269,603 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 0.8%\n\n• Population: 7,020,858\n\nSimilar to other countries on the list, Serbia also generates a large amount of construction industry waste – over 46 million metric tons of the 62 million metric tons of total waste.\n\nThe residential construction industry in Serbia has been booming over the last several years. Permits are being issued in record numbers. The huge amount of construction and demolition waste may be partially explained by a law that requires 70% of construction material and built-in equipment to be made in Serbia. Regulation and individual initiatives to properly manage construction waste are both lacking. This has resulted in construction waste going directly to municipal landfills without sorting.\n\n9. Ukraine\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 10.6 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 474,106,025 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 3.2%\n\n• Population: 44,831,135\n\nUkraine, one of the biggest arms dealers in the world, generates just over 474 million metric tons of waste a year, 448 million of which is hazardous waste. No other of the 105 countries for which data on hazardous waste is available produces more such waste. The government has recognized hazardous waste management as the most urgent and critical issue that needs to be addressed in waste management in general. Lack of financing has been identified as a major reason for the lack of initiatives in the field.\n\nMost of the other 26 million metric tons of waste in Ukraine is municipal solid waste and agricultural waste, which includes garbage produced in farms, poultry and slaughterhouses, harvest waste, fertilizer run-off from fields, and pesticides.\n\n8. Luxembourg\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 11.8 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 7,016,503 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 28.4%\n\n• Population: 596,336\n\nLuxembourg, a tiny nation of about 600,000 people, produced slightly more than 7 million tonnes of waste in 2017, but only a fraction of it was municipal solid waste. This kind of waste consists of products homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals throw out, such as appliances, clothes, bottles, food, and paper.\n\nThe other 90.0% of the garbage was mostly construction and demolition waste. The construction industry in Luxembourg has fared better than many other EU countries since the recession because of its overall strong economy. The number of building companies, as well as building permits, increased between 2008 and 2013. Investment in construction grew by 8.6% after rebounding from the housing crisis. Part of the demand may be explained by the growing tourism industry. Luxembourg is among the most tourism-friendly countries in the world.\n\n7. Sweden\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 16.2 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 163,199,471 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 32.4%\n\n• Population: 10,057,698\n\nSweden, one of the happiest countries in the world, generates about 163 million tonnes of waste a year, the 15th most of the 178 countries for which data is available. But only a small fraction of that – about 2.6% – is municipal solid waste, while about 93% of the garbage is construction and demolition waste. The rest is mostly medical and hazardous waste.\n\nThough Sweden is among the countries producing the most waste, largely due to the large amount of construction waste, the nation has made improvements in recycling this waste. This kind of waste has been prioritized in the national waste plan and in its waste prevention program.\n\n6. Armenia\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 16.3 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 47,889,000 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: N/A\n\n• Population: 2,930,450\n\nArmenia produces relatively little municipal waste, with nearly 493,000 tons in 2014. It also ranks among the countries producing the least amount of agricultural and construction waste. However, what contributes to Armenia’s rank among the world's biggest producers of waste is the huge amount of industrial waste it produces. Of the nearly 48 million tons of total waste the country produces, 47.3 million is industrial.\n\nArmenia does not have processing plants or specialized sites to treat and bury waste, partly explaining its waste problem. Its first solid waste landfill has been in the making since 2011. The country’s garbage is currently being disposed of at uncontrolled dumpsites from which toxins escape into the air in the form of methane gas.\n\nTech heavyweights fight:Amazon, Microsoft wage war over $10 billion opportunity with the Pentagon\n\n5. Finland\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 16.6 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 91,698,449 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 28.1%\n\n• Population: 5,508,214\n\nJust about 3.0% of the total waste produced in Finland is municipal waste. Almost half of it is burned, a trend that has only been improving over the last several years. Recycling has also been increasing because it's a highly advocated method of waste management in the country and in Europe in general.\n\nThe other 97.0% of waste generated in the country comes from various industries, but mostly construction. The housing sector in Finland, one of the richest countries in the world, has been growing due to low mortgage rates and expanding urban areas, resulting in an increased demand for new buildings, especially with small apartments in centrally located zones.\n\n4. Estonia\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 23.5 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 30,912,409 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 24.7%\n\n• Population: 1,317,384\n\nEstonia, a rising tourism destination where tourists sometimes outnumber locals, produces a total amount of nearly 31 million metric tons of garbage, and a third of that is hazardous waste. The country generates more than 35 times the EU average of hazardous waste per capita, with almost all of it coming from the oil shale sector. Ash and other waste from combusting and refining ends up in landfill, polluting the air with toxic substances.\n\nThe country has set regulations for discharging of hazardous waste with taxes imposed if such waste is dumped into water, but payment of these taxes is not strictly enforced, resulting in weak incentive for companies to reduce their environmental footprint, according to the OECD.\n\nHouse hunting? The housing market is about to shift in a bad way for buyers\n\n3. United States\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 25.9 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 8,425,840,000 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 34.6%\n\n• Population: 325,147,121\n\nThe United States, with the third-largest population of all countries, produced the most municipal solid waste in the world – 258 million tonnes of MSW was generated in 2017. By contrast, second-place China generated 210 million tonnes of MSW in 2017. Adding to this total the World Bank's special waste categories of industrial, medical, E waste, hazardous, and agricultural waste, the U.S. generates approximately 8.4 billion tonnes of waste in a year.\n\nWhile the U.S. is the third biggest producer of waste on a per capita basis, some areas within the country are making strides addressing the problem. For example, San Francisco passed an ordinance in 2009 requiring all residents and tourists to compost food waste. The city turned more than a million tonnes of food waste into compost, and as of 2012 had achieved nearly 80% waste diversion – the highest rate of any major U.S. city in the United States. Local government are raising awareness about recycling. Some state now will even pay residents to recycle.\n\n2. Bulgaria\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 26.7 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 189,141,945 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 19.0%\n\n• Population: 7,075,947\n\nBulgaria, a country of about 7 million people, generates slightly more garbage per person as the United States, a country of more than 325 million people. This is largely due to the more than 172 million metric tons of waste produced by the construction industry, the fifth highest amount of the 68 countries for which construction and demolition waste data is available.\n\nAfter an economic slowdown that resulted from the global recession, the construction business is picking up again. Real estate construction has seen the greatest increase in activity – 16.4% between 2010 and 2016. While Bulgaria seems on track to produce even more waste, it is among the countries doing the most to minimize its effect on the environment.\n\nUber Comfort:You can now request more legroom and less conversation in Uber rides\n\n1. Canada\n\n• Estimated annual waste per capita: 36.1 metric tons\n\n• Estimated annual waste total: 1,325,480,289 metric tons\n\n• Waste treatment recycling: 20.6%\n\n• Population: 36,708,083\n\nDriven by agricultural waste and industrial waste generation, which totaled 181 million tonnes and 1.12 billion tonnes, respectively, in 2017, Canada's estimated total waste generation is the highest in the world. Canada produced 1.33 billion metric tonnes of waste, or 36.1 tonnes per person.\n\nAccording to the Canadian government, waste from industrial activities such as oil refining, chemical manufacturing, and metal processing contains various hazardous chemicals, including acids, phenols, arsenic, lead, and mercury. Industrial waste generation is a long-standing problem in Canada, which sought to address the issue as early as 1992 when it ratified the Basel Convention. Like many affluent nations, Canada exports large portions of its waste to other countries, and the convention controls and aims at reducing these waste shipments. This and other measures put Canada on the list of countries doing the most to protect the environment.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Several crises, from the coronavirus pandemic to a polarized public – have serious consequences for journalism and global press freedom.\n\nProsperous nations, which include some of the largest and oldest elected democracies in the world, tend to have greater press freedom than poorer countries. But this trend is far from consistent. The 50 richest countries in the world based on GDP per capita rank anywhere from best in the world, to among the worst 10 countries for freedom of the press.\n\nTo compare press freedom in the world’s richest countries, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2020 World Press Freedom Index scores in the 50 countries with the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In its annual press freedom index, the non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) measures freedom of information throughout the world by combining survey-responses of media experts, as well as counts of acts of violence against journalists.\n\nElected leaders in many democracies, which are known for having free and independent media, have tried to silence critical outlets and promote those that offer favorable coverage. Even the president of the United States, one of the oldest democracies and a country famous for its fierce defense of its First Amendment that guarantees freedom of the press, has frequently demonized the news media as the “enemy of the people.” His rhetoric has given succor to political leaders in other countries who have passed bills making “fake news” illegal, and have framed articles they don’t like as bogus news.\n\nWhen it comes to press freedom, one region stands out. Scandinavian countries continue to lead the world, and western Europe media remains mostly free despite a few wobbles. These two regions lead the way in another important area – these are countries that have come closest to true gender equality.\n\nAsk HR:Can my employer require drug tests?\n\nHomeschooling budget:Homeschool pods are gaining traction amid worries about school reopening\n\n50.

The government has broad powers to shut down news outlets and websites and revoke licenses. Journalists are frequently harassed in the sultanate of 4 million people, and they can be arrested and detained incommunicado for charges such as insulting government authorities or trying to disrupt civil order. In 2016, two independent newspapers were shuttered or had operations suspended by the government.\n\n49. Russia\n\n• Population: 144,373,535\n\n• GDP per capita: $29,181\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 48.9 – 149th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 50.3 – 149th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nRussia has one of the worst free press ratings in the world. Since anti-government protests in 2011 and 2012, free press has been stifled by website blocking and selectively applied laws that have landed journalists in prison. Meanwhile, television in the country pushes propaganda and is hostile towards members of the press trying to do their job fairly. Major TV networks in Russia are either state-run or managed by companies with close government ties.\n\n48. Malaysia\n\n• Population: 31,949,777\n\n• GDP per capita: $29,526\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 33.1 – 101st out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 36.7 – 123rd out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nPress freedom began to improve in Malaysia in 2018 after the ruling coalition Barisan Nasional was defeated after governing the Asian nation since 1957. The new government began easing laws and regulations that restricted the press, and the media are now offering more diverse coverage. The government is taking steps to end the Anti-Fake News Act, which the former government had adopted in April 2018. Even so, legislation such as the Sedition Act, the Official Secrets Act, and the Communications and Multimedia Act that have been used to suppress the press and regulate publication licenses, remains on the books.\n\n47. Croatia\n\n• Population: 4,067,500\n\n• GDP per capita: $29,973\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.5 – 59th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.0 – 64th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nAlthough Croatia's score and ranking in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index has improved slightly since last year, the country's situation for journalists remains \"problematic,\" according to RSF. The media enjoy a relatively high degree of independence, but investigative journalists, especially those looking into corruption, organized crime, or war crimes, are often targeted. It's illegal to publish \"humiliating\" content, as well as to insult the republic, flag, or national anthem.\n\nCroatian radio-TV, HRT, owned by the state, is financed by advertising and a license fee. However, officials often meddle in how it's run. Journalists who voice their objections are often sued.\n\n46. Seychelles\n\n• Population: 97,625\n\n• GDP per capita: $30,260\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.7 – 63rd out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.4 – 69th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nMedia independence on the island nation in the Indian Ocean has been hampered by the country's legacy of decades-long communist party rule. The government exercises considerable influence over communications in the Seychelles – the government owns the island's only television station as well as two radio stations. However, a greater diversity of media choices are emerging, though independently owned media tends to be politically slanted. The press exercises self-censorship in regard to controversial national issues in deference to its tourism industry, which is important to the national economy.\n\n45. Greece\n\n• Population: 10,716,322\n\n• GDP per capita: $31,399\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.8 – 65th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.1 – 65th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nFreedom of the press has improved slightly in Greece since last year, although the country still has one of the worst environments for censorship of the media among wealthy nations. Recently, journalists have been attacked and detained by police, and the headquarters of a weekly newspaper was raided by an anarchist group. Additionally, one broadcasting firm and the state news agency were both placed under the supervision of the country's prime minister. Greater media independence and transparency would go a long way to improve press freedom in Greece.\n\n44. Latvia\n\n• Population: 1,912,789\n\n• GDP per capita: $32,204\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 18.6 – 22nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 19.5 – 24th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nMedia outlets in Latvia are allowed to operate freely, face relatively few legal restrictions, and represent a wide range of political views. While Latvia ranks better than most wealthy countries for press freedom, the country is not without some troubling issues. Politicians regularly verbally attack media outlets and the country's public media is woefully underfunded. Latvia's media landscape is also growing less diverse as the country's oldest TV channel was shut down in 2019 and its newsroom merged with another existing channel.\n\n43. Romania\n\n• Population: 19,356,544\n\n• GDP per capita: $32,297\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 25.9 – 48th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 25.7 – 47th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nOut of the 180 nations reviewed by Reporters Without Borders, Romania ranks 48th for press freedom. Unlike many wealthy countries that rank higher, Romania's political and ruling class encourages censorship by pressuring journalists to reveal sources and minimize criticism of leadership. Corruption in the media undercuts journalistic integrity and news outlets often act as a medium for political propaganda.\n\nAlthough Romania's press is considered to be more free than the press in most of the rest of the world, it lags behind most of the 50 wealthy countries on this list.\n\n42. Panama\n\n• Population: 4,246,439\n\n• GDP per capita: $32,762\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 29.8 – 76th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.8 – 79th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nOf all wealthy countries in both North and South America, Panama ranks as having the worst free press. Though most media outlets in the country are privately owned, the government still controls access to information and pressures media companies through allocation of state advertising revenue. Journalists in the country are often fined through defamation cases when they are critical of government policy or cover corruption.\n\nDespite these and other problems, press freedom is far better in Panama than it is in many of its poorer regional neighbors.\n\n41. Hungary\n\n• Population: 9,769,949\n\n• GDP per capita: $33,979\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.8 – 89th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 30.4 – 87th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nHungary's ruling party has tight control over the country's media landscape – which is dominated by a pro-government foundation. Independent journalists in the country are banned from certain events and from asking questions to members of parliament. Generally, politicians who hold power do not give interviews to outlets that are critical of the government. Investigative reporting on government corruption is generally published through online outlets.\n\nGreater media independence and transparency would greatly improve press freedom in Hungary.\n\n40. Slovakia\n\n• Population: 5,454,073\n\n• GDP per capita: $34,178\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.7 – 33rd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 23.6 – 35th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nAs is the case in many of the world's wealthiest countries, press freedom in Slovakia is hampered by government influence and a lack of transparency. In 2018, an investigative journalist was murdered in Slovakia. The killing is believed to have been orchestrated by a businessman who had been surveilling other journalists and had close ties to judges and political figures.\n\nMany major outlets in the country are owned by one of two financial groups – Penta or J&T – and all newspapers are privately owned.\n\n39. Poland\n\n• Population: 37,970,874\n\n• GDP per capita: $34,218\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.7 – 62nd out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 28.9 – 59th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nPoland's constitution protects freedom of expression and forbids censorship. Still, journalists can face up to a year in jail for defamation and this has a chilling effect on independent media outlets in the country.\n\nTVP, one of the three TV networks that dominate the landscape in Poland, is state owned and in 2015, the controlling party introduced a bill that would allow ministers to appoint the network head. The network has effectively become a propaganda machine and non-compliant employees are terminated. In most of the 50 wealthiest countries in the world, the press has more freedom than in Poland.\n\n38. Portugal\n\n• Population: 10,269,417\n\n• GDP per capita: $36,471\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 11.8 – 10th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 12.6 – 12th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nPress freedom – protected under the national constitution – is exemplary in Portugal. Though defamation is illegal in the country, prosecutions are not common. The most outspoken critics of the press in Portugal, unlike much of the rest of the world, are not politicians or the government, but rather soccer clubs that put media outlets in their crosshairs for reporting on potentially unflattering practices.\n\n37. Lithuania\n\n• Population: 2,786,844\n\n• GDP per capita: $38,214\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 21.2 – 28th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.1 – 30th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nFreedom House gives Lithuania a \"free\" assessment in regard to press freedom. The organization says the Baltic country, which was occupied by the Soviet Union until that nation's dissolution in 1991, generally respects freedoms of speech and the press, though some media power brokers try to exercise political influence.\n\nThe media is on guard for attempts by the government to curtail media freedom. In 2019, new legislation permitted the government to suspend radio or television operations if they are considered a threat to the nation's security.\n\n36. Estonia\n\n• Population: 1,326,590\n\n• GDP per capita: $38,811\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.6 – 14th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 12.3 – 11th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nEstonia has one of the best environments for a free press of any country in the world. Unlike some other former Soviet republics, it has not banned rebroadcasting of Russian TV networks – although at the end of 2019, Estonia did force a pro-Russia outlet to close its office in the country, citing EU sanctions on the company's director-general.\n\nThe county's press freedom rating fell slightly from the previous year as right-wing politicians have verbally attacked journalists. Additionally, last year investigative and opinion journalists at the country's oldest newspaper resigned en masse over revelations that the paper's owner was using his position to promote a conservative agenda.\n\n35. Slovenia\n\n• Population: 2,087,946\n\n• GDP per capita: $40,657\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.6 – 32nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.3 – 34th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nFreedom of speech and freedom of the press are constitutionally protected in Slovenia, a nation created out of the former Yugoslavia. However, RSF is concerned about the concentration of media sources and intimidation campaigns against journalists. Defamation is considered a crime in Slovenia and under the Mass Media Act, people who claim to be offended by a story can demand a correction. Journalists can also be legally forced to reveal their sources. State-owned entities hold stakes in media properties, making them susceptible to government interference.\n\n34. Cyprus\n\n• Population: 1,198,575\n\n• GDP per capita: $41,254\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 20.4 – 27th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 21.7 – 28th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Cypriot media are a reflection of the island's political division – the Turkish-controlled zone in the north has its own media outlets. Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the constitution and is generally observed. Politicians, as well as the Orthodox Church, have a lot of influence over the media.\n\nIn March 2020, a pipe bomb exploded in front of the building where outlets owned by the Cypriot news agency MC Digital Media operate. Cyprustimes.com called the explosion an attempt to \"intimidate\" the media.\n\n33. Israel\n\n• Population: 9,053,300\n\n• GDP per capita: $42,194\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.8 – 88th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 30.8 – 88th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nWhile it is a pillar of journalistic freedom in the Middle East, Israel lags behind the vast majority of wealthy countries when it comes to freedom of the press. Media outlets are often banned from covering certain subjects and journalists have been personally targeted by smear campaigns at the behest of politicians and political parties.\n\nFew journalists cover the plight of Palestinians. Two Palestinian journalists were killed by Israeli Defense Force snipers in 2018.\n\n32. Spain\n\n• Population: 47,076,781\n\n• GDP per capita: $42,214\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.2 – 29th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.0 – 29th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nAlthough it lags behind Portugal, its neighbor to the west, Spain has a better freedom-of-the-press rating than most wealthy countries. Still, the media in Spain is increasingly becoming a target of criticism, as a rising political party is crusading against the press by harassing them and barring them from events. In politically divided Catalonia, journalists have been violently assaulted by both separatists and police alike. Investigative journalists are also increasingly targeted, having the protection of their sources overridden by judicial authorities.\n\n31. Czech Republic\n\n• Population: 10,669,709\n\n• GDP per capita: $42,576\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.6 – 40th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 24.9 – 40th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nWhile press freedom is better in the Czech Republic than in most of the rest of the world, the country still faces considerable challenges. Public distrust toward the media is being sown by verbal attacks from elected officials at the highest level. Additionally, the nation's prime minister has considerable media holdings and critics allege that newspapers are becoming a tool for furthering the PM's political interests.\n\nThere are also new concerns in the country that too many media outlets are being concentrated in the hands of a wealthy few, following the 2019 acquisition of a media conglomerate that owns some of the most influential outlets in the country by a Czech billionaire.\n\n30. South Korea\n\n• Population: 51,709,098\n\n• GDP per capita: $43,029\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.7 – 42nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 24.9 – 41st out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Republic of Korea fell more than 30 places in RSF's World Press Freedom Index over a decade. During that time, journalists at two public broadcasters objected to the government selecting their bosses for them. This ended when the Moon administration came to power in 2016, succeeding the government of President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached for corruption. Journalists have been free to report on corruption in South Korea, however, they can be imprisoned for defamation, and the government is especially sensitive about stories involving North Korea.\n\n29. Japan\n\n• Population: 126,264,931\n\n• GDP per capita: $43,236\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 28.9 – 66th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.4 – 67th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nPress freedom in Japan ranks behind the majority of the other richest countries in the world. A law that can put journalists and whistleblowers in prison for a decade for obtaining information in a manner deemed to be illegal has had a chilling effect and contributes to businesses undue influence over the press. Members of the press also frequently complain of a climate of mistrust and a system that discriminates against freelancers and foreign journalists since 2012, when Shinzo Abe was elected prime minister again.\n\nStill, certain newspapers remain trusted and widely circulated in the country.\n\n28. New Zealand\n\n• Population: 4,917,000\n\n• GDP per capita: $43,953\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 10.7 – 9th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 10.8 – 7th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Environment and self-censorship\n\nNew Zealand has been ranked ninth in the latest World Press Freedom Index, falling two places since last year. The report says the country's media is free, but \"its independence and pluralism are often undermined by the profit imperatives of media groups trying to cut costs.\"\n\nConcerns about the Official Information Act have been raised as it prevents journalists from doing their job properly by allowing government agencies to take a long time before responding to information requests and also permitting them to charge for such information.\n\n27. Italy\n\n• Population: 60,297,396\n\n• GDP per capita: $44,197\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.7 – 41st out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 25.0 – 43rd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nAlthough Italy has moved up two spots in the World Press Freedom Index, and the environment in which journalists are working is still \"satisfactory,\" according to the RSF, intimidation against reporters is common. As of 2020, about 20 Italian journalists are under 24/7 police protection because of mafia threats or attempts on their lives.\n\nItaly, ranked 41st out of 180 countries, has among the worst rankings in Europe, with only about 10 countries on the continent faring worse. Though politicians are nicer to journalists than in previous years, reporters are still verbally and physically targeted by the far right Five Star Movement, which is part of the government coalition.\n\n26. Malta\n\n• Population: 502,653\n\n• GDP per capita: $45,652\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.2 – 81st out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.7 – 77th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nThough Freedom House gives Malta a \"free\" assessment, the assassination in 2017 of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was investigating government links to dodgy investment deals, rocked the the Mediterranean island nation and it slipped four spots on the RSF World Press Freedom Index to 81st. Massive protests over how the inquiry into Galizia's death was handled and revelations of extensive government corruption led to the resignation of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Despite a change in government, the media claims state interference such as unlawful detention of journalists has continued.\n\n25. Bahrain\n\n• Population: 1,641,172\n\n• GDP per capita: $46,892\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 60.1 – 169th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 61.3 – 167th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nMedia outlets and journalists in Bahrain are under strict official control. The major TV and radio networks are owned by the state and avoid criticism of the ruling class. A critical newspaper was shut down in 2017. Freedom House said in 2018 that legislation is used to detain or jail critical journalists and online activists.\n\nRSF called Bahrain \"notorious for jailing many journalists, especially photographers and cameramen.\" Dissent or criticism of the government or its policies is basically illegal. Foreign journalists face many obstacles before being granted a press visa to the kingdom.\n\n24. United Kingdom\n\n• Population: 66,834,405\n\n• GDP per capita: $48,710\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.9 – 35th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.2 – 33rd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nJournalists in the United Kingdom are free to report on all aspects of life and virtually all political opinions are reflected in the media. The country, home to the world-renowned BBC, recently co-hosted a Global Conference for Media Freedom and has taken on the role of co-chair of the new Media Freedom Coalition. However, it is not without some problems relating to press freedom.\n\nRecently, the country's Conservative Party threatened a review of BBC's license fee that all households with a TV pay, and a review of the publicly owned, public service network Channel 4.\n\n23. Saudi Arabia\n\n• Population: 34,268,528\n\n• GDP per capita: $48,908\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 62.1 – 170th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 65.9 – 172nd out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nThere is no press freedom in Saudi Arabia as there are no independent media outlets and journalists are under close surveillance, according to RSF. Criticism of the government or royal family is not allowed and self-censorship is prevalent. Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist often critical of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. A 2019 UN report found \"credible evidence\" that the crown prince and other senior officials were responsible for the killing.\n\nThe government admits to widespread internet censorship, targeting several kinds of articles including those from political sites.\n\n22. France\n\n• Population: 67,059,887\n\n• GDP per capita: $49,435\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 22.9 – 34th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 22.2 – 32nd out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe French press operates with little restraint and there is a diversity of media in France, although there is some concern at RSF about the concentration of media in the hands of a few companies. Violence against journalists increased in 2019 as many in the media were tear-gassed or injured while covering protests by the anti-tax demonstrators from the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vest) movement. RSF also noted a surge in judicial interference intended to force reporters covering sensitive stories to reveal sources. Twelve people at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were killed in 2015 by Islamic extremists after the publication published cartoons they considered blasphemous.\n\n21. Finland\n\n• Population: 5,520,314\n\n• GDP per capita: $51,324\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 7.9 – 2nd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 7.9 – 2nd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nBefore Finland dropped to third place in 2017's World Press Freedom Index, the country was No. 1 for seven years in a row. Since then, Finland has moved up again, maintaining second place since 2019. Several measures were taken in 2019 by the government to limit the targeting of journalists with the purpose of silencing them. However, existing regulations are vague and weak, according to RSF. Police and courts have refused to take on big cases and therefore review of applicable laws and strong precedent cases is urgently required.\n\nThe organization also notes that journalists in Finland are not immune to pressure, giving as an example some politicians who have encouraged behavior aimed at suppressing voices in social media.\n\n20. Canada\n\n• Population: 37,589,262\n\n• GDP per capita: $51,342\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.3 – 16th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.7 – 18th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nCanada has been vigorous in defending press freedom. This was underscored by a law passed in 2017 that says journalists cannot be required to reveal confidential sources unless a judge is convinced the information can't be obtained any other way or it is in the public interest that the source be revealed.\n\nIn 2019, Canada and the United Kingdom created the Media Freedom Coalition in July 2019, an international alliance that champions and protects press freedom.\n\n19. Kuwait\n\n• Population: 4,207,083\n\n• GDP per capita: $51,912\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 34.3 – 109th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 33.9 – 108th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nSimilar to other Persian Gulf countries, Kuwait ranks relatively low in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, but it's the least repressive among them, according to RSF. State broadcasters work in cooperation with privately owned outlets and criticism of the emir and the government is not tolerated. The cyber-crime law applies to bloggers and online journalists, and they have to apply to the government for licenses.\n\nThere are many arrests and convictions of bloggers and online activists. They face charges of destabilizing the country if they make any derogatory comments about the emir, the royal family, its allies, or religion.\n\n18. Australia\n\n• Population: 25,364,307\n\n• GDP per capita: $53,320\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 20.2 – 26th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 16.6 – 21st out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThough press freedom is not mentioned directly in its constitution, the media have historically had free rein to operate in Australia, which is regarded as \"free\" by Freedom House. Even so, journalists were reminded of the fragility of press freedom in 2019 when the home of a reporter and the headquarters of state-run Australian Broadcasting Corporation were raided by police based on claims of national security following reporting of alleged misconduct of Australian troops in Afghanistan. Australia also has among the strictest defamation laws in a liberal democracy.\n\n17. Belgium\n\n• Population: 11,484,055\n\n• GDP per capita: $54,545\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.6 – 12th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 12.1 – 9th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Environment and self-censorship\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nBelgium's constitution is very precise about guaranteeing press freedom. It states that \"the press is free; censorship may never be established and no security may be demanded from writers, publishers or printers [and] where the author is known and resides in Belgium, the publisher, printer or distributor may not be prosecuted.\"\n\nThough historically the media has been free in Belgium, the situation for journalists is worsening, according to RSF. In an unprecedented move, reporters with a Flemish-language TV station protested the lack of resources and budget cuts imposed by the Flemish government. Another protest addressed the sudden dismissal of journalists from L'Avenir, who were investigating a financial scandal involving the company that owns the newspaper.\n\n16. Sweden\n\n• Population: 10,285,453\n\n• GDP per capita: $55,815\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 9.3 – 4th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 8.3 – 3rd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Environment and self-censorship\n\nIn Sweden, ranked fourth in press freedom by the RSF, the media are mostly privately owned, though the RSF points out that five media companies own more than 50% of local media outlets. Swedish public media are funded by taxes rather than licensing.\n\nAbout one-third of Swedish journalists say they have been targets of online threats. Exiled Iranian journalists in Sweden have received threats from the Iranian government. Law enforcement takes an active role in combating attacks against the press.\n\nFast food improvements:Burger King parent company shows signs of recovery thanks to drive-thrus\n\nDriving an old car?:Vehicles on the road keep getting older, and COVID-19 could push the age higher\n\n15. Germany\n\n• Population: 83,132,799\n\n• GDP per capita: $56,052\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.2 – 11th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 14.6 – 13th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nGermany, which has the biggest population and the largest and most competitive television market in the European Union, improved its press freedom score and ranking since 2019. Germany, which has a history of controlling the media under the Nazi regime and later in East Germany under communist rule, is serious about preserving the freedom of the press – the constitution guarantees it. In May 2020, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled mass surveillance unconstitutional. This makes spying on foreign journalists illegal and protects informants who want to remain confidential.\n\nHowever, the RSF warns of a slow but steady erosion of media pluralism for economic reasons, as well as weak laws on information access.\n\n14. Austria\n\n• Population: 8,877,067\n\n• GDP per capita: $59,111\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.8 – 18th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.3 – 16th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe constitution and the Media Law of 1981 underpin press freedom in Austria. However, libel and slander laws remain in place and shield politicians and government officials. Given its history of anti-Semitism, Austrian law forbids any form of neo-Nazism or anti-Semitism, as well as denial of the Holocaust. Media ownership in Austria is still highly concentrated.\n\nA scandal involving the chairman of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria brought down the right/far right ruling coalition led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, prompting the formation of a new government that included the more left-leaning Green Party. That has not stopped the government from denying the media certain information held by the government.\n\n13. Netherlands\n\n• Population: 17,332,850\n\n• GDP per capita: $59,687\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 10.0 – 5th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 8.6 – 4th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Netherlands, which ranks fifth in the World Press Freedom Index, belongs to the 8% of the countries that are classified as having a \"good\" situation. The government supports a free press, according to RSF. However, the organization warns of worrisome emerging trends. Far right populist politicians have been questioning the legitimacy of established media and aggression against journalists is a serious concern, as online attacks, including death threats, are frequent.\n\nFreedom of the press and free speech are guaranteed by the constitution and media organizations are allocated airtime on TV and radio based on the number of members they have. Competition between commercial and public stations is fierce. In addition, people have access to a lot of domestic and foreign channels.\n\n12. Denmark\n\n• Population: 5,818,553\n\n• GDP per capita: $59,830\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 8.1 – 3rd out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 9.9 – 5th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe Scandinavian nation of Denmark ranks third in the RSF listing in press freedom. Denmark has a long history of freedom of expression that was included in a provision in the nation's constitution of 1849. Danish media express a variety of opinions and are frequently critics of the government. The Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten published cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed that were later reprinted by the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo in France.\n\nDenmark was shaken in 2017 when Swedish journalist Kim Wall was killed in Copenhagen by a Danish man who was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2018.\n\n11. Iceland\n\n• Population: 361,313\n\n• GDP per capita: $60,061\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.1 – 15th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 14.7 – 14th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nThe sparsely populated North Atlantic island, famous as much for its hot springs as for its first ranking in gender equality, has dropped slightly in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index. Iceland's current score of 15.1 is noticeably worse than the country's Nordic neighbors, all of which have a score of under 10.\n\nThe constitution of Iceland guarantees absolute freedom of speech and there are laws protecting whistleblowers, sources, and media independence, but relations between outlets and politicians have worsened and ownership is highly concentrated.\n\n10. Hong Kong SAR, China\n\n• Population: 7,507,400\n\n• GDP per capita: $62,375\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 30.0 – 80th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 29.7 – 73rd out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nPress freedom is under siege in Hong Kong, whose standing in the RSF rankings fell seven places to 80. The territory was designated a special administrative region following the handover to the People's Republic of China from Great Britain in 1997. The agreement provided for freedom of expression but there has been repression by Beijing. The result has been self-censorship among journalists reluctant to criticize the communist regime.\n\nIn 2018, Victor Mallet was forced out as editor of the Financial Times Asia because he chaired an event for the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong that rankled the Chinese government. The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong controls in part or in whole two daily newspapers in the SAR.\n\n9. Brunei Darussalam\n\n• Population: 433,285\n\n• GDP per capita: $64,673\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 49.7 – 152th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 51.5 – 152th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nBrunei, an absolute monarchy in which the sultan exercises executive power, shows no improvement for journalists' freedom. In 2020, Brunei's ranking remained at 152 out of 180 countries, though the country's score has improved slightly. Self-censorship persists for the state-owned Radio Television Brunei and for the major daily newspapers, which the sultan's family owns.\n\nRepressive legislation, rendered even harsher by the introduction and enforcement of a strict version of Islamic Sharia law, discourages any content deemed critical of the royal family. Bloggers posting independently reported information can be charged with criminal defamation.\n\n8. United States\n\n• Population: 328,239,523\n\n• GDP per capita: $65,281\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 23.9 – 45th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 25.7 – 48th out of 180 (\"problematic\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nSince Donald Trump became president in 2017, the chief executive and the media have had a confrontational relationship. The president has limited access to some journalists and denigrated others. He's chided the media for what he calls \"fake news.\" Anti-press sentiment has found its way into public polls and a growing segment of the public does not trust the media. Although the United States has among the strongest press protections in the world, the media have become more polarized since Trump became president. This has contributed to the United States' 45th ranking on the RSF World Press Freedom Index list.\n\nRecent U.S. government hostility to the media predates Trump. In 2013, New York Times national security correspondent David Sanger said the Obama administration was \"the most closed, control freak administration\" he had ever covered.\n\n7. Norway\n\n• Population: 5,347,896\n\n• GDP per capita: $66,832\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 7.8 – 1st out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 7.8 – 1st out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nNorway has topped RSF's Press Freedom Index since 2017. Historically, Europe's northernmost country has ranked high in terms of freedom from censorship and pressure from government officials. The country seems to want to do even better. The government mandated a review of the conditions for freedom of speech. Those involved have to consider measures to promote public debate, stop fake news and hate speech, keep journalists safe, and counter self-censorship.\n\nPublic broadcaster NRK operates alongside major privately owned TV and radio networks. As of 2020, NRK is funded by the state budget through a dedicated tax as opposed to license fees.\n\n6. United Arab Emirates\n\n• Population: 9,770,529\n\n• GDP per capita: $69,901\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 42.7 – 131st out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 43.6 – 133rd out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nFreedom House has determined that the United Arab Emirates is \"not free\" and it is ranked 131st on RSF's World Press Freedom Index. The nation on the Arabian Peninsula guarantees press freedom under its constitution, however, a law passed in 1980 lets authorities censor local or foreign publications if they criticize UAE's domestic policies, the economy, the ruling families, or religion. This is considered to be one of the most restrictive press laws in the world.\n\nThe UAE has pursued robust surveillance of journalists online and in 2017 imprisoned a blogger for posting \"false information, rumors and lies,\" which the nation said damaged the UAE's reputation.\n\n5. Switzerland\n\n• Population: 8,574,832\n\n• GDP per capita: $70,989\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 10.5 – 6th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 10.6 – 8th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nSwitzerland ranks eighth in RSF's 2020 Global Index of Press Freedom, two spots below its placement in 2019. Though the country continues to rank high and is considered safe for journalists, financial problems in the Swiss media industry may spell trouble, according to RSF.\n\nThe media makes most of its money from TV license fees. Some funding comes from advertising. The digital revolution has hit outlets, which continue to close and content has become less diverse.\n\nTroubles aside, Switzerland is among just 14 countries – or about 8% of the 180 nations RSF has reviewed – with a \"good\" situation in terms of freedom of the press.\n\n4. Ireland\n\n• Population: 4,941,444\n\n• GDP per capita: $88,241\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 12.6 – 13th out of 180 (\"good\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.0 – 15th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nIreland gained two spots on the RSF ranking and rose to 13th on the World Press Freedom Index. It adopted a referendum in 2018 that decriminalized blasphemy, a move that improved press freedom.\n\nThe press in Ireland is free and independent though RSF and Freedom House express concern about the concentration of media. Independent News and Media controls much of the newspaper sector, while partly state-run company RTE dominates the broadcast market. The frequent awarding of defamation damages by the courts represents a threat to press freedom in the country.\n\n3. Qatar\n\n• Population: 2,832,067\n\n• GDP per capita: $96,491\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 42.5 – 129th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 42.5 – 128th out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Transparency\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Pluralism\n\nQatar is well-known for Al-Jazeera, an international TV broadcaster owned by the government. The channel has a good reputation in the Middle East and the rest of the world, but it avoids criticism of the state. In 2019, the Qatari government abruptly ordered the closure of the Doha Centre for Media Freedom, which protected journalists whose lives were in danger in their home countries.\n\nQatar's press freedom score in 2020 is 42.5, which places it in the second worst category, according to RSF – \"difficult situation.\" Qatar authorities filter online content deemed offensive or objectionable, which includes materials from human rights organizations.\n\n2. Singapore\n\n• Population: 5,703,569\n\n• GDP per capita: $101,376\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 55.2 – 158th out of 180 (\"very serious\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 51.4 – 151st out of 180 (\"difficult\")\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Infrastructure\n\nSingapore may have one of the more robust economies in Asia, but the former British colony is among the most repressive, falling seven spots in the latest World Press Freedom Index rankings to 158th. The nation only has a \"partly free\" assessment by Freedom House.\n\nThe Asian city-state owns all domestic newspapers, radio stations, and television channels through companies connected to the government. Singapore exercises press control using religious and racial tensions and the fear of terrorism to clamp down on the media. Many journalists self-censor and media outlets and bloggers have been penalized for stories and opinions considered to be seditious or defamatory. Defamation lawsuits are common in Singapore. Online news providers must obtain licenses and may have to remove certain content at the request of regulators.\n\n1. Luxembourg\n\n• Population: 619,896\n\n• GDP per capita: $121,293\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2019: 15.7 – 17th out of 180 (\"satisfactory\")\n\n• Freedom of the press score in 2020: 15.5 — 17th out of 180 (“satisfactory”)\n\n• Worst area of press freedom: Media independence\n\n• Best area of press freedom: Legislative framework\n\nLuxembourg ranks 17th in the 2020 Global Index of Press Freedom, the same rank as in 2019. The country's journalists still don't have the right to free access and information. The Luxembourgish association of professional journalists (ALJP) has criticized the government for its limited and centralized information policy. In 2019, journalists at the state-owned radio accused government officials of influencing how the station was being run.\n\nRSF has described press freedom in Luxembourg, the richest country in the world by GDP per capita, as pluralist but dependent on business interests.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the degree of freedom available to journalists in the world’s richest countries, 24/7 Wall St. ranked 2020 World Press Freedom Index scores from Paris-based international non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in the 50 countries with the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.\n\nRSF administered a survey to media professionals, lawyers, sociologists, and other experts around the world and combined these survey results with quantitative data on abuses and violence against journalists and media outlets. This data was collected in 2019 for 180 countries. The scores range between 0 (good situation) and 100 (very serious situation).\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita in current international dollars for the 194 countries with available data was obtained from the World Bank. All GDP figures are for 2019, the latest year for which data is available.\n\nMacao SAR, China, San Marino, Aruba, The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Sint Maarten (Dutch part) – the 1st, 6th, 13th, 39th, 42nd, 44th, 48th richest regions based on World Bank GDP per capita – were not among the 180 countries and territories reviewed by RSF.\n\nWe also considered gross national income (GNI) per capita where available, an income measurement that includes income from residents, businesses, and foreign sources. GNI was also obtained from the World Bank. The countries’ population figures also came from the World Bank and are as of 2019.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Shouting broke out among senators when the exemption was removed without a roll call vote. Democrats and some Republicans objected to the change to the bill, which would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony, being gaveled through quickly. Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh suggested lawmakers go home for the weekend to cool off and resume debate Tuesday. Marsh said he supports an exemption for rape and wants a roll call vote on the matter next week. The anger underscored tensions over the proposal that would become the most stringent abortion restriction in the country if approved.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Eight conservation groups sued Tuesday to stop the largest sale of Alaska old growth timber in decades, claiming the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental policy and its own management plan for the Tongass National Forest with the sale. The agency’s plan is to harvest as much as 225 million board feet of old growth timber from Prince of Wales Island. The Forest Service didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason, who has dealt two setbacks to the Trump administration this year. She found that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when reversing bans on offshore drilling and that the administration violated federal law with a proposed road that would split a wilderness area in a national wildlife refuge.\n\nArizona\n\nMarble Canyon: One of the most exclusive and dramatic hiking spots in the Southwest could see bigger crowds under a new proposal unveiled Wednesday. The Bureau of Land Management is weighing increasing its daily visitor limits from 20 to 96 people a day at The Wave, a popular rock formation near the Arizona-Utah border. A 6-mile round-trip hike through tall sandstone buttes and sage brush is required to get to the Wave, a wide, sloping basin of searing reds, oranges and yellows in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument. The agency is asking for public comment, and changes could be implemented as soon as October, agency official Mike Herder says. Visitors compete for permits in a monthly online lottery and at daily walk-in drawings. Less than 5% of the 150,000 people who wanted to hike the trail last year were actually able to do it, according to federal data.\n\nArkansas\n\nBatesville: A juvenile detention facility synonymous with neglect and abuse is to be shuttered and the building transformed into a treatment center for sex trafficking survivors, officials say. White River Regional Juvenile Detention Center will close by this summer, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Jonathan Pickering, facility director, says the new center will provide youths who were forced into the sex trade with at least three individual and three group therapy sessions a week. Pickering says families can join the sessions too, and staff will arrange transportation if necessary. The facility has a storied history. In April, a former White River jailer was sentenced to seven years in prison for what a judge called “sadistic and completely unjustified” punishments for disorderly juveniles. Another was imprisoned in March for violating youths’ rights and falsifying documents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo has two new arrivals: a pair of endangered African penguin chicks. The zoo announced Wednesday that the fluffy chicks – named Doug and Barbara in honor of Douglas G. Myers, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Global, and his wife, Barbara Myers – hatched two months ago. The eggs came from two breeding couples. The zoo says it’s the first time eggs laid by its adult penguins have hatched there. Staffers have been working with the chicks to get them used to humans before they are introduced into the penguin colony in the next few weeks. African penguins are an endangered species. Their numbers have dropped by more than 60% in the past three decades, and only 23,000 breeding pairs are known to exist. The decline is blamed on several factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and lack of food from overfishing, climate change and pollution.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The end-of-semester Undie Run at Colorado State University started innocently enough, with a few hundred participants in their skivvies and a handful of clothes-filled trash bags carted off to Goodwill, according to its first student organizer. But more than a decade later, CSU is putting its foot down, taking its hardest stance yet against an event it now says is characterized by public intoxication and rampant sexual misconduct. Its message – in a letter distributed to students, emailed to parents and printed in multiple full-page ads in the campus newspaper – is clear: “The university will not allow the ‘undie run’ to take place this year.” The run, which has never been sanctioned or supported by CSU, has sprung up every spring since 2008 thanks to Facebook groups led by largely unnamed organizers and campus word-of-mouth. It’s typically held on the last day of classes before finals week, which for this semester is Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has voted to incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023, following a marathon, overnight debate. Weary lawmakers advanced the bill to the Senate, 85-59, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition, shortly after noon Thursday. The occasionally contentious debate, which began about 10 p.m. Wednesday, was wrapped by New Haven Rep. Robyn Porter, the Democratic House chairwoman of the General Assembly’s Labor Committee. Referencing her own early struggles as a divorced mother of two, Porter said the wage increase will help those who “don’t have two nickels to rub together” and feel like $10 is $100. But Republicans warned the wage increase will harm an already fragile state economy and lead to job reductions and more automation.\n\nDelaware\n\nMilford: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, one of the state’s best-known businesses, announced Thursday that it is merging with Boston Beer Co., the makers of Sam Adams beer and Angry Orchard hard cider. The merger, valued at about $300 million, is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions. It’s a stunning turn of events for the Milford-based, independent brewery founded by Sam Calagione, a Massachusetts native, and his wife Mariah, who was born in Delaware. Dogfish Head plans to retain its name and will still be a craft brewery, according to a press release sent out Thursday. The brewery began in Rehoboth Beach in 1995 as a “nanobrewery.” As the company grew, brewing moved to its current Milton site. The brewery and the tasting room have since become one of Delaware’s top tourist destinations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chair of the City Council has proposed an amendment to the city’s 2020 budget that would severely limit access to public records. The Washington Post reports the legislation would allow the city to reject record requests that don’t include specifications about the sought documents, including the subject matter, names of senders and recipients, and a date range. It would only permit the disclosure of information “regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.” Chairman Phil Mendelson says the Freedom of Information Act “wasn’t intended for fishing expeditions.” His proposal comes after the newspaper requested email records through FOIA and found that Councilman Jack Evans used his government email to pitch himself to area lobbyists.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show. Oxygen Media, which in 2017 announced a full-time shift to true-crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on “America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State” has been added to its projects. There is no premiere date for the show. The series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films “Get Out,” “The Purge” and “Insidious.” With the working title of “Florida Man,” the series will “unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension,” Oxygen officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s law enforcement will have to preserve rape kits for much longer than what was previously required under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this week. Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, the bill’s main supporter, says the DNA evidence in the rape kits will help solve cold cases and pursue justice for survivors of sexual violence. Previously, Georgia only required rape kits to be stored for 10 years. The new law requires the state to preserve the evidence 30 years after the arrest date or seven years from the completion of a prison sentence, whichever occurs later. If there are no arrests, the kit must be stored for 50 years. Holcomb also authored a 2016 law that helped cut down on the state’s backlog of rape kits.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal officials are asking the public to give adequate space to a monk seal that has been resting on a Waikiki beach. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that the female seal identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi has come onto the beach in Honolulu four times in recent days. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species protected by state and federal laws that typically forages at night and “hauls up” to rest on beaches during the day. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials ask members of the public in the high-traffic area to remain behind barriers set up to protect the seal. Officials say Kaiwi has previously given birth to pups in south and east Oahu. Although she does not appear pregnant at this time, it is possible.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State agencies are racing to beat a Friday deadline to keep alive thousands of administrative rules after the Legislature’s House of Representatives in April killed a bill reauthorizing them. Republican Gov. Brad Little directed state agencies to submit temporary and pending rules by Friday to be vetted before publication in a special Idaho Administrative Bulletin on June 19. A 21-day public comment period follows before the rules can attain temporary status by July 1 and remain in effect. Many state agencies have started the process, and on Wednesday the Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in a special meeting voted 4-0 to authorize the Idaho Department of Lands to initiate temporary rulemaking on the agency’s oil and gas regulations.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Plans are in the works to open a visitors’ center for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Laurent House, which opened as a museum four years ago. The Rockford Register Star reports the Laurent House Foundation plans to renovate dilapidated properties across the street from the home. It will offer a visitors’ center and gift shop and have offices and parking. Private donations are funding the $500,000 project. An estimated 2,000 people toured the home last year, and it has attracted visitors from Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. The 2,600-square-foot Laurent House, built in the early 1950s, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It’s the only house Wright designed specifically for someone with disabilities. The foundation won approval Monday from the Rockford City Council to annex the properties.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Sports betting will become legal and construction of two new casinos will be allowed in the state under a bill signed by the governor Wednesday. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb endorsed the bill on his final day to act on the measure approved by lawmakers after they reached a deal in the final hours of this year’s legislative session. So far this year, Indiana joins Montana and Tennessee in moving to legalize sports wagering after six other states moved quickly following a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing it nationwide last year. Indiana sports wagering could start in September. Bets could be placed by anyone 21 or older at a casino or by mobile devices after a bettor has registered with an Indiana casino. Holcomb says the state’s casino industry has faced greater competition as neighboring states have legalized more forms of gambling.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: In an effort to help the environment without skimping on photographic fun, the University of Iowa Pentacrest Museums, made up of the Old Capitol Museum and the Museum of Natural History, have made an enticing offer for graduates. Confetti has always been a part of graduations, but the museum group wants it to become a thing of the past, posting on its Facebook page that it’s ready to digitally alter graduation photos to add confetti. The post asked students to consider that “many kinds of confetti are not biodegradable and are a health risk to our wildlife.” Interested students can message the Facebook page directly or email jessica-smith-7@uiowa.edu to send their photos to a museum designer.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A new government report says the state’s winter wheat crop is maturing more slowly than usual. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported this week that about 14% of the wheat has now headed. That is near what it was a year ago but well behind the 41% average for the date. The agency also rated wheat condition as 10% poor to very poor, 32% in fair shape, and 58% in good to excellent condition. Growers have also seeded about 41% of their corn acreage, behind the 51% that is normally in the ground by this time. Planting of soybean and sorghum crops in Kansas is just getting underway, with progress at or near the average.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign is capitalizing on a fellow Republican’s attack, selling “Cocaine Mitch” shirts on his campaign’s website. The shirts appear to have been hot sellers. The Kentucky Republican’s campaign Twitter account said Wednesday that McConnell was closing in on one of his biggest fundraising days of the year and thanked people who chipped in by purchasing shirts. The shirt shows a faceless figure with a sprinkling of cocaine on the side. It says “Mitch” on the front and “cartel member” on the back. The Senate leader’s campaign is laughing off an attack by ex-coal executive and failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship, who called him “Cocaine Mitch” after a magazine article alleged drugs were found aboard a cargo ship owned by the family of McConnell’s wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to exempt diapers and tampons from the state sales tax stalled Wednesday in the Senate, only to be revived later in a different form and successfully sent to the House for debate. Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat, proposed a constitutional change to remove the 4.45% state sales tax from diapers and feminine hygiene products starting in 2021. Senators refused to include that exemption in the state constitution. The Senate voted 21-12 for the measure, but it needed 26 votes to pass because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote. But later in the day, after stymieing the constitutional change, senators agreed to include the tax break in statute. That law change passed in a 29-5 vote, moving to the House for consideration. Morrell said the items are essential to women and children, in line with prescription drugs, which are exempt from sales tax.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor is bringing back the state’s Children’s Cabinet in hopes of reducing youth drop-out, recidivism and incarceration rates. Gov. Janet Mills says in a Thursday announcement that she wants to focus on helping Maine children succeed in school, enter the workforce and live healthy lives. The governor says 37 towns of the top 50 with the highest poverty rates in New England in 2010 were located in Maine. She says 1 in 6 Maine children is living in poverty. The Children’s Cabinet dates back to 1996 and last met in 2010. The cabinet has urged Maine to expand quality and accessible early child care and education. Mills also wants to address the number of children suffering substantiated child abuse, which is up 25% from 2017 to 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Some Marylanders are at risk of having their driver’s licenses or identification cards recalled next month if they don’t soon satisfy document requirements that are part of the federally mandated Real ID process, according to a state agency. Some residents who have the new Real ID card still must bring in certain documentation to comply with the federal REAL ID requirement, according to a Thursday news release from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. The overall deadline for obtaining a Real ID is Oct. 1, 2020, but more than 66,300 people with a new Real ID star license or identification card have not yet filed the required documents, the release says. Without action, MVA says, administrators will start flagging the affected driver’s licenses and identification cards in June as “recalled,” which would result in confiscation if drivers get pulled over.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDartmouth: The federal government says a program that sells scallops to pay for marine science will include a study of how shellfish harvesting affects sea turtles in this year’s projects. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside will help pay for 13 projects in 2019 and 2020. Regulators use the program to set aside more than a million pounds of scallops, generating millions of dollars for the science projects. Fishermen and scientists collaborate on the program. This year’s awards include a pair to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to use underwater cameras to get a better handle on East Coast scallop population health. The award to study sea turtles is slated to go to the Coonamessett Farm Foundation and Roger Williams University.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: There’s one more sign a riverfront concert venue has been renamed after Aretha Franklin. Workers on Thursday were taking down the Chene Park sign outside the venue and putting up one reflecting the name change. It features a stylized signature of the Queen of Soul’s first name. Mayor Mike Duggan told mourners at Franklin’s funeral in August that the name would be changed to Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre, saying that “when Aretha Franklin sang, it sounded like the voice of Detroit.” Days later, City Council unanimously approved it. The facility is known for its outdoor stage and summer concerts, and it hosted a Franklin tribute show last summer. She performed at Chene Park in 2015 to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The 2019 season starts in June. Franklin died Aug. 16 at 76.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Lawmakers are trying to get their hands around skyrocketing drug costs and the pharmaceutical industry that sets the prices. Bills are moving to tackle the problem, from anti-price gouging efforts to new reporting requirements for drug companies when prices spike. Minnesota Public Radio reports that nearly all those bills have been tucked into House and Senate budget bills and are heading into final negotiations. The bipartisan push has been fueled by personal stories. Nicole Smith-Holt has been a regular around the Capitol, talking about her son Alec Smith, a diabetic who died at age 26 because he was rationing insulin that he couldn’t afford. Both the House and Senate health and human services budgets include assistance for emergency insulin supplies, but their different approaches need to be reconciled.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A police officer helped a driver out of a wrecked sports car and told the man he was “lucky to be alive.” Less than an hour later, the officer was killed by another person who walked up and shot him outside the police station. Biloxi police records show Patrolman Robert McKeithen responded to a crash Sunday night and then returned to the station because he had gotten a flat tire. The driver, Damon Corrigan, 22, told the Sun Herald that McKeithen also accompanied him to a hospital. He says he was shocked to learn the officer had been killed. “The only thing I remember him telling me was that I was so lucky to be alive,” Corrigan told the newspaper. “He was so nice. I felt so bad.” McKeithen, 57, had worked for Biloxi Police Department for almost 24 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republicans in the state House are backing away from a budget compromise that would allow colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition to students living in the country illegally. The GOP-led House on Thursday voted 110-43 against the deal. That means a panel of lawmakers will get another shot to negotiate on the policy and the proposed state budget for public colleges and universities. Missouri schools currently face losing state funding if they offer those students anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Bipartisan Senate and House negotiators earlier this week agreed to end that policy. But opposition from House Republicans could unravel the deal. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass the budget.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill to continue the state’s Medicaid expansion program for another six years, as long as federal funding continues. He was joined at Thursday’s signing ceremony by bill sponsor Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey and Democratic Rep. Mary Caferro, who sponsored a separate bill that did not pass. The program provides health insurance to about 95,000 low-income adults. Buttrey’s bill adds work requirements, strengthens an asset test and increases premiums for people who stay on the program for more than two years. Bullock on Thursday also vetoed a bill that sought to give regulatory backing to insurance companies so they could negotiate better contracts with pharmacy benefit managers for policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Bullock argued the legislation could lead to higher costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge is considering his verdict in a lawsuit that says six convenience stores along Interstate 80 in the state posted misleading signs about prices. A nonjury trial was held last in week in Lincoln in a February 2017 lawsuit filed by several individuals and the Coalition for Ethical Petroleum Marketing. It accuses North Platte-based Wilkinson Development of violating the Nebraska Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act. Wilkinson is accused of advertising low prices to attract travelers to its Fat Dog stores but then selling gas at those prices only at a limited number of pumps, intentionally hoping travelers accidentally filled up with more expensive fuel. The company president has denied the accusation.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An unusually wet stretch of showers and thunderstorms may help Sin City surpass its yearly average for rainfall this week. And it’s not even monsoon season yet. Since January, the National Weather Service has logged 3.8 inches of rainfall in Las Vegas – a few thimbles away from the yearly average of 4.19 inches. “Getting over (4.19 inches) isn’t impossible,” says meteorologist Kate Guillet. “We’re just going to have to wait and see.” The National Weather Service estimates a quarter to a half an inch of rain could fall on the Las Vegas Valley between Thursday and Sunday – and higher amounts are possible.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: As some states and communities have slowly begun to acknowledge their often purposeful erasure of Native Americans from the dominant narrative, the voices, cultures and histories of the Abenaki and Wabanaki peoples were recently given a rightful home in the oldest “neighborhood” settled by Europeans in what’s now the state of New Hampshire. “People of the Dawnland,” an exhibit at the Jones House Family Discover Center in the 1600s Puddle Dock neighborhood, opens this month. The neighborhood, now known as the outdoor Strawbery Banke Museum, did in fact have remnants of indigenous people, such as pottery, projectile points and tent holes, discovered by archaeologists, but the museum has previously largely focused its efforts on the colonial aspects of the early settlement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s beaches, casinos, forests and cities attracted tourists who spent nearly $45 billion last year. Gov. Phil Murphy says tourism spending in New Jersey has increased for nine years in a row. Speaking at a tourism conference Thursday in Trenton, Murphy said the tourism industry generated $5 billion in state and local taxes in 2018. He said about 111 million people visited the Garden State last year, up more than 7% from the previous year. Tourism is the state’s seventh-largest industry, supporting nearly 334,000 jobs. When indirect jobs, such as those that supply the industry, are included, the figure rises to more than 531,000 jobs. Food and beverages and lodging accounted for the largest share of tourism spending.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: World-premiere operas derived from the gender-bending Broadway hit “M. Butterfly” and from meditations on Victorian-era repression in Bram Stroker’s “Dracula” are coming to the Santa Fe Opera and its open-air stage in the high desert. Opera General Director Robert Meya on Wednesday announced upcoming productions for 2020 that include retooled staples such as “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” (“The Barber of Seville”) and the revival of Tim Albery’s version of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (“The Magic Flute”). In recent years, Santa Fe has been the backdrop for productions about the dawn of the nuclear age in 1940s New Mexico and a world premiere of a techno-infused opera about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been a regular visitor to performances in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Anna Sorokin, the German con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress to swindle banks, hotels and friends, was sentenced Thursday to four to 12 years behind bars. New York Judge Diane Kiesel said at the sentencing hearing that she was “stunned by the depth of the defendant’s deception” and turned down a request by Sorokin’s lawyers that she be sentenced to time she has already spent in jail awaiting trial. Sorkin, 28, was convicted last month on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services and has been in custody since her October 2017 arrest. Sorokin went by Anna Delvey when she defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan celebrity circles into believing she had a fortune of about $67 million overseas that could cover her jet-setting lifestyle, high-end clothing and lavish hotel stays.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMurphy: The U.S. Forest Service is proposing one of the largest timber sales in the nearly 100-year history of the Nantahala National Forest, and the public comment period ends Friday. The proposal, known as the Buck Project, is drawing concern from conservation groups worried about harmful effects of logging and road building in this “special place” of potential wilderness and old-growth areas. But it is being welcomed by others who say it will improve forest health and wildlife habitat in forest areas long overdue for a trim. The Buck Project, which includes a timber sale as well as forest restoration activities including prescribed burns and stream improvement projects, would take place in a 20,638-acre analysis area in southeastern Clay County, in the Tusquitee Ranger District of Nantahala, the state’s largest and most western forest.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner says lawmakers may be called back into session over legislation that limits the powers of the state auditor. The Legislature passed a measure late in the session that requires the auditor’s office to get lawmakers’ permission to conduct “performance audits.” The amendment was put in the auditor’s budget that passed unanimously in the Senate and by a large margin in the House. Wardner says he didn’t know the amendment had been put in the budget bill and thinks other senators didn’t, either. Wardner says he and House Minority Leader Chet Pollert will meet with Auditor Josh Gallion next week to discuss the issue and how it will affect the agency. Leaders can recall the Legislature if they haven’t used all their allotted days.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters in the capital have agreed to let the city take on as much as $1 billion more in debt to pay for renovations to roads and bridges, underground utilities and other infrastructure. Near the top of spending among issues approved Tuesday is a new municipal courthouse, estimated to cost about $130 million. Voters also approved reserving $50 million for affordable housing as Columbus prepares for a regional plan to address what experts say is a 54,000-unit shortage. The Columbus Dispatch reports this is the largest bond package approved since 2008, when voters passed a $1.7 billion debt plan, mostly to pay for water and sewer projects. The projects won’t raise taxes, but the city could raise property taxes if it can’t repay the debt.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former U.S. soldier from the state who was pardoned this week for his 2009 conviction for killing an Iraqi prisoner says he initially didn’t answer the White House’s phone call to tell him of the pardon. Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna says he was on the phone with his father, retired FBI agent Scott Behenna, when the call came about 2:30 p.m. Monday as he was driving. He didn’t recognize the number and thought it might be a telemarketer, so he let it go to voicemail. After checking his messages, he returned the call and was told President Donald Trump was granting him a pardon and would call him back. When Behenna’s phone rang again, it was Trump’s office putting the president on the line so he could tell Behenna personally. He was convicted in 2009 of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone in the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur Mohamed, an unarmed Iraqi prisoner.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A bill to allow dentists in the state to administer vaccines to patients has been signed into law. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Oregon is the first state in the country to allow dentists to administer any vaccine available at a primary care doctor’s office. Most people may not get their measles, polio and tetanus shots from the dentist, but Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry Dean Phillip Marucha says they might want vaccines relevant to oral health such as HPV. He says a large percentage of new oral cancer diagnoses are linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can also cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Marucha said this law allows a dentist to educate patients about the value of the HPV vaccine and then administer it onsite.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The State Board of Education is giving its support to proposals by Gov. Tom Wolf to require students start schooling by age 6 and continue until they’re at least 18. The board voted unanimously Wednesday for the Democratic governor’s proposals that he unveiled in February. The Republican-controlled Legislature still must approve the proposals for them to take effect. The Wolf administration says lowering the mandatory start age from 8 to 6 would affect about 3,300 children. Officials say only one other state allows parents to keep children out of school until age 8, a policy Pennsylvania adopted in the late 19th century. Pennsylvania’s minimum age to drop out of school is currently 17. The administration says nearly 14,000 students drop out without graduating every year in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax “original and creative works” sold by writers, composers and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state’s taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not “original and creative works.” A Department of Revenue spokesman said in a statement that the department had not received notice of the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has agreed to provide $120 million in tax breaks to the Carolina Panthers to move their practice fields and team headquarters out of North Carolina. The 27-15 vote Thursday came after contentious debate, with several senators questioning whether public money should be given to a billionaire NFL owner and saying the $3.8 billion proposed economic benefit of the new facility is wildly exaggerated. The bill, enthusiastically backed by Gov. Henry McMaster, would exempt the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. The team will continue to play games 15 miles north in Charlotte, North Carolina. McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The latest federal census of agriculture finds the number of farms in the state has dropped. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2017 census, South Dakota’s farmland was worked by fewer farming operations from 2012 to 2017. The census is conducted every five years. Statewide, more than 43 million acres were operated as farms. But there were 2,000 fewer farming operations in the state in 2017 than in 2012. The Aberdeen News reports the biggest drop came from farms operating between 10 and 1,000 acres. That number dropped by 1,850 over those five years. Nate Franzen, president of the Ag Banking Division at First Dakota National Bank based in Yankton, cites several reasons why farming operations are going out of business, including retirement, financial struggles and other business opportunities.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The National Civil Rights Museum is being honored by a federal agency that supports the nation’s museums. The Institute of Museum and Library Services said in a news release Tuesday that the Memphis-based museum is one of 10 recipients of National Medal for Museum and Library Service. Institute officials say the award honors museums and libraries that make exceptional contributions to their communities. Opened in 1991, the museum is built on the site of the former Lorraine Motel. Civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was fatally shot while standing on the hotel’s balcony April 4, 1968. The museum chronicles the history of the U.S. civil rights movement and holds discussions and events related to civil and human rights issues.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Electricity demand is expected to hit record levels this summer, and with a thin margin of reserve power, the operator of the state’s grid says it may have to ask businesses and consumers to conserve. Officials at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are not ruling out rolling blackouts, although they say other measures are more likely, including importing power from other grids. ERCOT predicted Wednesday that demand in the state will rise as high as 74,853 megawatts. That’s 1,300 megawatts higher than the record set last July 19. The grid operator predicts demand will grow at an above-normal rate of 2.5% to 3% every year through 2022. Demand is booming partly because of growing West Texas oil and gas operations and industrial development along the Gulf Coast.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A popular three-day music festival featuring the likes of rapper G-Eazy has been canceled after state officials refused to grant a liquor license. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the authorities cited past drug and alcohol-related violations in refusing to grant a permit for the Bonanza Campout, which was canceled Wednesday. The 4-year-old event had been scheduled for June 21-23 near Heber City, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City. It would have presented 36 artists, including electronic-music producer DJ Snake and Australian pop-rock duo Empire of the Sun. Organizers said in a statement that all ticket and lodging purchases for the event will be refunded and that they plan to have the festival again in 2020.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Lawmakers are considering steps to make it easier for prison inmates to reduce the length of their sentences through good behavior or acts of heroism. The previous “good time” system was repealed in 2005 because it was thought to be too complex. Corrections Commissioner Mike Touchette says Vermont is one of a handful of states that lacks a good time program. Currently only prison work-camp inmates can earn shorter sentences. The Legislature is considering a number of proposals. One would allow inmates and offenders on furlough to earn a five-day sentence reduction for every month without a major discipline violation. Touchette says providing incentives for good behavior and rewarding that good behavior is “much more effective” than pure punishment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam has proclaimed May “Second Chance Month” in a bid to focus attention on criminal justice reform and inmate re-entry programs. Northam said in a statement Wednesday that redemption is a “fundamental American value” and that his administration is committed to making sure that former inmates have the support they need to succeed. The governor’s proclamation comes a few months after he asked Virginians for a second chance following a blackface scandal that almost forced him from office. Northam has since prioritized efforts to address long-standing racial inequities, particularly those related to the criminal justice system. The Democratic governor was recently able to overcome strong opposition from key GOP lawmakers and eliminate the suspension of driver’s licenses for motorists with unpaid court fines and costs.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A state official says wolves should be removed from the federal endangered species list in the entirety of the state. Washington Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind in April wrote a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in support of the proposal to delist wolves in the Lower 48 states. Susewind calls the proposal “appropriate and timely” as wolves are recovering. Wolves in the eastern third of Washington are already delisted. The Center for Biological Diversity criticized the letter, saying the idea of stripping federal protections from wolves is “appalling.” The environmental group contends 72% of Washington residents want federal protection. The federal government has already delisted wolves in the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, as well as in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClay: A new rail trail is set to be built in the state. Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday that the state has signed a letter of intent to purchase land for the project. The trail will use 72 miles of existing rail lines in Clay and Kanawha counties, along the Elk River and Buffalo Creek. Justice says the tracks will be converted into trails for walking, hiking, biking or other recreational purposes. He says the project could become the second-longest rail trail east of the Mississippi. Justice says the he hopes portions of the trail will be up and running by summer 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWest Allis:A plate of eggs stole the attention of social media this week when the president’s favorite TV show, “Fox and Friends,” broadcast from a local diner. Johnny V’s says the plate of a whopping 10 sunny side up eggs that appeared in front of a man deriding politicians’ plans for “free this, free that” was actually part of its King of Johnny V’s breakfast special, which also includes eight huge pancakes, a pound of hash browns, three pieces of bacon, three pieces of sausage, a piece of ham and Texas toast. If a single person can finish it in an hour, they get the meal and a T-shirt free. They also get their picture posted on a wall. The staff was hoping the King challenge would get a shout-out from the Fox TV host, but time apparently didn’t allow for it.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: National forest managers in the western part of the state expect to see large numbers of mushroom hunters in the weeks ahead. Forests that have recently burned are prime places to look for tasty morel mushrooms. A large area of Bridger-Teton National Forest that burned in 2018 could be prime hunting grounds. Morels also like wet weather, and the region has received plenty of rain and snow this spring. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports forest officials have implemented a $300 fee for morel hunters who sell their finds. They will only allow commercial morel hunting in the northern part of the Roosevelt Fire burn area. Recreational morel hunters can hunt anywhere in the forest for free but may not collect more than 3 gallons of morels.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/10"}]}
{"question_id": "20220812_26", "search_time": "2022/08/12/16:56", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/957614/pros-and-cons-of-marriage", "title": "Pros and cons of marriage | The Week UK", "text": "The majority of babies were born out of wedlock last year in England and Wales, for the first time since records began in 1845.\n\nAccording to latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, of 624,828 live births registered, 320,713 were to women who were not married or in a civil partnership at the time – 51.3% of the total. The historic shift “follows the long-term trend of declining marriage rates and increasing numbers of cohabiting couples seen in recent decades”, said head of health analysis Dr James Tucker.\n\nBut he warned that “caution should be taken” when interpreting the latest data, “as we don’t yet know the full impact of the pandemic on marriage and civil partnership statistics”. Sky News pointed out that the births shift “coincided with the Covid-19 lockdown, when weddings and civil partnership ceremonies were not allowed”.\n\nOfficial statistics published earlier this year showed that a total of 213,122 heterosexual couples tied the knot in 2019 – down 50% from the peak in 1972 and the lowest on record since 1862. The rate of same-sex marriages remained unchanged in 2019 from the previous year, however.\n\nSo why might fewer heterosexual couples be choosing to put a ring on it – and what are the advantages and downsides of officially tying the knot?\n\nPro: ‘formalising’ relationship For many people, formalising a relationship in the eyes of the law – or God – is a way of taking a partnership to the next level. “There is something to be said about a true union,” Barbie Adler, founder of matchmaking company Selective Search, told Brides magazine. “Marriage is the ultimate commitment.” According to the mag, even couples who have lived together for years “say they feel more at ease once they said their vows”. And “for many, marriage brings a sense of security, a grounding they can’t get any other way”.\n\nCon: old-fashioned institution Critics have argued that marriage is an old-fashioned, outdated institution. “Back in the 1400s when people were getting married, it was ‘until death do you part’ because people would get married as teenagers and somebody would die in their 20s or early 30s,” wrote relationship coach and author David Wygant in an article for HuffPost. But most people live “a lot longer”, and many “grow” and “evolve” in ways that mean they and their partner “no longer work well together”. Critics also point to the inherent sexism in some wedding traditions, such as a bride wearing a white dress to symbolise virginity, a groom asking a father’s “permission” to marry his daughter, and women taking their husband’s surname. Marriage is “deeply rooted in sexist customs and laws”, said feminist writer Maureen Shaw in Teen Vogue. “Love and fairy tales are nice, but marriage is technically a contract, and it's worth reading the fine-print before signing your name.” Changes in attitudes towards living together and having children out of wedlock offer greater freedom when deciding whether to sign up for this “contract”. Peter Saddington, a relationship counsellor with the charity Relate, told the BBC that “my clients can choose whether or not they want to get married, unlike their parents or their grandparents who felt an obligation to do so”.\n\nPro: financial security Married couples can pass money and assets to each other tax-free, which can save a “significant amount of money if you want to sell assets that would incur capital gains tax (CGT)”, because “splitting or co-owning an asset with your partner would double the tax-free portion”, said Investors’ Chronicle. Other financial benefits include the marriage tax allowance, a tax perk that allows a spouse to use up to £1,260 of their partner’s personal allowance (currently £12,570) “if they earn less than the value of the personal allowance and you are a basic-rate income tax payer”, the magazine explained. People who are married or in civil partnerships also have more financial protection if they separate than unwed couples who split. In the event that “your marriage or civil partnership ends, you can ask for financial support – known as ‘spousal maintenance’ – from your ex-partner as soon as you separate”, in addition to any child maintenance, said Citizens Advice. By contrast, unwed couples don’t have to support each other financially after splitting.\n\nCon: divorce statistics High divorce rates may be putting some people off marriage. “Increasingly, more children are growing up in relationships where parents have separated,” relationship counsellor Saddington told the BBC. “This is one of the biggest influences on whether or not they [themselves] want to get married.” Latest ONS data shows that 103,592 divorces were granted in England and Wales in 2020. That total represented a decrease of 4.5% compared with 2019, but many family court activities were delayed or suspended in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Even without Covid, getting a divorce can be a long and expensive process. A 2018 analysis by Aviva found that 68% of couples who divorce or separate had “financial issues to resolve, with the process taking on average 14-and-a-half months”. The costs involved are also steep. According to the insurance company, couples typically spent “£14,561 on legal and lifestyle costs when they divorce or separate, an increase of 17% since 2014” – and those costs are likely to be even higher now.\n\nPro: excuse for a party Weddings are a rare chance to bring a couple’s nearest and dearest together and celebrate. “My wedding day was, without a doubt, the best day of my life,” PopSugar’s then senior editor Caitlin Gallagher wrote in 2019. “I’m originally from Chicago and my husband is from a very small town in Ireland, so when our two families from different parts of the world finally came together, my heart had never felt so full.”\n\nCon: weddings costs A survey by hitched.com of 2,060 couples who married in 2021 found that the average wedding cost £17,300. With the cost-of-living crisis hitting households nationwide, a growing number of couples planning to wed may be unwilling or unable to splash out on their big day. And those who do may later wish they hadn’t. “I had a big, expensive wedding,” wrote Insider contributor Cheyenne Lentz. “Looking back, I regret spending so much money on one day that could’ve been put toward our future.”\n\nPro: more support after death Marriage or civil partnerships can provide a degree of financial security for a spouse whose partner dies. Unwed couples do not automatically inherit anything when their partner dies if there is no will in place, unlike their married peers. Being married also allows assets to be passed on to spouses free from inheritance tax (IHT). And “you can transfer unused portions of your IHT allowance, which is currently £325,000, to your spouse”, said Investors’ Chronicle. Marrying can also “help to ensure that your partner can continue to live in your house after you die, with the house passing to your children after your spouse’s death”, the magazine added. But “if you are not married or in a civil partnership when you die, your partner may have to pay tax on the property as it would form part of your estate”. Surviving spouses may also be entitled to their partner’s state pension after they die, depending on their level of National Insurance contributions.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957599/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-10-august-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 10 August 2022 | The Week UK", "text": "Domino’s fails in land of the pizza\n\nDomino’s Pizza has been forced to pull out of the home of the pizza.

One father being treated for brain tumor.\n\nUpdate to original story:\n\nA couple with Mississippi ties is suing the federal State Department for refusing to recognize their daughter as a U.S. citizen.\n\nJames Derek Mize and Johnathan Gregg filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Georgia on behalf of their daughter, Simone Mize-Gregg, Lambda Legal announced Tuesday.\n\nSimone, who was born in Britain via a surrogate, was denied American citizenship under a decades-old U.S. policy. Her parents have U.S. citizenship but Gregg has dual citizenship, in the U.S. and Britain.\n\n“Simone was born to two dads, who lovingly and intentionally brought her into the world, and their family is entitled to equal respect from the federal government,” Karen Loewy, senior counsel for Lambda Legal and one of the family’s attorneys said in a release.\n\n“The Supreme Court has been clear that married same-sex couples cannot be denied the same protections that different-sex couples receive, and that includes the right to be recognized as their children’s parents regardless of who has a biological connection to a child. The State Department has no business refusing to recognize Simone as an American citizen just like her parents. We will not allow this State Department to treat LGBT families like second-class citizens.”\n\nOriginal story:\n\nLast July, James Derek Mize and Johnathan Gregg welcomed their daughter, Simone.\n\nBorn via surrogacy in Britain, Simone's birth was \"magical\" for the couple. But, due to a U.S. policy and Gregg's dual British and American citizenship, bringing their daughter home and keeping her here has turned into a struggle the two never imagined.\n\nGrowing up in Madison, Mize never thought he would have the family he dreamed about. As a gay teenager in the South in the 1990s, marrying a man he fell in love with and having a child together seemed out of reach.\n\nThen, in 2014, he met Gregg. Mize was living in New York after graduating law school. Gregg, who lived in Britain, was visiting the city on vacation. On their first date, Mize told Gregg how much he wanted children.\n\n\"I'm very, very, very Mississippi,\" Mize said Wednesday. \"I want the house with the front porch and two kids running around the yard. I want to go to church on Sunday and have a simple life.\"\n\nAs it turns out, the couple wanted the same things.\n\nA year later, they married.\n\n(Story continues after photo gallery.)\n\nU.S. policy affecting gay people more than others, father says\n\nTwo years after their first date, the couple started actively trying to have a baby. Last July, they welcomed daughter Simone, a dark-haired beauty that completely changed their lives. It looked like Mize was finally getting what he had long hoped for. But then the State Department delivered a crushing blow.\n\nDue to a decades-old policy, the U.S. is not recognizing Simone as an American citizen, even though both of her parents have American citizenship. The policy, and its consequences for the couple and others, continues to attract national headlines.\n\nWhile he was born and raised in Britain, Gregg's mother is an American, granting him dual citizenship. At the time of Simone's birth, Gregg had lived in the U.S. for four years. Under U.S. law, for a child born overseas to a non-married couple to be granted U.S. citizenship, their parent must have lived in the U.S. for five consecutive years, Mize said. Gregg was one year short.\n\nAs a result, Simone was denied U.S. citizenship.\n\n\"This is not a policy that is, on its face, directed at gay people,\" Mize said. \"It is, however, affecting gay people in a way that doesn't affect straight people.\"\n\nTalking to the Clarion Ledger from his home in Atlanta, Mize detailed what life has been like for the couple the last few years — from disappointments to joys in the IVF process, a health scare for Gregg and being told their daughter is viewed as child born out of wedlock by the U.S. government.\n\nFriend living in Britain agreed to be a surrogate\n\nWhen the couple started talking about having a baby, they made the decision to use a donor egg from an unknown woman. Both Mize and Gregg contributed their sperm and embryos were created.\n\nA friend of Gregg's, a British citizen, volunteered to be the surrogate. Gregg had introduced the woman to her husband years before and the couple had two children. She told Gregg since he had helped her start her family, she wanted to help him start his, Mize said.\n\nDuring the first round of IVF, the couple used the embryo with Mize's DNA. Unfortunately, the surrogate did not get pregnant. Then, they tried again, this time with the embryo with Gregg's DNA. It implanted.\n\n\"It's magical having a child,\" Mize said. \"I wake up every morning and it's like a little dream come true everyday.\"\n\nPassport to bring baby home raised 'red flags' with State Department\n\nAfter their daughter was born, the couple went through a number of legalities in Britain to prove Simone's birth using a surrogate had been done in an \"ethical way.\" When the courts signed off on Simone's birth certificate, Mize said, the judge cried. Simone was given a teddy bear and the couple thought they were well on their way to bringing their daughter home.\n\nBut, when they visited the embassy to get Simone's passport, they encountered questions Mize said they might not have faced if they had been a straight couple. Being two males, he said, was a \"red flag\" to the State Department. Officials probed into the details surrounding Simone's birth, specifically if a surrogate had been used.\n\nThey were told that, since a woman outside of the couple's marriage had carried Simone, the baby was born out of wedlock. Mize was not recognized as her father.\n\nIn an instant, Mize was transported back to being a child in Mississippi, to feeling like he didn't belong, like a family wasn't possible for him, he said.\n\n\"I never thought I could get married, have a house, any of those things,\" he said. \"I was teased a lot. In the last 10 years, we started to believe this is all over, we convinced society that our relationships matter, we convinced the Supreme Court that our marriages matter.\n\n\"We got married and bought a little house and had our daughter. And here we are, going to that little glass window and have someone tell me I'm not her father. It's like every emotion I ever had came rushing back to my body and it's like I was 8 years old all over again.\"\n\n'I'm her father, I really am'\n\nWhile Simone has Gregg's DNA, both parents are listed on her birth certificate. Mize noted that, in addition to surrogacy, families are made in a multitude of ways.\n\n\"What is a family?\" he asked. \"Are you not a family because you adopted? Are you not a family because you did IVF or used a surrogate? It doesn't mean I'm not Simone's father just because my sperm wasn't used.\n\n\"I put this little girl to bed every night, I get her up in the morning. There is no one, not even Johnny, who can make her stop crying the way I can. I'm her father, I really am.\"\n\nThe couple have completely baby proofed their Atlanta home. Simone is just learning to walk and so the couple's coffee table is covered in foam to protect the baby from hard edges. The electric outlets are covered and they steer her away from the stairs.\n\nTheir \"No. 1 concern\" is Simone's \"health and safety,\" Mize said. But they don't know how to protect her now. In April, the couple received the final word from the State Department: Simone was denied citizenship.\n\nTime daughter can be in U.S. limited\n\nSince she's not recognized as a citizen, Simone can only be in the U.S. for 90 days at a time and is not allowed to be in the country longer than six months. Currently, they are traveling back and forth on a tourist visa as the law requires, Mize said. But the logistics of that can be taxing.\n\n\"We can't just quit our jobs and move to England,\" he said.\n\nGregg needs to be in Atlanta. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor last year and underwent surgery in November. Eighty percent of the tumor was removed while 20 percent remains. He has regular MRIs to make sure the tumor isn't growing. As a result of the surgery, he lost part of his vision and no longer drives. He has therapy for his eyes every month.\n\n\"We've had a trying year,\" Mize said. \"God has been testing us.\"\n\nMize said the family could \"give up,\" leave the country and reenter with Simone as a \"registered legal alien and begin the green card process.\"\n\nBut the process is expensive and \"would take years,\" he said. So, instead, they've vowed to fight and explore their options, not just for their family but for others in similar situations.\n\n'We're just asking our government to have some understanding'\n\nFour people made the conscious decision to bring Simone into this world, \"to create a family from love,\" he said, \"so it just seems really ironic, in a bad way, that our government wants to be the party pooper here.\n\n\"We can't just sit back and hide and hope that things change,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about people who have to create their families in alternative ways and we're just asking for our government to have some understanding about that. Our child was created to be loved...we're going to take care of her no matter what.\"\n\nDo you want to stay informed on more topics like this one?

She had shot herself in the heart with their father’s hunting rifle weeks after their church excommunicated her for getting engaged to a man who was not a Jehovah’s Witness.\n\nFor Sawyer — who sat on the bedroom floor near her sister's body for hours that day, waiting for her mother to come home from her door-to-door missionary work — it was the beginning of a long, painful journey that would one day tear her family apart.\n\nYears later, Sawyer got excommunicated, too, after seeking a divorce from an abusive husband. She ended up leaving the husband — and the faith.\n\n► March 12:Kaylee Muthart explains what made her pull out her eyes\n\n► March 12:Oregon couple’s final days captured in intimate aid-in-dying video\n\n► Feb. 20:Did shunning from Jehovah's Witnesses drive mom to murder-suicide?\n\nHer family cut all ties.\n\n“Jehovah’s Witness kids grow up knowing that if they ever mess up, their parents will leave them — and that’s scary,” Sawyer, now 38, said in a recent interview from her home in Pascagoula, Miss. “The shunning is supposed to make us miss them so much that we’ll come back. … It didn’t work.”\n\nSawyer and many others like her now are denouncing the church's shunning practices in wake of a recent murder-suicide in Keego Harbor, Mich., that killed a family of four former Jehovah’s Witnesses who were ostracized after leaving the faith.\n\n► Feb. 11:As details of Burning Man suicide emerge, family grieves anew\n\n► Dec. 13: Lawmaker dies of suicide days after being accused of sexual abuse\n\nThe deaths sparked outrage among scores of ex-practitioners of the faith nationwide who took to Facebook, online forums, blogs and YouTube, arguing that the tragedy highlights a pervasive yet rarely publicized problem within the church: Shunning is pushing the most vulnerable people over the edge and tearing families apart, they say.\n\nIn the Michigan case, a distraught mother shot and killed her husband, her two grown children and herself in their home about 25 miles northwest of Detroit, shocking the small and quiet community.\n\nThey chose to leave\n\nThe shooter was Lauren Stuart, a part-time model and personal trainer who struggled with depression and spent much of her time working on her house, her friends said. She and her husband, Daniel Stuart, 47, left the Jehovah's Witnesses faith more than a decade ago over doctrinal and social issues.\n\nAmong them was their desire to send their kids to college, which many former Jehovah's Witnesses say the church frowns and views as spiritually dangerous.\n\n“University and college campuses are notorious for bad behavior​ — drug and alcohol abuse, immorality, cheating, hazing, and the list goes on,” read an Oct. 1, 2005, article in Watchtower, the church's official publication that is not available online until 2008 editions.\n\n► Nov. 20:How other countries can help us understand U.S. mass shooting crisis\n\n► Oct. 14:Mom kills 2 sons, herself. But why did she do it?\n\nThe Stuarts sent both their kids to college: Steven Stuart, 27, excelled in computers, just like his father, who was a data solutions architect for the University of Michigan Medical School. Bethany Stuart, 24, thrived in art and graphic design.\n\nAfter the parents left the faith, the Stuarts were ostracized by the members of the Kingdom Hall — the churches where Jehovah's Witnesses worship — in nearby Union Lake, Mich., and their families, friends said.\n\nLauren Stuart, whose mother died of cancer when she was 12, struggled with mental illness that went untreated, isolation and fears that the end was near, friends and officials familiar with the case said. One friend who requested anonymity said she believes the killing was the result of depression, not religion.\n\nLongtime family friend Joyce Taylor, 58, of White Lake, Mich., believes depression, shunning and religion-based doomsday fears all played a role. She said that about six weeks before the killings, Lauren Stuart started getting religiously preoccupied and telling her, \"It's the end times. I know it is.\"\n\nWeeks later, Taylor saw her friend again. Lauren Stuart had a vacant look in her eyes.\n\nShe was emotionally distressed.\n\nA week later, with her home decorated for Valentine's Day, Lauren Stuart killed her family. She left behind a suicide note.\n\n\"She said in the suicide note that she felt that by killing them it was the only way to save them,\" recalled Taylor, who said police let her read the letter. \"She said she's sorry that she has to do this, but it was the only way to save them all.\"\n\nTaylor, a former Jehovah's Witness herself who left the faith in 1986, explained: \"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that if you die on this side of Armageddon, you'll be resurrected in paradise.\"\n\n► June 1:Persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia intensifies\n\n► April 20:Russian court bans Jehovah's Witnesses as extremist group\n\nIn Lauren Stuart's case, Taylor believes her friend never deprogrammed after leaving the church — a state she describes as \"physically out, but mentally in.\" She believes that Lauren Stuart's indoctrinated doomsday fears never left her and that the shunning helped push her over the edge.\n\nIf her tight-knit community that once was her entire support system had not excommunicated her — and left her with no one to share her fears with — Lauren Stuart may not have done what she did, Taylor believes.\n\n\"People do things when they are desperate,\" Taylor said. \"And that was an extreme, desperate act.\"\n\nShunning \"can lead to great trauma among people because the Jehovah's Witnesses are a very tight-knit community,\" said Mathew Schmalz, a religious studies associate professor at the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.\n\n\"If you're separated out, you're really left to your own devices in ways that are very challenging and very painful,\" Schmalz said. \"Once you leave a group that's been your whole life, letting that go is a kind of death.\"\n\nPolice have not yet disclosed details about the death of the Stuart family except for calling it a murder-suicide.\n\nThe tragedy has emboldened many once-quiet ex-Jehovah's Witnesses to speak up. Many say they suffered quietly on their own for years until they discovered an online community full of isolated, ostracized people like themselves — people who had lost someone to suicide or attempted suicide themselves because their families, friends and church community had written them off for making mistakes, for being human.\n\nThe church calls it being \"disfellowshipped.\" Members can return if they repent, change the behavior and prove themselves worthy of being reinstated. But unless or until that happens, members are encouraged to avoid the sinners, especially those who leave the faith.\n\nMothers go years, even decades, without talking to their children.\n\nSiblings write off siblings.\n\nFriends shun friends.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses are disfellowshipped every year — roughly 1% of the church’s total population, according to data published by the Watchtower.\n\n► April 12:Body of judge on New York's highest court found in Hudson River\n\n► January 2017:Michigan officers stop suicide just in time\n\nTheir names are published at local Kingdom Halls. Of those, two-thirds never return.\n\nHowever, within a faith representing 8.4 million people worldwide, many members believe the religion is pure, good and loving. Those who are speaking against it are disgruntled and angry people who have an ax to grind because they were disfellowshipped, current members argue.\n\nOr, they are lost souls who have misinterpreted the meaning and love behind the faith. Members say they believe that the shunning accusations are exaggerated and the suicides are often more about mental illness than ostracism.\n\n► June 2016:Mom who stabbed self killed her three sons first, police say\n\n► June 2016:Is there a psychology of hate we need to understand better?\n\nMany of those who have left the religion disagree.\n\nIn the world of ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses, they maintain that the shunned are considered dead to their families, just like the suicide victims.\n\nThese are their stories.\n\n‘A dangerous cult’\n\nThe conversation was difficult to wrap her 8-year-old brain around.\n\n“You know your sister was being bad, right?“ Sawyer recalled her mother telling her after her sister's suicide.\n\n“And what she did was stupid, right?’ … To take your own life is very wrong,\" her mother continued.\n\n“I didn’t understand what was going on … and I said, ‘Oh. OK,’ “ Sawyer recalled. “In my 8-year-old brain, I was thinking, ‘When I mess up, my mom’s going to hate me.’ \"\n\nAnd so began her painful journey with the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith, the religion she was born into and grew up in in Pascagoula, Miss., where her fears of abandonment took hold at age 8.\n\n► March 2016:Former Army Reservist kills family, self\n\n► March 2016:Cannabis church founder says he was defamed\n\nSawyer believes that the shunning drove her sister to suicide. After the church disfellowshipped her for getting engaged to a non-Jehovah's Witness, the fiancé left, and her sister was thrown into depression.\n\nHer sister tried turning to her mother for consolation. But her mom would read scripture and tell her, \"Until you start acting right, you’re going to have these bad things happen to you.“\n\nBad things happened to Sawyer, too.\n\nAt 30, she sought a divorce from her husband because he was abusive and cheating on her, she said. But church elders and family pressured her to save her marriage.\n\n“I showed them the holes in my walls,” Sawyer said, referring to the damage her ex-husband did to the home during fights. “They told me to pray more … and sent me back home to him.”\n\nSawyer took up smoking to handle the stress, which got her disfellowshipped because smoking is not allowed.\n\nShe also went through with the divorce. She ended up losing her home to foreclosure and turned to her mother for help because she had two children to raise.\n\nHer mother took her in temporarily, but when church elders found out, they threatened to shun Sawyer’s mother. Her mother let the grandkids stay but not her daughter.\n\nSawyer ended up homeless for six months, living out of her car in a community college parking lot.\n\nShe landed on her feet with the help of a student loan. She got an apartment, a job as a hospice nurse and her children — now 10 and 18 — back.\n\nShe found herself but lost her family along the way.\n\n► January 2016:Dad likely torched home with gasoline\n\n► December 2015:Minister stripping away church knowledge gap on mental health\n\nHer mother doesn’t speak to her. Sawyer said she can’t recall the last time they spoke.\n\nHer sister in Alabama hasn’t spoken to her since Sawyer got divorced in 2010.\n\n“She was on my porch with my parents,\" Sawyer said. \"My sister looked at me and said, ‘You’re abandoning me just like Donna did’ and left. And that's the last thing she ever said to me.\"\n\nSawyer has kept silent about her pain for decades.\n\n“This is a dangerous cult,” she said of her former religion. “It’s important for people to realize. This is serious.”\n\nHe lost his daughter\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2011, the Utah church of Dave Gracey disfellowshipped him at age 61.\n\nBy then, he had been an elder three times — a job that troubled him as he often found himself judging and sanctioning people who had sinned in the eyes of the church: Smokers. Drug users. Adulterers. Homosexuals.\n\n“I had a terrible time with that,” Gracey said. “All we were doing was chasing people around and catching them in their sins and kicking them out.”\n\nBut then came the day the church judged his own children. That's when Gracey said he started rebelling.\n\nIn 2010, Gracey’s 38-year-old daughter, Laura, committed suicide after a fallout with church elders.\n\n► September 2015:Town comes together for funeral of family shot by dad\n\n► February 2015:Missouri candidate dies of self-inflicted gunshot wound\n\n“It put me in an absolute rage,” he recalled.\n\nGracey's daughter was rebellious growing up and suffered from mental illness, he said. She got into drugs and became homeless at one point but tried to get her life in order.\n\nAt 33, she was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness and over the next four years she was disfellowshipped twice and reinstated twice.\n\nBut in January 2010, following a meeting with church elders, Gracey's daughter fatally overdosed on prescription medication. She had been living in an apartment complex with other Jehovah's Witnesses in California and had a medical marijuana card for anxiety and stress.\n\nGracey suspects his daughter told the elders about the card.\n\n“The elders won’t tell me why they met with her,” Gracey said. “Obviously, she was distressed that night, and they left her alone. They knew how fragile my daughter was. … It’s my guess that they excommunicated her that night, but they won’t tell me. They failed to protect her in her most vulnerable state.”\n\nThat same year, Gracey would suffer more heartache at the hands of his church. His 14-year-old stepdaughter had been raped, but the elders didn’t believe her, he said.\n\nAn investigation followed and an administrative judge and child protective services made a finding that the Jehovah's Witnesses were guilty of child maltreatment.\n\nThe church mounted a campaign to oust the Graceys of Layton, Utah, who appealed to the Jehovah’s Witnesses' headquarters in Warwick, N.Y., in the New York City metro area, claiming the church had harmed their daughter.\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2011, the Graceys were excommunicated.\n\n“We were so indoctrinated. We had difficulty with it,” Gracey said, noting he and his wife officially left the faith in March 2013 after getting shunned repeatedly.\n\n► January 2015:Parents killed selves, kids fearing apocalypse\n\n► July 2013:Rick Warren returns to pulpit after son's suicide\n\n“I walked out and never came back,” Gracey said. “I started kind of waking up.”\n\nGracey, who considers himself agnostic now, is focused on helping all of his family escape the Jehovah's Witnesses organization.\n\n“I want to expose this religion for what they really are. It is a cult that splits up families and separates people from life. … They seem nice on Saturday morning when they are peddling their Watchtower, but they are insidious.”\n\n‘I’ve been sick over this'\n\nFor Californian Kerry Kaye, the Keego Harbor killings triggered a host of emotions: anger, pain, frustration.\n\nShe, too, is a former member of the Jehovah's Witnesses community and lost a very good friend to suicide more than 20 years ago.\n\n“I’ve just been sick over this. It brings back a lot of memories,” Kaye said of the Michigan killings in a recent telephone interview.\n\nKaye was in her early 20s when her friend committed suicide after being disfellowshipped for getting pregnant out of wedlock. The woman was 20 years old and seven months pregnant at the time.\n\nKaye said her friend tried to get back into the church, but the elders told her, “No, you need more time. You’re not qualified to come back.“\n\n► July 2013:Indiana mom, 2 kids' drowning deaths called accident\n\n► May 2013:Man commits suicide inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral\n\nThat day, the friend went home and shot herself in the heart, Kaye said.\n\n“If you’re in the organization, you understand the depression and despair,” said Kaye, who explained that when someone gets disfellowshipped, word spreads fast in the church. She admits that she once shunned her own father at the direction of the church.\n\n“The moment they make an announcement, you’re not allowed to have contact with them whatsoever. You have to pretend they’re dead,” Kaye said. “That’s how they control the people. It’s a fear tactic. It’s to keep them in the cult, under their control.”\n\nKaye was 24 when she left the church. Her father had left the faith a few years earlier after the church pressured him to leave his government job, telling him he had to choose the faith or his work.\n\nHe picked the job and disassociated himself.\n\nKaye was forced to shun her father or face consequences, she said.\n\n“I didn’t talk to my father for almost two years, and then I finally had enough,” Kaye said. “I started to try to make an escape.”\n\nIt wasn’t easy. After she left, she said she became suicidal.\n\nDoctors intervened and saved her life, she said. Eventually, she moved away from her hometown to the Los Angeles area to raise her three children on her own, outside the organization.\n\nThey are all college educated now and thriving, she said. And she has found peace as she has dedicated herself to helping others who feel trapped in the denomination.\n\n“I’m wonderful since I left,” Kaye said. “My mission is to help other people. When entire families are destroyed, it makes all of us who have been involved in this cult very angry. We want people to know what is really going on.”\n\n‘We love everyone’\n\nAlmost 8.5 million people are Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, including 1.2 million in the United States, according to the JW.org website.\n\nWe come from hundreds of ethnic and language backgrounds, yet we are united by common goals. Above all, we want to honor Jehovah, the God of the Bible and the Creator of all things. We do our best to imitate Jesus Christ and are proud to be called Christians. Each of us regularly spends time helping people learn about the Bible and God’s Kingdom. Because we witness, or talk, about Jehovah God and his Kingdom, we are known as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nThe Jehovah’s Witnesses national organization did not return calls and e-mails from the Free Press for comment on the subject of disfellowshipping. Multiple members and elders were contacted, but all declined to speak on the record, many saying they were not authorized to publicly comment on scripture and church teachings.\n\nHowever, following the Keego Harbor killings, numerous current Jehovah’s Witnesses contacted the Free Press to defend their religion, stressing it is about unconditional love, peace, helping people and having an unwavering commitment to God and Jesus Christ.\n\nBut like many religions, Jehovah's Witnesses have rules to follow — such as no stealing, killing, committing adultery, smoking or getting intoxicated on alcohol or drugs. If one commits any of these acts, they can be disfellowshipped, but they can get back in if they truly repent and change their behavior.\n\nThey, too, did not want to have their names published.\n\nMisunderstood denomination\n\nSchmalz, the religious studies professor, said mainstream Christians often misunderstand the Jehovah's Witnesses' faith. Their beliefs may seem \"unorthodox\" to other religious groups and their rules too strict or extreme.\n\nBut Jehovah's Witnesses, a Protestant denomination that began in the 1870s as a Bible study group in Pittsburgh, have rational reasons for much of what they believe and do, he said.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe in a \"great cataclysm,\" that \" 'the end is near' is continually imminent,\" he said. When you are brought up with that belief within a strong and tightly knit religious setting, it is hard to shake.\n\n► April 2013:Churches shed light on suicide, depression\n\n► April 2013:Pastor Rick Warren blames son's death on depression\n\n\"This belief in Armageddon, which is central to the Jehovah's Witness worldview, is something that still retains its power — even for people who have left,\" said Schmalz, who teaches a course in modern religious movements with discussions about Jehovah's Witnesses and Scientology. Author L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology in the early 1950s in Los Angeles.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses aren't alone in the practice of shunning, Schmalz said. The Amish and other Mennonite groups ostracize those who leave the faith, too.\n\nHe said Jehovah's Witnesses have two goals in mind when they disfellowship someone:\n\n1. They need a mechanism to discipline people who don't abide by their tenets.\n\n2. They are trying to create a pure community whose members adhere to the group's beliefs and tenets.\n\nThis practice can be harmful, he said. But members have a rationale for the behavior.\n\n\"How is disfellowshipping really that different from tough love, where you hold people accountable for their actions? It's a complicated question,\" said Schmalz, who is opposed to using the word \"cult\" to describe the Jehovah's Witness church.\n\n\"We should look at the Jehovah's Witnesses not as a bizarre religious group but as a religion that has its own internal means of discipline,\" he said. \"They can be very harsh and have very unintended and tragic consequences.\"\n\nFollow Tresa Baldas on Twitter: @Tbaldas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/op-ed/lindavaldez/2017/07/21/kids-before-marriage-becoming-norm-and-thats-not-good/498220001/", "title": "Kids before marriage is becoming the norm (and that's not good)", "text": "What’s wrong with America?\n\nEverybody has an answer these days.\n\nIs it the politicians? Naw. That's too easy. They are just ugly symptoms of a sinking society.\n\nIf you want to one clear sign of distress, look to the maternity wards. Look to the normalization of unwed motherhood.\n\nThis isn’t a rap against women. It’s a plea for the children. It's a call for responsibility.\n\nThis is about all of us. It’s about how what used to be aberrational became commonplace.\n\nKids before marriage was not the norm\n\nIn 1974, Tom Waits sang about a “solitary sailor, who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers.”\n\nWaits’ “Ghosts of Saturday Night” song was about a gritty world and marginalized people.\n\nIt was a place where the comfortable suburban crowd would have been most uncomfortable, which is probably what made it attractive to the children of those upstanding folks who lived in cookie-cutter houses.\n\nWe loved anti-heroes and rebels.\n\nBut let’s face it, we knew that solitary sailor was not supposed to be a role model. We knew deep in our middle-class hearts that nice guys were preferable to bad boys – especially when it came to marriage.\n\nAnd marriage was still a prerequisite to children.\n\n40% of births now involve unwed moms\n\nIn 1974, only 13.2 percent of all births were to unwed mothers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn 2015, the figure was 40.3% of all births, which the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics says represents the seventh consecutive year that birthrates to unmarried women have declined.\n\nIn 1940, the rate was 3.8%.\n\nI don’t want to return to those days when women had few choices and domestic violence was a man’s prerogative.\n\nThings are better now. No woman has to follow a pattern set by a patriarchy. No woman has to have a baby, either.\n\nMillennials and marriage don't mix\n\nBut a whopping 55% of 28- to 34-year-old millennials choose to have their first child before marriage, according to a report released in June by the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for Family Studies.\n\nFifty-five percent.\n\nIt’s a selfish decision that will cost them and their children.\n\nThose who have children before or instead of marriage are more likely to wind up in poverty than their peers who follow what’s called the “success sequence,” the report says. That sequence is: Get an education and a job before getting married and having a kid.\n\nWhy having a baby before marriage matters\n\nThe children also will pay a price for their parents’ lack of planning and responsibility.\n\nWe should all care about that. We all pay if kids fail at school because poverty or a lack of stability at home weighs them down with burdens they are too young to carry.\n\nMarriage before kids helps a family prosper. Kids benefit from families, which include a couple (same-sex or heterosexual) that has made a formal commitment to work together to share the enormous job of raising children.\n\nALLHANDS:Why a lesbian divorce case could redefine parenthood\n\nWhy are so many young people carelessly rejecting this time-honored way to nurture kids?\n\nDon't blame baby boomers for this\n\nDon’t blame my generation.\n\nDespite all the bad-boy hero movies I grew up with, despite the drug-soaked music lyrics, despite the “question authority” bumper stickers, I understand that having a child is about more than self-fulfillment and doing what feels good.\n\nMaybe the boomers got something out of all that Ozzie and Harriet nonsense in the 1950 and 1960s. It was stereotypical slop. But those sitcom couples were better role models than a bunch of dysfunctional people screaming obscenities at each other on reality TV.\n\nI don't know how we got here.

It was a time when White judges and politicians talked openly about protecting the \"purity and integrity of the white race\" and the evils of \"race-mixing\" and miscegenation -- a pejorative term for intimate relations between people of different races.\n\nThat all began to change in June of 1967 when the US Supreme Court unanimously struck down an anti-miscegenation law in the Loving v. Virginia case. The case concerned the marriage between a white man, Richard Loving, and his wife, Mildred Jeter, a woman of Black and Native American ancestry.\n\nThe Loving case did more than make interracial marriage legal nationwide -- it helped spark a mini social revolution. When a Gallup poll first asked Americans about their views on marriage between Black and White people in 1958, only 4% approved. Last year, that number was 94% — an all-time high -- with 93% of Whites saying they approved.\n\nThis dramatic shift represents a rare moment of racial progress that's equally embraced by a vast majority of White and Black Americans. But it also begs a question that's rarely, if ever, asked:\n\nWhy have Americans reached a consensus on interracial marriage when other racial issues, like affirmative action and integration, remain fiercely contested?\n\nInterracial marriage is viewed differently than other racial issues\n\nThat question has taken on new urgency because interracial marriage is back in the news. People across the globe recently celebrated \"Loving Day,\" the 55th anniversary of the Loving decision, which declared prohibitions on interracial marriage unconstitutional.\n\nA recent Supreme Court decision also raised new questions about interracial marriage. Some legal experts warn the same legal rationale the high court's conservative majority recently used to overturn Roe v. Wade in its Dobbs decision could be applied to overturn Loving v. Virginia.\n\n\"To those who say Loving v. Virginia will never be overturned, be cautious and vigilant,\" said the American Civil Liberties Union in a statement after the Roe decision. \"The United States has a long history of criminalizing, surveilling, and controlling Black and brown families and the mixing of races.''\n\nAny concerns about the durability of interracial marriage, though, may seem far-fetched to some because it's such an entrenched part of American life.\n\nThere was a time when interracial couples and their children had to hide in shame. Not anymore.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is one of many prominent Americans who are the product of interracial marriages. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is White.\n\nAdvertisements today routinely depict interracial couples, straight and gay, along with their children. Biracial public figures such as filmmaker Jordan Peele, NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama are heroes to millions of Americans.\n\nThe advertisers are following demographic trends. People who identity as multiracial increased by 276% over the last decade, according to the 2020 census.\n\nWhen Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in last week as the first Black female justice on the Supreme Court, she did so while standing next to her husband, who is White. His race was not even noted in the stories on her swearing-in.\n\nSo how did such an enormous shift in acceptance occur?\n\nCNN put this question to several authors and scholars who not only study race but are biracial themselves. One of them is Lise Funderburg, author of \" Black, White, Other: Biracial Americans Talk About Race and Identity .\" Funderburg was born before the Loving decision to a Black father and White mother who married and raised her in Philadelphia.\n\nFunderburg says the difference between attitudes about interracial marriage and other racial issues like voting rights is one word: proximity.\n\n\"You can dehumanize people when they are just abstract concepts to you,\" she says. \"Affirmative action, voting rights—these are issues that you can depersonalize. But you can't depersonalize your cousin's husband at the barbecue who asks you to pass the ketchup. It's hard to dismiss or take a stance against love when it's in your face.\"\n\nGeorge and Marjorie Funderburg relax on their porch in an undated photo. Their daughter, Lise, went on to write a landmark book about biracial Americans.\n\nThe importance of physical proximity in bridging racial divisions is backed up by social science. There's a name for this dynamic. It's called \" contact theory .\" This term was coined by Gordon Allport , one of the 20th century's towering psychologists. Allport said that racial prejudice against Black people could decrease among White Americans if the two groups had interpersonal contact.\n\nIn one of his most famous studies, Allport conducted surveys of White soldiers who fought alongside Black soldiers during World War II. He discovered that in companies with both Black and White platoons, White soldiers disliked Black people far less than did White soldiers who served in segregated units.\n\nBut Allport found it was not enough for Whites and non-Whites to simply know one another. Other conditions also had to be met, such as personal interaction, equal status and both groups sharing common goals. Allport's findings, which were replicated with civilians in varying settings, proved that hatred and racism stem from lack of contact—or physical proximity.\n\nWhy many White Americans aren't threatened by interracial unions\n\nThere could be another reason why so many White Americans now accept marriage between Black and White people: They don't perceive it as a threat to their status or economic well-being, one scholar says.\n\nOmar Wasow is one of the leading voices on race in America. An assistant professor of politics at University of California, Berkeley, he is the author of a groundbreaking paper that revealed how violent and nonviolent civil rights protests in the 1960s shaped media coverage and influenced voting patterns. Wasow is also the son of a White man and Black woman who met in college and married in 1968, a year after the Loving v. Virginia decision.\n\nOmar Wasow, a political scientist and researcher, with his parents, Bernard and Eileen. Wasow's parents were married a year after the landmark Loving v. Virginia decision.\n\nWasow says interracial marriage is more widely accepted by White people now because many don't perceive it as a threat to their economic or political power.\n\nBy contrast, many White Americans believe their property values will decrease if \"too many\" Black people — usually more than a handful — move into their neighborhood. Whites move out so often when this happens that sociologists have a name for the phenomenon. It's called \" racial tipping .\"\n\nA similar dynamic takes place in public schools. If more than a small number of Black students enroll in a school, many White parents withdraw their children, fearing they will receive an inferior education or start making lower test scores.\n\nThese are some reasons why schools and housing remain heavily segregated in the US, despite increased racial diversity in many suburbs.\n\n\"Granting legal equality is often easier to achieve than issues that try to get at material or political equality, where there is something quite valuable that is being allocated and people feel not just a loss of some symbol but a genuine sense of a loss of power, or a threat to their material well-being,\" Wasow says.\n\nStudents write positive affirmations on poster board at P.S. 5 Port Morris, an elementary school in the Bronx borough of New York City, on August 17, 2021. The school system is one of the nation's largest and most segregated.\n\nAn issue like affirmative action is a prime example of that dynamic, he says.\n\n\"Affirmative action is a more demanding ask of a white majority than something like interracial marriage because there's no sense of, if these people get married, I'm denying an opportunity to myself,\" Wasow says. \"Granting people the legal right to marry has no material cost to people who had that right but were denying it to others.\n\n\"There's a sense of status loss and a change in social order, but if people of different races couldn't get married before and now they can, the person who is a bigot doesn't have their wealth threatened in any meaningful way.\"\n\nEven so, many challenges remain for interracial couples\n\nAlthough interracial couples are more common in the US today, challenges remain for them and their children.\n\nIn 2013, Cheerios pulled comments from its YouTube page after the cereal brand ran a TV commercial featuring an interracial family and their daughter. The ad triggered an onslaught of racist comments , including warnings of \"racial genocide\" and viewers who said they were so disgusted by the commercial that they \"want to vomit.\"\n\nA screenshot from a 2013 Cheerios commercial that depicted an interracial family.\n\nAnd in March, a Republican senator from Indiana said he would be open to the Supreme Court overturning the Loving v. Virginia decision and leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states. The senator, GOP Sen. Mike Braun, later apologized after receiving public criticism, and said he condemned \"racism in any form.\"\n\nSuch reactions come as no surprise to Kaitlyn Wells , an author who is biracial. Wells, 35, was born decades after the Loving decision to a Black man and White woman.\n\n\"I wouldn't exist if it weren't for Loving,\" she says, referring to the Supreme Court decision which paved the way for her parents to marry. \"But the world didn't magically accept interracial couples on June 12, 1967, when the case was decided,\" Wells says. \"There are still people who believe we shouldn't be here.\"\n\nAfter she married recently, Wells posted a picture on Facebook of her father walking her down the aisle. A White Facebook user, apparently assuming she was White and her father was her husband, posted: \"That is sick. Going to be one of these women with a half breed baby and divorced and trying to find probably another white person.\"\n\nWells says she constantly runs into strangers who take liberties to touch her hair or ask her intrusive questions about her racial identity.\n\n\"It's just this constant thing -- they want to put you in a box,\" she says. \"They want to be able to figure out who you are and where you come from.\"\n\nKaitlyn Wells wrote \"A Family Looks Like Love\" for biracial kids like herself.\n\nWells was so distressed by the treatment she received that she wrote a children's book for biracial kids titled, \" A Family Looks Like Love .\"\n\n\"If I had a book like this when I was a kid, it would have made some of those conversations with my parents a little bit easier,\" she says.\n\nA question no poll has answered\n\nDespite the experiences of people like Wells, it's hard not to be encouraged by the dramatic shift in public opinion on interracial marriage. Not long ago, a Black man could get lynched for flirting with a White woman in public. Today few raise eyebrows at interracial couples.\n\nCould the same dynamic that occurred with interracial marriage shift to other racial issues?\n\nFunderburg, the author, asks similar questions after looking at the recent Gallup poll and considering recent Supreme Court decisions that have gutted the Voting Rights Act and weakened gun control laws.\n\nDemonstrators protest for voting rights outside the US Supreme Court in Washington on June 23, 2021.\n\n\"I do think this statistic points to the power of personal experience to dissolve prejudice and to dismantle hate,\" she says. \"But we're looking at this statistic right now in an era when the number of rights that I thought were solid and sacred are being reversed. That drive for a draconian dismantling of a whole range of civil rights is underway in so many realms of America.\"\n\nThis is a question that no contemporary poll has answered.\n\nWhile more White Americans are now welcoming Black people into their families, many are still not willing to accept them in their neighborhoods or in their public schools.\n\nAs long as there is little contact between White and non-White Americans in those settings, the power of personal experience to dissolve prejudice will remain moot. Unless there are more personal relationships between White people, Black people and others in those spaces, we will continue to live with a paradox spawned by the Loving decision:\n\nAmericans' personal lives are more integrated than ever. But in the public realm — when it comes to issues like political power, housing and education — some White Americans are still living by the motto that guided their predecessors in the era before the Loving decision:\n\n\"No race-mixing allowed.\"", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/economy/china-population-data-2021-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's birth rate drops for a fifth straight year to record low - CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world.

Contemporarily, \"at least in the US, about 20% to 30% of women retain their name, meaning the vast majority take their spouse's name when they marry,\" Carr said. That includes artist Jennifer Lopez, who recently confirmed her marriage to actor Ben Affleck with the signature \"Mrs. Jennifer Lynn Affleck.\"\n\n\"Women may take their husband's name legally,\" Carr said, \"but professionally, I would bet she will continue to perform under the name of J. Lo. Sometimes people take their husband's name legally, but professionally, they may still use their maiden name.\"\n\nIt wasn't until legal changes and a booming feminist movement in the 1970s that there was a big push to keep one's last name, Carr said. That tendency dipped during the 1980s, a more conservative era, and has fluctuated since the 1990s, she added.\n\nThe decision to retain or forgo one's name can still be influenced by economic, familial, social, romantic and religious factors -- especially when children are involved.\n\nBearing a new name\n\nFor some people, adopting a spouse's name is a \"public statement to the world that you are, in fact, a couple,\" Carr said. \"I think the other is social pressure. It may come from the spouse, but it might come from family. And women will often get pushback -- whether from their parents or their in-laws -- about why you're not taking the name. Some people believe it means that you're not as committed to the union.\"\n\nInertia or tradition are other reasons, Carr said. \"Some things have just always been done, and so people don't question them. They don't counter them,\" Carr said. \"It's kind of the path of least resistance.\"\n\nSome people might be keen to get rid of their family name because of a desire to somehow separate themselves from their biological parents, said Joshua Coleman, a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, California, and a senior fellow with the Council on Contemporary Families.\n\n\"Somebody who wasn't close to their parents or felt hurt by them (and) didn't really like being identified as a Smith or a Jones or whomever, would welcome the idea of a new surname that wasn't their own,\" he added.\n\nWomen who believe in gender equality yet take on their husband's name might think that the name change doesn't mean they are ceding away any of their authority as a woman, Coleman said.\n\n\"The woman doesn't see herself in some kind of subordination to the husband or ceding any of her power or authority or identity or individuality. She likes the tradition of it, but that doesn't mean that she buys into all of the things that may have gone with it traditionally,\" he added.\n\nin any form were more likely to be less educated. Very rarely does a husband adopt his wife's surname. In a 2018 study of 877 men, 3% (27 men) had changed their name once married. Of those 27 men, 25 had dropped their last name entirely; two hyphenated their name. Men who changed their namein any form were more likely to be less educated.\n\n\"That's probably some kind of a persistence of misogyny or patriarchy or something in that camp -- that the idea of a man taking on his wife's last name would be somehow considered problematic,\" Coleman said.\n\nThere isn't much research about marriage-related name changes among couples on the LGBTQ+ spectrum.\n\n\"I think part of the reason there isn't that much data is because legal same sex marriage is still pretty new,\" Carr said. \"I suspect they may be more likely to hyphenate or to come up with something because of this egalitarianism that tends to happen -- you don't have this gendered history here.\"\n\nRetaining identity\n\nAmong the 20% to 30% of women who don't follow tradition, the most common practice is keeping their own surname, followed by hyphenation, making a hybrid name or, even more rarely, coming up with a totally new shared name, Carr said.\n\nFor some women, keeping their surname is preserving the personal and familial identity they have always had, Carr said. \"That could be tied to their parents, tied to their ethnic or racial heritage -- names are very meaningful.\"\n\nPractically, some people have established a professional identity, especially those in very visible positions such as writers, academics or celebrities. If their name is key to their profession, that's something they might not be willing to give up, she added.\n\nKeeping one's surname can also be a political act, often done by those who adhere to feminist beliefs and practices, Carr said -- such as independence and equal partnership. Some question why one name should take privilege over the other, and if using just one spouse's name would convey an unequal partnership.\n\nThe prevalence of retaining one's last name is greater among women with higher levels of education and older women, Carr said. \"They have more professional identity built by that point,\" she said, whereas younger women have fewer professional ties and might be more susceptible to family pressure.\n\nHaving children can complicate things.\n\n\"It's very rare that both partners would choose the woman's name,\" Carr said. \"Overwhelmingly, if they choose one name, it's the one that belongs to the husband.\"\n\nMany believe that using one spouse's last name is easier socially and legally, Carr said.\n\n\"People know what to call you,\" she said. Using one name can also prevent \"administrative headaches\" that can come up when it comes to things like booking flights, insurance, health care and who's allowed to pick up a child from school, she added.\n\nParents who don't use one surname for the entire family \"have to do a lot more work and a lot of explanations,\" Carr said, \"because a lot of our structures are not set up to accommodate innovating naming practices.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe decision to use the husband's name sometimes derives from the fact \"that there's maternal certainty,\" Carr said. \"We know who gives birth, but there's not always paternal certainty. And given that nonmarital births are still stigmatized, I think, historically, that's a reason why the couple would go with the male name.\"\n\nCombining surnames in some fashion can be a way of preserving one's identity as a member of their original family and as an individual, while also having an identity as a member of a new family, Coleman said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}]}

She was 73.\n\n\"Dame Olivia Newton-John passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time,\" her husband, John Easterling, wrote in a statement on the singer's verified Instagram account. \"Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.\"\n\nThe singer revealed in September 2018 that she was treating cancer at the base of her spine. It was her third cancer diagnosis, following bouts with breast cancer in the early '90s and in 2017.\n\nHer rise to fame\n\nThanks to a string of country and soft-rock hits, Newton-John was already a popular singer by the late 1970s. But her co-starring role opposite John Travolta in 1978's \"Grease,\" arguably the most popular movie musical of all time, lifted her to a new level of stardom.\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Travolta in 1978 in 'Grease.'\n\nAlthough she had little acting experience (and turned 29 during filming), Newton-John gave an indelible performance as Sandy, a sweet-natured Australian transfer student who romances Travolta's alpha greaser Danny at a Southern California high school in the 1950s.\n\nTheir onscreen chemistry as mismatched lovebirds who undergo final-act makeovers to win each others' hearts -- she ditches her frilly dresses for heels, leather, spandex and a cigarette -- anchored the movie and inspired repeat viewings by legions of fans.\n\n\"I don't think anyone could have imagined a movie would go on almost 40 years and would still be popular and people would still be talking to me about it all the time and loving it,\" Newton-John told CNN in 2017 . \"It's just one of those movies. I'm very lucky to have been a part of it. It's given so many people pleasure.\"\n\nNewton-John sang on three of the movie's biggest hits: the duets \"You're The One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights\" with Travolta, and her swoony solo ballad, \"Hopelessly Devoted To You.\"\n\nBorn in Cambridge, England in 1948, Newton-John moved with her family to Melbourne, Australia , when she was five. After winning a talent contest on a TV show, \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" as a teen she formed an all-girl group and began appearing on weekly pop music programs in Australia.\n\nNewton-John recorded her first single in England in 1966 and scored a few international hits, but she remained largely unknown to US audiences until 1973, when \"Let Me Be There\" became a top-10 hit on both the adult contemporary and the country charts.\n\nA series of No. 1 easy-listening hits followed, including \"I Honestly Love You,\" \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" and \"Please Mr. Please.\"\n\nThen came \"Grease,\" which was 1978's top-grossing movie and became an enduring cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe movie gave Newton-John an opportunity to change her squeaky-clean image. The cover of her next album, \"Totally Hot,\" featured the singer in black leather, while its songs had an edgier, more contemporary pop sound.\n\nHer singing success\n\nIn 1981, she took her new, sexier persona a step further with \"Physical,\" a dance number with such suggestive lyrics as, \"There's nothing left to talk about unless it's horizontally.\" Banned by several radio stations, it became her biggest hit, spending 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOlivia Newton-John performing on the BBC TV music show 'Top Of The Pops' in 1974.\n\nShe also appeared in several more big-budget movies, including the musical fantasy \"Xanadu\" with Hollywood legend Gene Kelly in his final screen role.

She is morning editor at Katie Couric Media. She tweets @HolstaT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) I was pretty disappointed the first time I saw Olivia Newton-John out of character. An inauspicious opening to a eulogy perhaps, but let me explain: It was 1998, and I was 10 years old. The cast of \"Grease\" had reunited for a special tribute 20 years after the movie's original release, and I'd spotted Newton-John, who died this week at 73, on TV doing the publicity rounds. To my horror, she was no longer an A-line skirt-wearing teen (I also had no idea that she was 28 when the movie was filmed), and there was no Alice band in her hair.\n\nHolly Thomas\n\nThankfully for all involved, she was so charming in her interview that I immediately forgave her for aging in the decades since her starring role as Sandy Olsson. Her smile was still dazzling, her chemistry with co-star John Travolta still enviably electric, and judging by her carefree demeanor at least, her real life seemed every bit as magical as that of her most famous character.\n\nAs I discovered when my fandom evolved beyond my initial obsession with \"Grease,\" this was not the case. The highs in Newton-John's life were more marvelous than most, but they were matched by dire lows. After her initial breast cancer diagnosis in 1992, she lived alongside the disease for the rest of her life, becoming as beloved for her related advocacy as she was for her most memorable role. She became a national treasure in Australia, where her work was pivotal in supporting research and treatment at the cancer center in Melbourne that bears her name.\n\nNewton-John made such an impact as an artist and advocate that much of the rest of her extraordinary and sometimes strange story is comparatively sidelined. Even a selective overview reveals a woman gifted with a chameleon-like ability to reinvent herself -- and underscores the futility of any attempt to pigeonhole a person's experience based on their most visible triumphs or misfortunes.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Australian pop star Olivia Newton-John's life in pictures Photos: Photos: Australian pop star Olivia Newton-John's life in pictures Olivia Newton-John waves goodbye in the 1978 movie \"Grease.\" Hide Caption 1 of 29 Photos: Photos: Australian pop star Olivia Newton-John's life in pictures A young Newton-John is seen in front here with her father, Brin; her brother, Hugh; her mother, Irene; and her sister, Rona.

The year her fame went stratospheric -- a moment anyone would be expected to capitalize on to the absolute max -- she also canceled a concert tour of Japan in protest of the killing of dolphins by the country's fisherman. Her tenderness for the creatures even found its way into her music -- her 1981 song \"The Promise (the Dolphin Song)\" was inspired by dolphins she met in Hawaii. \"It was strange,\" she told People in 1982 . \"The morning after I was in the pools, I woke up and the words and melody were in my head.

The summit has been billed as the “largest political gathering ever held in the UK”, GlasgowLive reported. And each member of the UN has been invited, meaning nearly 120 heads of state are expected to attend along with around 20,000 accredited delegates, the BBC added.\n\nAttendees have already had to deal with a number of “obstacles” including Covid-19 travel restrictions, and testing requirements, the FT said. However, securing a bed in the host city is “proving to be the most difficult hurdle of all”.\n\nAccommodation crisis\n\nHigh-profile delegates such as US President Joe Biden won’t have trouble finding a place to stay. But for other visitors to Glasgow, the city is facing an “accommodation crisis” with “rocketing” rental costs and hotels being booked out, the Daily Record reported.\n\nLandlords in Glasgow are looking to take advantage of the influx of visitors with some asking for as much as £36,000 to rent a flat for the Cop26 fortnight, the FT said. “A single room at Smiths Hotel in Finnieston, a 15-minute walk from the venue, is being offered at £14,000 for the two weeks of the event, before dropping to just £903 for the subsequent two weeks.”\n\nThe “squeeze” on available accommodation has sent prices soaring in Glasgow, BBC Scotland reported. On Monday one room in the city was advertised for £42 per night, but during the summit it would cost £1,400 per night.\n\nFiona Hooker, of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland campaign, said the cost and availability of accommodation was “a huge concern” for activists attending the summit. “It’s incredible that they can charge so much,” she told the BBC. “What people are looking for is a place to stay with a local person and the chance to feel part of the event.”\n\nCop26 fever spreads to Edinburgh\n\nGlasgow’s “gold rush” has now spread to Edinburgh, 40 miles east of the Cop26 host city, The Telegraph reported.

Three days later, 8,900 applications had been submitted, while 4,300 applicants had made appointments to submit their biometric details.\n\nOf these, 640 applications had been confirmed, and 300 visas issued. More than two million people have fled the war in Ukraine, with the majority seeking safety in neighbouring Poland, which has taken in 1.2 million refugees, according to the United Nations.\n\nTechnical difficulties and delays\n\nThe Guardian reported that Ukrainians attempting to flee to safety in the UK have described their “intense frustration and anger at the bureaucratic hurdles and technical difficulties” in trying to get a visa under the new scheme.\n\nApplicants told the paper they have been left in unfamiliar countries “wrestling with the complex application process” and hindered further by “difficulties uploading crucial documents or the application website was crashing”.

An independent review led by senior paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass was also highly critical of the Tavistock’s Gender Identity Development Service, which is to be wound down by next spring.\n\nThe closure means the UK will no longer have a dedicated gender identity clinic for under-18s, but new regional centres will be set up to “ensure the holistic needs” of “vulnerable” young patients are fully met, according to the NHS England.\n\nWhy is the clinic closing?\n\nThe clinic is being shut down after review chief Cass, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, concluded in a recently published report that the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) was not a “safe or viable long-term option”.\n\nNHS England commissioned the review in September 2020 “in response to a complex and diverse range of issues” including a “significant and sharp rise in referrals”. In the decade from 2011, referrals to the Tavistock rose from 250 to 5,000.\n\nOther issues included “scarce and inconclusive evidence to support clinical decision”; concerns about a “significant number” of children “presenting with neurodiversity and other mental health needs and risky behaviours”; long waiting times for assessments; and “significant external scrutiny” of the service, said NHS England.\n\nCass found that the current model of care was leaving young people “at considerable risk” of poor mental health and distress. According to her review, there were “critically important unanswered questions” over the clinic’s use of puberty blockers, which have been prescribed to children as young as ten, and “uncertainties about the long-term outcome of medical intervention”.\n\n“The “damning extent of the Tavistock’s failings” had already been “made clear in the Interim Cass report in February”, said Nikki Da Costa in The Telegraph.\n\nThese failings included “lack of open discussion among clinicians; pressure to adopt an unquestioning approach; failure to consider whether medical transition really is the best option; overlooking children’s complex needs; limited mental health assessments; failure to identify children who may be vulnerable and at risk; and failure to follow up after treatment”, Da Costa continued. “This would matter if it affected only a handful of children let alone thousands.

However, added Rose, whether Netflix, for whom the couple are making a docu-series, “got the memo remains to be seen”.\n\nThe couple are expected at the service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral on Friday and the pop concert at Buckingham Palace on Saturday evening.\n\nThe Palace had already announced that Harry and Meghan would not be joining the Queen on the main balcony after the Trooping the Colour parade on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Her Majesty is expected to meet Harry and Meghan’s daughter Lilibet for the first time on Saturday.

However, an unnamed source told The Times that the couple will attend “at least” one other public engagement during their visit.\n\nNetflix will “not be given any privileged access to royal events”, wrote Rose, “but there is nothing to stop their cameras lining up with other broadcasters, or Harry and Meghan being wired for sound”.\n\nITV added that the couple will arrive with their two children but a scaled-down team.

But the Resolution Foundation think tank found that one in eight low-income households in England do not sit within eligible council tax bands.\n\nRenters with “landlords responsible for council tax payments are also unlikely to receive the cost of living payment”, the BBC reported.\n\nWho qualifies for the council tax rebate?\n\nThe rebate is being paid to households whose home was in council tax bands A to D in England on 1 April. Around 20m homes qualify, including 95% of rented properties. The property must be the residents’ sole or main home to qualify, so second homes and empty properties are not eligible.\n\nAnyone in England and Wales can use their postcode to check which council tax band they are in on the gov.uk website. People in Scotland can check on the Scottish Assessors Association website.\n\nThe council tax band is based on the price that the property would have sold for on 1 April 1991 in England and Scotland, and on 1 April 2003 in Wales.\n\nLindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC the £3bn rebate plan was welcome but “imperfect”.\n\n“Around 640,000 of the poorest families in England aren’t eligible for automatic support, including one in five low-income families in London”, she warned, adding that “there is no way to stop landlords collecting the rebate instead of their bill-paying tenants”.\n\nHow to claim the refund\n\nIf you qualify for the rebate and you pay your council tax by direct debit, your local council will make the payment directly to your bank account. You do not need to contact your local authority or do anything else.\n\nIn recent weeks, councils have “urged people to ensure that they switched to direct debit so that they could be paid as promptly as possible”, the i news reported.\n\nLocal authorities will contact anyone who does not pay by direct debit to arrange the rebate payment. The Local Government Association has warned that this will take longer, as councils will also need to undertake pre-payment checks.\n\nThe Independent Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted an 80% take-up rate among those that do not pay via direct debit, with around 7% of the funds allocated by the Treasury expected to be unpaid to eligible households.\n\nThe government has ordered local authorities to ensure that eligible people receive their rebate by 30 September 2022 at the latest.\n\nCan council tax bands be challenged?\n\nCouncil tax bands can be challenged on the government website. The site warns that “you’ll be asked for evidence that your Council Tax band is wrong when you challenge for a property in England or Wales”.\n\nThe evidence includes “the addresses of up to five similar properties in a lower Council Tax band than yours”. And “you can also use the price that your property or similar properties sold for as evidence”, if the sales were between 1 April 1989 and 31 March 1993 for properties in England, or between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2005 for those in Wales.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/956617/inside-adelaide-cottage-prince-william-kate-middleton-home-royal", "title": "Inside Adelaide Cottage: the guesthouse set to become Prince ...", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to move into Adelaide Cottage, a “modest” property ten minutes’ walk from the Queen’s new official residence, Windsor Castle, according to reports.\n\nIn March this year, the Queen made the historic castle, founded by William the Conqueror in the 11th century, her permanent home and official residence. In the past, she tended to use Windsor Castle only as a weekend home and her residence during Easter and Royal Ascot week, with Buckingham Palace being her official home.\n\nThe monarch appears to have started a trend. Prince William and Kate Middleton are now set to relocate to Windsor, along with their three children: George, eight, Charlotte, seven, and Louis, four. The four-bedroom home needs “no extra taxpayer-funded security or costly refurb”, according to The Sun, and the move means that their three children will be able to start school in the area in the autumn.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail royal correspondent Rebecca English, the Cambridges have been planning a move to Berkshire since 2021 and “have enrolled Prince George in a new school there, where he is expected to be joined this September by his siblings”.\n\nAlong with being near the Queen, Adelaide Cottage is also closer to Kate’s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, who have lived for a decade in Bucklebury Manor, a seven-bedroom Grade II-listed Georgian property which is also in Berkshire.\n\nBuilt in 1831 as a retreat for William IV’s wife, Queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the cottage is the Cambridges’ “best and only option”, a royal insider revealed to The Sun’s royal correspondent Matt Wilkinson. The property is thought to have been refurbished as recently as 2015, with William and Kate keen to move in as early as this summer.\n\n‘Grace and favour’ residence\n\nOver the years, Adelaide Cottage has been used as a “grace and favour” residence for royal friends including Peter Townsend, the Battle of Britain pilot and equerry to King George VI who became the divorced lover of the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, between 1944 and 1952.\n\nPrincess Margaret reportedly spent “many Sunday visits” at the residence while Townsend lived there with his first wife, Rosemary. The princess \"played with the children on the lawn and Peter Townsend, off duty, sat back in a deckchair”, according to a 1950 newspaper report, republished The Sun.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/956970/how-much-did-the-platinum-jubilee-festivities-cost", "title": "How much did the Platinum Jubilee festivities cost? | The Week UK", "text": "Even before the bunting was unfurled and the street party tables were laid, some had questioned whether the Platinum Jubilee celebrations were worth the expense.\n\nThere had been some confusion on social media as to exactly how much the festivities would cost UK taxpayers, with Full Fact clarifying that miscalculations had severely overestimated the amount. But how much did it cost?\n\nGovernment funding\n\nRishi Sunak set aside £28m to fund the festivities in last year’s budget. “Such a sum may be a lot for individuals, but is peanuts for governments,” said The Times. The amount would “run the NHS for about two hours”, and worked out to be around £1 per household.\n\nThe £28m was “divided accordingly”, said The Mirror, with some allocated to “help revamp venues” such as village halls. The Department for Education spent £12m on the publication of a commemorative book for primary school children in the UK. Highlighting milestones and achievements of the Queen’s 70-year reign, the book’s cost amounted to around £3 per pupil.\n\nAdditional expenses\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said that the costs of policing during the event would only be known afterwards, but there were also increased night patrols across the country, “creating a highly visible presence” during the celebrations, said Yahoo Finance. Individual councils also spent money on their own celebrations, including the beacon lighting that took place on Thursday.\n\nThe National Lottery also made £22m available for communities across England, with 70 community projects receiving grants of up to £50,000. Arts Council England’s Let’s Create Jubilee Fund also issued grants of up to £10,000 to make sure creative and cultural activities took “centre stage” during the celebrations, said The Independent. Another £175,000 was also distributed to local libraries.\n\nBalance sheet\n\nThe “crown jewel” of the weekend’s celebrations was the Jubilee Pageant, said The Times, a display expected to cost around £15m. The event, which The Times said featured a “surreal image of a hologram Queen”, was organised by the Platinum Jubilee Pageant Ltd, which the paper said had been “independently fundraising to deliver the pageant at no cost to the taxpayer”. Sponsors including Burberry, Jaguar and Meta provided some of the funding.\n\nWhile the total bill for the celebrations would “be barely noticed on the public balance sheet”, The Times said that “the entire country not working for an extra day” would. An impact assessment published by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in February indicated that the additional jubilee bank holiday could cost the economy around £2.39bn.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/955430/why-prince-andrew-is-the-queens-favourite-son", "title": "Why Prince Andrew is the Queen's favourite son | The Week UK", "text": "Once seen as Britain’s “playboy prince” and a Falklands war hero, revelations over Prince Andrew’s friendship with the billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has meant a spectacular fall from grace for the man often described as the Queen’s “favourite son”.\n\nNow that a civil court case brought against him by accuser Virginia Giuffre is to go ahead, the Queen has stripped the Duke of York of his titles, including the use of HRH, and will redistribute his patronages across the Royal Family.\n\nIn a short statement released by Buckingham Palace, the Queen effectively moved him from “61 years as a public figure to a ‘private citizen’”, reported the BBC.\n\nA close relationship\n\nThe closeness between Prince Andrew and the Queen is said to go back to his early childhood.\n\nElizabeth, who by the time of Andrew’s birth in 1960 had been on the throne for seven years, was able to spend much more time with her younger children, Andrew and Edward.\n\n“When Prince Charles and Princess Anne were born, the Queen wasn’t able to spend the time with them that she would have wished to,” Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal commentator, told CNN.\n\nBy the time Andrew was born, the Queen “was able to give him more attention and Andrew was someone with whom she's had a particular affinity”, Fitzwilliams added.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, one royal insider has described Prince Andrew as “the spare she had for herself once she had produced the heir”.\n\nWhile the Queen is reported to have found Prince Charles “emotionally complicated” she found Andrew to be “straightforward” and “the more glass-half-full of the pair” who could “make her laugh and raise the family’s spirits”.\n\nEdward and Andrew were also kept much closer to home and were sent to Heatherdown Preparatory School, near Ascot, “so they could be educated nearer to Windsor Castle”.\n\n“The Queen made time for those children,” one royal source told the newspaper. “She used to turn up at the school with one bodyguard and drive herself sometimes. She would attend sports days and various matches.”\n\nThe birth of Prince Andrew is also said to have coincided with a revitalisation of the Queen’s marriage with Prince Philip, according to HistoryExtra. The site claimed that she associated Andrew with the “re-booting of her marriage and a happy time in her life”.\n\nFalklands war\n\nUnlike Prince Charles, who initially read archaeology and anthropology, and later history, at Cambridge University, Andrew followed in his father’s footsteps by joining the Navy in 1979. He trained as a helicopter pilot, no doubt a point of “great pride” for both his parents, said The Telegraph.", "authors": ["The Week"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/953368/kensington-palace-princess-diana-statue-verdict", "title": "The verdict on the Kensington Palace Princess Diana statue | The ...", "text": "In 2017, Princes William and Harry announced that a statue of their late mother would be erected in the grounds of Kensington Palace, her former home.\n\nBut the memorial to Diana, Princess of Wales unveiled yesterday in a rare joint public apperance by her sons has fallen flat with critics, with Tristram Fane Saunders’ suggestion in The Telegraph that “opinion is divided” over the statue appearing generous.\n\nThe Guardian’s Jonathan Jones laments the figures’ “aesthetic awfulness”, and says that Ian Rank-Broadley’s sculpture is “a spiritless and characterless hunk of nonsense” that is ultimately “nauseating”.\n\nAnd Rachel Campbell-Johnston’s two-star review in The Times is in agreement, adding that aesthetically it is “so horrible” it can only have been “calculated to appeal to the lowest common denominator”.\n\nDiana stands “arms outspread in the pose of a traditional religious Madonna”, Campbell-Johnston continues, with her hands on the shoulders of two young children with a third hidden just behind.\n\nThe illusion to the Virgin Mary “shamelessly plays up to the most mawkish aspects of Diana worship”, writes Jones, with the People’s Princess portrayed as a “modern Mary”.\n\nMark Hudson’s interpretation at The Independent that the male child \"looks out with a resolute, hopeful expression” is at least a little more positive.\n\nThe outfit is “somewhat frumpy”, says Campbell-Johnston. Renowned for her style, it seems odd to memorialise Diana in such a way, the belt an already outdated faux-pas, the skirt un-noteworthy. As The Times’s art critic says: “Could it be that Laura Ashley has made it on to a public monument.”\n\nMembers of the general public will likely still flock to see the statue, the critics note. A shrine “it will be, but not for art lovers”, says Jones.\n\nPerhaps it was the memorial’s chosen medium that limited the artistic potential of this undertaking. A bronze “belongs to the norms and standards of another time”, writes Hudson, and is a medium better suited to memorials of “colonial generals, Victorian politicians and fascist dictators” than to a forward-looking woman renowned for her grace on the public stage.\n\nOr perhaps it was the choice of artist that let this project down. Had Rank-Broadley fulfilled Jones’s hope that the image “might be wildly provocative” – the secret nature of the sculpture’s design stirring the “fascinating prospect of a naked Diana for everyone to get furious about” – the final result may have been a greater success.\n\nIn Campbell-Johnston’s opinion, the sculptor chosen to carry out this prestigious work should “certainly have been female”, not one of Britain’s “most safely established middle-aged white male artists”.\n\nThe statue is accompanied by a poem, which could perhaps have redeemed the sculpture's artistic value. But, Fane Saunders says in The Telegraph, the statue is in fact the “better” of the two.\n\nHe traces the poetic origins of the selected lines engraved on a slab in front of the statue back to Wallace Gallaher’s 1923 The Measure of a Man, with the word “man” substituted for “woman”. “If you have to re-write it to make it appropriate, you’ve chosen the wrong poem,” he says.\n\nThe statue will “play second fiddle to the flower garden in which it is set”, says Campbell-Johnston, and even Jones concedes that the flower beds are “nice”.\n\nThat the statue is “by far the best result we could have hoped for under the circumstances”, as Hudson says, feels generous. “Princess Diana deserved something much better”, Campbell-Johnston adds.", "authors": ["Julia O"], "publish_date": "2021/07/02"}]}

Hilary Delamere, his literary agent, said Briggs “liked to act the professional curmudgeon, but we will remember him for his stories of love and of loss”.\n\nHe created a “host of much-loved characters”, said The Guardian. The Snowman sold more than 5.5m copies around the world, and Briggs also created popular children’s books Father Christmas and Fungus The Bogeyman.\n\nHere are some lesser-known facts about the fondly remembered artist.\n\nHe served in the Royal Signals\n\nWriting for The Times in 2004, Rod Liddle denounced Briggs’s nuclear war story When the Wind Blows as representing “the spirit and mental acuity of the pacifist” and Briggs was also denounced in the House of Lords as the dupe of a KGB-inspired plot.\n\nHowever, he had served as a National Service conscript in the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick between 1953 and 1955, where his artistic flair was put to work as a draughtsman, noted the Daily Mail. “Much to his disgust,” he was asked to draw electrical circuits, noted the BBC.\n\nHe wasn’t interested in children\n\nDespite being famous for his books for children, Briggs said he was not a fan of kids. “I’ve never been particularly interested in children at all, as such,” he told The Guardian in 2016. He said he didn’t “particularly dislike them” but was not “a child lover”.\n\nWhen he was considered for the role of children’s laureate he said he “wouldn’t touch it with a bargepole,” adding: “I don’t actually know anything much about children. I try to avoid them whenever possible.”\n\nHe was a ‘creative sociopath’\n\nBriggs was often described as a “curmudgeon” but those closest to him have suggested this was partly an act. Briggs told The Guardian he preferred to regard himself as a “creative sociopath”. A definition of this, pinned up on his wall, stated that: “artistic people… can appear self-absorbed, impulsive, impatient and intolerant”. After reading the definition aloud to the interviewer, he added: “Brilliant. That’s me to a tee.”\n\nHis wife had schizophrenia\n\nHis wife, Jean Taprell Clark, had schizophrenia and although he was not the “marrying type” he said he decided to marry her “mainly because I thought it would help her mental state – give her a feeling of stability”. Briggs wrote that he found her schizophrenia “inspiring” because it meant “her feelings about nature and experiences of life were very intense”, noted The Times. She died in 1973, of “schizophrenia combined with leukaemia”, which he described as “a jolly one-man-band”. His second partner, Liz Benjamin, also died, in 2015.\n\nAdult fans pretended to be children\n\nAdult collectors wrote to him pretending to be children in the hope of getting their hands on memorabilia, Briggs told The Telegraph in 2004. However, he explained, he spotted the ruse a mile off. “They’re just middle-aged anoraks out for something to flog – ghastly, stupid individuals,” he said. “You know what a child would write, and how they’d write it. These ones… no, I won’t say what’s wrong with them because somebody might read this and adjust their forged letter appropriately.”", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}]}
