They claimed that a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen – dubbed LK-99 – exhibits two key signs of superconductivity: zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect, in which the material expels magnetic fields.\n\nA video attached to one of the papers appeared to prove the sample’s magnetic properties by showing the stone-like material levitating, although many materials can exhibit similar behaviour.\n\nWhile superconductors already exist, they currently only operate under extremely low temperatures or high pressures, making them “too difficult and expensive to use in most everyday applications”, said The Verge.\n\nWhy the buzz?\n\n“If true, it represents colossal progress,” said the FT’s Ahuja. Scientists have spent decades searching for a substance that is superconducting under normal, day-to-day conditions, and finding one “would have a revolutionary impact on a wide range of industries”, said New York magazine.\n\nIt would “pave the way for perfectly efficient high-capacity power grids, desktop quantum computing, fusion reactors and even levitating trains”, said the FT.\n\nToday might have seen the biggest physics discovery of my lifetime.

The company did not specify how much carbon had been removed.\n\nLast year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that technologies including direct air capture and carbon capture and storage (CCS) were “likely to be necessary” to ensure that any “temperature overshoot” beyond the maximum 1.5C above pre-industrial levels required to limit climate change was “temporary”, The Guardian’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey reported at the time.\n\nBut The Wall Street Journal said “it will be decades” before direct air capture “makes a dent in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and critics say it could provide an excuse for business as usual policies on fossil fuels”.\n\nCapturing carbon\n\nCarbon capture is “one of the most important technologies to address climate change”, the paper said. There are two main ways that the different processes operate.\n\nCCS is the process in which atmospheric carbon is caught from “concentrated industrial emissions at their source, preventing them from entering the atmosphere at all”, explained The Independent’s environment correspondent Harry Cockburn. These technologies could help to “neutralise emissions from new power plants”, said The Guardian’s Harvey.\n\nBy contrast, carbon dioxide removal – or direct air capture – technologies “suck greenhouse gas emissions directly out of the air, removing them at very low concentrations”, said Cockburn.\n\nClimeworks “uses giant vacuum-like devices” to pull air through a filter, trapping “massive amounts of CO2”, said the newspaper’s deputy technology editor Anthony Cuthbertson, before it is heated, mixed with water and pumped below ground “into stone storage designed to be kept out of the atmosphere for millennia”.\n\nAccording to The Independent, “there is a consensus that investing and utilising these technologies needs to be rapidly scaled up to have the impact required to keep the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement in sight”.\n\nFix for the future?\n\nClimeworks’ development “has been a long time coming”, said CNBC’s climate innovation and technology reporter, Cat Clifford.

As a result, cases and hospitalizations may tick up after the holiday, as they have for the past two years.\n\nCovid-19 is not unique in this regard. Thanksgiving gatherings have the potential to amp up the spread of other viruses too, notably respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and influenza, which are both already at high levels for this time of year.\n\n“We have seen, in some regions, RSV numbers starting to trend downward. Flu numbers are still on the rise. And we are concerned that after holiday gathering, lots of people coming together, that we may see increases in Covid-19 cases as well,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday on CNN.\n\nBut things have been relatively quiet on the Covid-19 front. Experts say it may not stay that way for long.\n\n“Covid positivity is going up,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at the genetic testing company Helix, which has been monitoring coronavirus variants. “It’s increasing fastest among 18- to 24-year-olds” in the Helix sampling.\n\nIt’s the first time test positivity in the Helix data has risen since July.\n\nWhen test positivity increases, it means a greater proportion of Covid-19 tests are returning positive results, and it can be an indication that transmission is on the rise.\n\n“We should expect more cases,” Luo said. “Whether they’re measured in how we measure cases right now, I don’t know, but I think in general, you should see more people who are sick. I definitely am.”\n\nIncreasing cases may not be picked up as quickly by official counts because people are mostly testing for Covid-19 at home and not reporting their results – if they test at all.\n\nWill new subvariants drive a wave of cases?\n\nThe BQ subvariants of Omicron have risen to dominate transmission in the US. BQ.1 and its offshoot BQ.1.1 are descendants of BA.5; they have five and six key mutations, respectively, in their spike proteins that help them evade immunity created by vaccines and infections. Because of these changes, they’re growing more quickly than BA.5 did.\n\nFor the week ending Nov. 19, the CDC estimates that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were causing about half of all new Covid-19 cases in the US. But so far, they’ve risen to predominance without much impact.\n\nCovid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have remained flat for the past four weeks. But it’s not gone: On average, more than 300 Americans die and 3,400 people are hospitalized each day with Covid-19, according to CDC data.\n\nNobody knows exactly what will happen with the BQ variants. Many experts say they feel hopeful that we won’t see the big waves of winters past – certainly nothing like the original Omicron variant, with its jaw-dropping peak of nearly a million new daily infections.\n\nThere’s reason for optimism on a number of fronts.\n\nFirst, there’s the experience of other countries like the UK, where BQ.1 has outcompeted its rivals to dominate transmission even as cases, hospitalizations and deaths have fallen. Something similar happened in France and Germany, notes Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n“Cases went up in France and Germany just before the subvariants came in. Then the subvariants came in, and cases actually dropped,” he said.\n\nBill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, thinks our behavior and our social contacts might be bigger determinants of whether cases will rise this go-round than whatever variant is in the lead.\n\nHe thinks it’s likely that we’ll see a rise in cases that may peak around the second week in January – as it has in years past – but that it won’t have a big effect on hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that’s probably because BQ.1’s advantages are incremental, not drastic.\n\n“It’s probably got a bit more of a fitness advantage, so what we’re seeing is gradual replacement without a massive change in the total number of Covid-19 cases,” he said.\n\nAmerica lags in vaccination\n\nAll that’s not to say that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 won’t have any impact. They’ve shown marked resistance to the antibodies that are available to protect and treat people who are vulnerable to severe Covid-19 infections. From that standpoint, there’s good reason for people to be cautious if they have weakened immune systems or will be around someone who does.\n\nBut these subvariants will land at a time when population immunity is higher than ever, thanks to vaccines and infections. It’s a very different setting than the virus encountered when Omicron emerged a year ago, and that should also help dampen any coming wave, Pekosz says.\n\n“With lots of people now being boosted and vaccinated and with people having some immunity from an Omicron infection, it’s also a very, very different sort of population landscape for a variant to emerge in,” he said. “All the signs are, I think, the best part of the scenario in terms of not seeing these massive increases in cases.”\n\nIf there’s reason to worry about BQ in the US, it could be this: Americans aren’t as well-vaccinated or boosted as other countries. CDC data shows that two-thirds of the population has completed the primary series of the Covid-19 vaccines, and only 11% of those who are eligible have gotten an updated bivalent booster. In the UK, 89% of the population over age 12 has completed their primary series, and 70% have been boosted.\n\nNew research indicates that a country’s vaccination rate matters more than any other single factor when it comes to the effects of variants on a population.\n\nScientists at Los Alamos National Labs recently completed a study delving into what drove the effects of 13 dominant variants of coronavirus as they transitioned from one to another in 213 countries. The study includes data up to the end of September and was published as a preprint ahead of peer review.\n\nAmong 14 variables that influenced the speed and height of new Covid-19 waves, a population’s vaccination rate was by far the most important.\n\nThe number of previous cases in a country, the percentage of people who wore masks, average income and the percentage of the population older than 65 ran a distant second, third, fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nHow many other variants are in the mix when a new one rises is also an important factor, says senior study author Bette Korber, a laboratory fellow in the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group at Los Alamos.\n\nShe points to the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, and how it behaved in the UK versus the US.\n\n“When it came through England, it was just extremely fast, but it was much slower in the Americas,” Korber said.\n\nBy the time Alpha reached the United States, we were evolving our own variants out of California and New York “that were very distinctive and had a competitive edge compared to what it had to come up against in England,” Korber said, which probably slowed its roll here.\n\nThe CDC is tracking a soup of more than a dozen Omicron subvariants that are causing cases in the US, and that variety may end up helping dampen any wave over the winter.\n\nBut Korber isn’t making any predictions. She says it’s just too difficult to know what’s going to happen, pointing to Asia as the source of her uncertainty.\n\nAsian countries have been contending with waves driven by the recombinant XBB, a subvariant that really hasn’t had much of a presence in the US. The BQ variants arrived later, but she says they look impressive against XBB, which is also highly immune-evasive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“BQ is really making a stand there,” Korber said. “So I think it’s not really possible to be certain yet” what could happen in the US.\n\n“To me, it’s a good time, when it’s possible, to wear masks,” she said. Masks protect the wearer as well as others around them. “And get the booster if you’re eligible and it’s the right moment for you,” especially as we gather around the table to feast with our friends and family.\n\n“It’s a time to exercise a little additional caution to prevent that wave that we don’t want to see happening, or at least make it a smaller bump,” Korber said", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/variants-covid-winter-surge/index.html", "title": "Quick and stealthy new Covid-19 variants are poised to drive a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA flurry of new Covid-19 variants appears to be gaining traction globally, raising fears of a winter surge.\n\nIn the United States, these are BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.4.6, BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2. In other countries, the recombinant variant XBB has been rising quickly and appears to be fueling a new wave of cases in Singapore. Cases are also rising in Europe and the UK, where these variants have taken hold.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, says he thinks of them collectively as the Scrabble variants because they use letters that get high scores in the board game like Q, X and B.\n\nAs the US moves into the fall, Covid-19 cases are dropping. Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters. But virus experts fear that the downward trend may soon reverse itself, thanks to this gaggle of new variants.\n\nLumped together, the variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new Covid-19 infections nationwide last week, according to the latest estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe updated bivalent booster vaccines and antiviral drugs like Paxlovid are expected to continue to be protective against severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections caused by the new variants.\n\nBut the new variants are particularly devastating for millions of Americans who have weakened immune systems. New research suggests that changes in these variants make them impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to help treat and prevent severe cases of Covid-19, and the US government has run out of money to incentivize the creation of new ones.\n\nA crowded field of rising variants\n\nIt’s not clear whether this gang of new variants will continue to run around together, each sharing a piece of the Covid-19 infection pie, or whether one will rise to outcompete the others, as has happened in previous surges.\n\nThough they each descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, these new offshoots have evolved to share many of the same mutations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\n\nSome experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase of the evolution of the virus, one that will see circulation of several variants at the same time.\n\n“What is likely to happen is that we have several co-circulating, semi-dominate lineages going into the winter season,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n“That’s because with convergent evolution, perhaps several different lineages can independently obtain similar transmissibility levels versus a single new variant taking over.\n\n“This is what predominantly happens for most pathogens, such as the flu and RSV,” Grubaugh wrote in an email. “Now that the virus has adapted pretty well to human transmission, most of what is circulating has high fitness.”\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 response technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that the large mix of new variants was becoming more difficult for WHO to assess because countries were dialing back on their surveillance.\n\n“So we need to be prepared for this. Countries need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, to deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with increases and hospitalizations. We don’t see a change in severity yet. And our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,” she said.\n\nInaction gives the virus an edge\n\nFor now, the Omicron subvariant BA.5 still holds the top spot in the US. According to CDC estimates, it caused about 68% of new infections in the US last week, but it is quickly being outcompeted by several new sublineages – notably BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nThe BQs each caused just 6% of new infections in the US last week, but in recent weeks, the share of new Covid-19 infections caused by these viruses has doubled every six to seven days – a rapid rate of growth against BA.5, which is already a highly fit virus, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd these are just two of the new crop of Omicron descendants making a move.\n\n“The projections vary a little, but generally, most people feel somewhere in the middle of November that they’ll wind up being a substantial proportion and have bumped BA.5 off as the dominant variant,” Fauci told CNN.\n\nThese variants are different from BA.4 and BA.5, but they’re descended from those viruses, the result of genetic drift. So they share many parts of their genomes with that virus.\n\nTheir changes aren’t on the scale of what happened when the original Omicron arrived on the scene in November 2021. That strain of the virus, which is now long gone, came out of genetic left field, leaving researchers and public health officials scrambling to catch up.\n\nFauci says that this time, we are as ready as we could be for the latest batch of variants.\n\n“It isn’t that different from BA.5 that it would completely escape the protection that you would get from vaccine” – if people would just get the shot, Fauci said.\n\nThe bivalent booster vaccine, authorized in September, protects against the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n“We have a BA.5 bivalent updated vaccine as a booster that we’re pushing people to do. It’s matched against the still-dominant variant, which is BA.5, and almost certainly will have a reasonably good degree of cross-protection against the BQ.1.1 and the others, and yet the uptake of these vaccines, as we are already in the middle of October, is disappointing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, 14.8 million people have gotten an updated bivalent booster six weeks into the campaign promoting it. That’s less than 10% of the population that’s eligible to get one.\n\nThe poor uptake of the new boosters, combined with the immune evasiveness of the new variants and the waning of population immunity, is almost surely a recipe for rising cases and hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.\n\n“It’s probably going to be significantly bigger than the BA.5 wave, at least that’s what I expect,” said Mark Zeller, a project scientist who monitors variants at the Scripps Research Institute. But Zeller says he doesn’t expect this winter’s surge to reach heights of January’s Omicron wave.\n\nHotez says people shouldn’t panic about this news but should pay attention.\n\n“We’re underperforming as a nation with people getting their bivalent boosters,” Hotez said.\n\nThe genetic changes these variants share appear to help them escape the immunity created by vaccines and past infections – a recipe for reinfections and breakthrough infections, particularly for people who haven’t had an updated booster.\n\nCritical therapies could soon stop working\n\nCrucially, some of the variants also appear to be impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to ward off severe Covid-19 infections: an antibody treatment called bebtelovimab, which is made by Eli Lilly, and the combination of two long-acting antibodies in Evusheld, a shot made by AstraZeneca that helps keep people who are immunocompromised from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIf these antibodies stop working against the virus, the United States will still have Covid-19 antiviral drugs like Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remedsivir to help those at risk of severe complications.\n\nBut antibody therapies are particularly important for people with immune function that has been blunted by drugs, disease or age. These are the same people whose bodies don’t respond robustly to vaccines.\n\nThe antibodies are also needed to help people who can’t take antiviral therapies because of possible reactions with other medications.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha says the federal government has been spurring the development of new monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic by promising to purchase new therapies after they’re made.\n\nThe government can’t do that anymore, he said, because Congress has declined to pass additional funding for the Covid-19 response.\n\nAs a result, development of new antibodies – and other new therapeutics – is lagging.\n\n“So even if we got money today, it would take us many months to bring a monoclonal into the marketplace, and we don’t have the money today anyway,” Jha told CNN.\n\nJha said that means the nation is facing fall and winter with a smaller arsenal against the virus, just when it needs to expand its options.\n\n“There is not a monoclonal sitting ready to go tomorrow that we could just buy off the shelf,” he said.\n\nAntibodies are a losing proposition for companies because it takes millions of dollars of investment to make them and because the virus is evolving so fast, they might be effective for only a few months.\n\n“That is a terrible business model,” Jha said.\n\nThe administration has been thinking about ways to commercialize some parts of the Covid-19 response – to get out of the business of buying vaccines and therapies – ultimately passing the costs on to consumers and insurers. But Jha says the process has to be guided by “the needs on the ground and the realities of the virus.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe says current realities require that the government continue to incentivize the production of new therapies, and he expects that the Biden administration will again try to ask Congress to pass more funding to do that.\n\n“And the truth is that if we want monoclonals to protect high-risk people – which we do – then at this point, given the speed of viral evolution, the US government has to be a major player in that role,” Jha said. “The market cannot take care of it by itself.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/health/uk-fall-wave-covid-us/index.html", "title": "Rising Covid-19 Cases in the UK may be a warning for the US | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere are signs that the United Kingdom could be heading into a fall Covid-19 wave, and experts say the United States may not be far behind.\n\nA recent increase in Covid-19 cases in England doesn’t seem to be driven by a new coronavirus variant, at least for now, although several are gaining strength in the US and across the pond.\n\n“Generally, what happens in the UK is reflected about a month later in the US. I think this is what I’ve sort of been seeing,” said Dr. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at Kings College London.\n\nSpector runs the Zoe Health Study, which uses an app to let people in the UK and US report their daily symptoms. If they start to feel bad, they take a home Covid-19 test and record those results. He says that about 500,000 people are currently logging their symptoms every day to help track trends in the pandemic.\n\nSpector says the study, which has been running since the days of the first lockdown in England in 2020, has accurately captured the start of each wave, and its numbers run about one to two weeks ahead of official government statistics.\n\nAfter seeing a downward trend for the past few weeks, the Zoe study saw a 30% increase in reported Covid-19 cases within the past week.\n\n“Our current data is definitely showing this is the beginning of the next wave,” Spector said.\n\nOn Friday, that increase was reflected in official UK government data too, although it was not as large as the increases reported by Zoe loggers.\n\nData from the National Health Service showed that after falling for nearly two months, the seven-day average of new cases in England and Wales rose 13% for the week ending September 17 over the week before. The seven-day average of hospitalizations was up 17% in the week ending September 19 compared with the week prior.\n\nThe data aligns with what models have predicted would happen in both the UK and the US.\n\n“They predicted that we’d get a June to July peak and then there’d be a month where nothing happened in August and then it would flatten in in August and September and then start again in October. So it’s exactly matching what the modelers have have been predicting,” Spector said.\n\nIn the US, some models have predicted that Covid-19 cases will begin to rise again in October and continue to increase into the winter. Experts are hopeful that because most of the population now has some underlying immunity to the coronavirus, this wave would be less deadly than we’ve seen in previous winters.\n\nIs this a blip or a wave?\n\nIt’s not clear what’s driving the increase in the UK or whether it will be sustained.\n\n“These trends may continue for more than a week or two, or they may not,” said Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England.\n\nBroken down by age, he says, there are clear increases among adolescents who are around middle school age and younger adults, those 25 through 34.\n\n“It wouldn’t be surprising if there were some increase in infection as people come back from summer holidays and as the schools reopen,” McConway said in a statement to the nonprofit Science Media Centre. “Even if it is, there’s certainly no clear indication yet that it will continue.”\n\nHe’s not the only one who needs to see more data before calling this the start of a new wave.\n\n“Question one is, how significant is that rise? Is it, for instance, the beginning of something, a new wave, or is this a temporary blip because of all of the getting together around the Queen’s funeral and other events that have been going on?” said Dr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston.\n\nA second important question will be whether the increase is being driven by a new variant.\n\n“That’s the worst possible situation. Because historically, when that situation occurs in the UK, it’s reflected within a matter of weeks in the United States,” Hotez said. “That was true of the Alpha wave; that was true of the Delta wave; that was true of Omicron and its subvariants.”\n\nThe role of new variants\n\nThat’s where the US may catch a break this time around.\n\nInstead of new variants, Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London, thinks cases are going up in the UK because of a combination of waning immunity and behavioral changes.\n\nMany people in the UK are several months past their last Covid-19 booster or infection, and government statistics show that just 8% of adults 50 and older have gotten an Omicron-specific vaccine since the government started its fall vaccination campaign in September. School and work have fully resumed after the summer holidays, and people are spending more time indoors as the temperature drops.\n\nImmunity is also waning in the United States, and Americans have also been slow to get boosted. Just 35% of those for whom a booster is recommended have had one, according to CDC data.\n\nThe updated boosters in the US are slightly different from the ones in the UK. The UK is using vaccines that have been updated to fight the original version of Omicron, which is not circulating anymore. US boosters have been updated to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which are currently causing infections both here and abroad. It’s not clear whether the strain differences will have an effect on cases or disease severity.\n\nThere are a mix of new variants – offshoots of BA.4 and BA.5 – that are waiting in the wings. They represent just a small proportion of total cases, but several are growing against BA.5, which is still dominating transmission.\n\n“It is very likely that these will accelerate current increases and cause a substantial wave in October” in the UK, Pagel said in an email to CNN.\n\nOther experts agree with that assessment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“There is talk about a bunch of lineages with concerning mutations, including BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, etc, but none of these are of high enough frequency in the UK right now to be driving the change in cases,” Nathan Grubaugh, who studies the epidemiology of microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health, said in an email to CNN.\n\nHe says the mix of variants in the UK seems to be much the same as it is in the US, at least for now.\n\n“We are seeing the increase in many respiratory viruses right now in the US, so it’s not a stretch to think that a new COVID wave (or ripple) will be coming soon,” he wrote.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/health/covid-variants-concern-new-year/index.html", "title": "Coronavirus: 2022 ends with looming risk of a new variant, public ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the world enters a new year, many public health and infectious disease experts predict that monitoring for new coronavirus variants will be an increasingly important part of Covid-19 mitigation efforts – and some are turning their attention to a surge in cases in China.\n\nSubvariants of the Omicron coronavirus variant continue to circulate globally, and “we’re seeing Omicron do what viruses do, which is it picks up mutations along the way that helps it evade a little bit of immunity that’s induced by previous infection or vaccination,” said Andrew Pekosz, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\n“We haven’t seen any major jumps in terms of Omicron evolution in some time,” he said. But “it’s getting to that stage where it’s something that we have to continue to monitor.”\n\nIn the United States, the Omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BA.5 and XBB are causing almost all Covid-19 infections, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor this week, the CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 now causes 40.5% of cases in the US, followed by BQ.1.1 at 26.9%; BQ.1 at 18.3%; BA.5 at 3.7%; and XBB at 3.6%.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code over time. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge,” CDC researchers write in their data tracker. “Some variants will emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.”\n\nOmicron’s offshoots appear to dominate globally as well, but as the coronavirus continues to spread – especially in China after Beijing’s rapid easing of restrictions – there is now concern about where Covid-19 trends could be heading in 2023 and the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n“It is a worry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And that, of course, has led to the CDC’s very recent announcement that they are going to oblige people who come to this country from China to be tested and test negative before they can come into the country.”\n\nUS health officials announced Wednesday that, starting January 5, travelers from China will be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result before flying to the country. Passengers traveling to the US from China will need to get tested no more than two days before flying and present proof of the negative test to their airline before boarding.\n\nOfficials also announced that the CDC is expanding the traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with about 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered, including about 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chinese government has not been sharing a lot of information about the genetic composition of the viruses that it’s seeing there, Schaffner said.\n\n“Because the Chinese government was not doing that, that was the main reason CDC put this new travel requirement in place. It’s certainly not to prevent simple transmission of Covid from China here. We’ve got plenty of Covid. That would be like telling people not to pour a bucket of water into a swimming pool,” he said. “This travel testing requirement is a way to buy us some time and help create somewhat of a buffer between ourselves and China, should a new variant suddenly appear in that country.”\n\nHe added that the US will need “as much time as possible” to update vaccines and antivirals to respond to a potential emerging variant of concern.\n\n‘It really is a bit of a black hole’\n\nThe US testing requirements for travelers will “buy some time,” but they won’t prevent new Covid-19 cases from coming to the United States or new variants from emerging, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, the executive associate dean for the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to see much benefit, honestly,” he said of the travel requirements. “The most important thing we need right now is, we need the Chinese to have more transparency and tell us exactly what’s going on, and that is pretty much a diplomatic decision. This is about diplomacy.”\n\nIn terms of the genetic data on coronaviruses in China that is accessible to the public, “It really is a bit of a black hole,” Pekosz said. Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation’s top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported last week.\n\n“To me, what’s really a concern is the ongoing infections and whether they’re producing more variants in China that might be of particular concern for us, and testing people before they get on a plane won’t answer that question,” Pekosz said.\n\n“What we really need is to do a much better job of sequencing the viruses from individuals who are traveling from China so that we can aid in terms of understanding what kinds of variants are circulating there,” he said, adding that throughout the pandemic, Chinese officials have not been very transparent about their data on variants.\n\nMore spread, more variants\n\nConstant spread of a virus is what can lead to the emergence of variants. The more a virus spreads, the more it mutates.\n\n“For a variant to emerge – and this is true not only for Covid, but for influenza and for a lot of other viruses – the most critical thing is, the more cases that you have, the more likely that the virus will start to accumulate mutations that might have the ability to evade immunity more effectively or to transmit more effectively,” Pekosz said.\n\n“So when you have a situation like what’s starting to turn out in China, where you’re going to have millions upon millions of infections, every one of those infections is just one additional opportunity for the virus to pick up a random mutation that might make it better at infecting people,” he said. “Combine that with the fact that the Chinese population has been using less-than-optimal vaccines and has apparently not been as good about putting boosters into their population as other countries have, that means that there’s probably a lower amount of immunity in the population.”\n\nHealth authorities in China have “noticeably increased” the number of coronavirus genome sequences and other related data they are submitting to the global database GISAID, an initiative that maintains databases for scientists around the world to share data on flu viruses and coronaviruses.\n\nBut many experts argue that it’s not enough.\n\nGISAID said in an email to CNN on Wednesday that China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and several regional centers in the country, “have noticeably increased the number of submissions of genome sequence and associated metadata from samples taken in recent days.”\n\nThe number of genome sequences from China grew to just shy of 1,000, as of Friday, according to GISAID.\n\nGISAID also confirmed that the sequences from China “all closely resemble known globally circulating variants seen in different parts of the world between July and December 2022,” compared with the 14.4 million genomes in its database.\n\n“These latest data provide a snapshot of the evolution of the Omicron variants and shows that these most recently shared sequences from China are closely related to variants that have been circulating for some time,” according to GISAID.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nCovid-19 is in a relatively “stable” state right now in the United States, but the nation still sees about 350 deaths related to the disease each day, said Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and senior technical director of the global health program ICAP.\n\nWhile Covid-19 levels remain far below those of prior surges, trends are on the rise in parts of the US, new hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month, and there is growing concern that case numbers could soar after the winter holidays.\n\nTo reduce the risk of increased Covid-19 spread, Justman said, it will be important for people in the new year to continue to stay up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nOnly 14.6% of the US population ages 5 and older has gotten their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\n“So where are we going? That does take me to China,” Justman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’m concerned that China right now is one giant incubator of SARS-CoV-2. There is the potential to have so many infections and with that, new variants,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to be looking at new variants of concern” in 2023, Justman said. “The question is: Will we go back to a point where we have a variant of concern that causes such severe illness that we don’t get the benefit of our protection from prior infections and from prior vaccinations? … I’m going to be optimistic and say I don’t think we’re going to go back to that point.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/world/covid-omicron-schools-uk-europe-us-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "From Europe to the US, Covid cases in children are surging ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs Covid-19 cases skyrocketed across Britain in late December, Stuart Guest spent his vacation poring over scientific reports about air cleaning and filtration systems.\n\nGuest, a head teacher at an elementary school in Birmingham, England, scoured Amazon for affordable air purifiers in the hopes of stopping the more transmissible Omicron variant from spreading among his 460 students, who are between 3 and 11 years old.\n\nThe British government recommends two models made by Dyson and Camfil, but at £424 ($575) and £1,170 ($1,590), respectively, they were too expensive. Guest ultimately bought £200 ($270) portable units for each classroom.\n\n“I got what I think is the best air purifier for the budget I have available. I hope I’ve got something that’s doing the job, but I’m not an expert. And there’s been no guidance put out by the Department for Education. I’ve had to do it all myself, and I shouldn’t have to do that when it’s a national crisis,” Guest said.\n\nMillions of British students have returned to school following the Christmas and New Year holidays, amid a record surge in infections and hospitalizations. For teachers and parents, the situation has brought a grim sense of déjà vu. Unlike last January, when the rampaging Alpha variant plunged the United Kingdom into another lockdown, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has decided to “ride out” the Omicron wave with limited restrictions and to keep schools open, citing the toll remote education has taken on students’ mental health and learning.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged the UK's National Health Service was on a \"war footing\" in a televised address, but said he would not bring in further restrictions. Jack Hill/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut leading teachers’ unions say the government hasn’t done enough to keep classrooms safe, demanding financial support for air-cleaning units, on-site Covid-19 testing and substitute teaching staff in a rare joint letter.\n\nAhead of the new term, the Department for Education announced twice-weekly testing requirements and temporary masking for students in middle and high schools, but not for elementary school students. The department said it would be providing 7,000 air-cleaning units for teaching spaces where quick fixes, like opening windows, are impossible – approximately one for every three schools in England. To plug staffing gaps, the UK’s education minister has also suggested combining classes, and called on retired teachers to show “Blitz spirit” to return to the classroom.\n\n“It’s woefully inadequate,” said Guest of the government’s measures. “They keep saying education is their number one priority. It’s clear it absolutely isn’t.” Last Wednesday, five of his staff, including three of his 15 classroom teachers, were out sick or isolating – the most absent from Guest’s school since the start of the pandemic – and he said he feared more would follow.\n\nAs Omicron takes its toll around the world, the ramshackle infrastructure that has kept schools running over the past year is in jeopardy. The variant, which has spurred a record rise in pediatric infections in the United Kingdom, parts of Europe and the United States, threatens to upend the shaky balance that allowed schools to mostly stay open last year – albeit with targeted classroom closures. It’s also cast a harsh spotlight on just how little has been done in some places to protect students, with teachers resorting to propping open windows in freezing weather and frequently checking carbon dioxide monitors while delivering their lessons.\n\nIn the US, more children are being admitted to hospitals than ever before. The Biden administration has said schools are “more than equipped” to stay open, as Omicron rips across the country. But some elected officials are erring on the side of caution by delaying the new term, while a teachers’ union forced public schools in Chicago, Illinois, to shutter for a week amid criticism from members that conditions in classrooms are dangerous.\n\nA Chicago elementary school sits empty last week. Chicago schools will reopen Wednesday after the teachers' union and the city struck a deal over Covid-19 safety measures. Jim Vondruska/Reuters\n\nThough outbreaks in schools can occur, studies in the UK, Australia, US and Italy have shown that spread among children in school settings is typically lower than – or at least similar to – levels of community transmission, when mitigation strategies like masks are in place. But experts are waiting to see whether the more contagious Omicron variant may change that calculus, and trigger an explosion in cases in classrooms.\n\nWhile children have been less likely than adults to develop severe illness from Covid-19, they can still get very sick or die, or they could develop complications like life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome and long Covid. Up to one in seven children and young people may have Covid-19 symptoms as many as 15 weeks after illness, a study by the UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London found. According to the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS), 117,000 children in the UK are now living with long Covid.\n\nOmicron appears to be causing milder illness than previous variants, but early research has also suggested that Omicron may trigger more upper-airway problems, which can be more dangerous for young children, potentially leading to croup and bronchiolitis.\n\n“This narrative that it’s just a mild virus is not accurate,” Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director for vaccine development at Texas Children’s Hospital, told CNN’s Jake Tapper last week, remarking on the surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations at America’s largest pediatric hospital.\n\n“We’ve just done a terrible job vaccinating our kids across the country. … So even though there’s a lot of happy talk about the Omicron variant, less severe disease, when you add up all the factors … we’ve got a very serious situation facing us in this country, especially for the kids.”\n\nAbout 17% of US children age 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated; the vast majority of children in hospital in the US are unvaccinated, according to CDC director Rochelle Walensky.\n\nTwo years into the pandemic, public health experts have made clear which mitigation measures would make classrooms safer: vaccination, masks in classrooms, regular testing, contact tracing, bubble-systems, isolation and improved ventilation. The World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, said in early December that masks and ventilation, combined with testing, should be a standard in all primary schools and that vaccinating children should be considered nationally.\n\nA health worker administers a Covid-19 shot to a child in Lisbon.

Goncalo Fonseca/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMany EU countries began vaccinating 5- to 11-year-olds in mid-December, but the UK has only recently started rolling out shots to clinically vulnerable children. That has vexed some parents, with British news reports of at least one mother driving to Europe to get her daughter vaccinated.\n\nChristina Pagel, the director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London, said the decision to delay shots for British children was a mistake, one that will set them up for another term of illness, and would put parents and school staff at further risk. Going into the new term, one in 10 children (aged 2 to 11) had Covid-19 in England, compared with one in 15 adults, according to ONS data.\n\n“We’re going to see a big surge in kids. And it’s going to be very, very disruptive,” Pagel said. “Their teachers are going to get it, and probably in about a month or two, their parents are going to get it. We’re going to see a prolonged high level of infection.”\n\nPagel, a member of Independent SAGE, a group of expert scientific advisers unaffiliated with the government, said the British government has been an outlier in its attitude to infections in children and has failed to use mitigation strategies deployed successfully elsewhere – crucially, ventilation and masks.\n\nIn an op-ed for the British Medical Journal, she highlighted the successes of countries like Norway and Japan, which have kept schools open through preventative measures, like spacing out classroom desks, using outdoor spaces as much as possible, avoiding crowding and using rigorous hand-washing practices. Pagel also noted that parts of the US and Europe, including France, Spain, Italy and Germany, have successfully mandated masks for elementary, middle and high school children, with surges in cases when rules were relaxed.\n\nA girl wears winter clothes and a face mask in her aerated classroom at the Petri primary school in Dortmund, western Germany, in late November. Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA recent study in Germany found that requiring children and adults to wear face masks in schools could significantly reduce Covid-19 transmissions and outbreaks, because clusters were generally more severe when an adult was the source. Studies released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have also shown the efficacy of masks in limiting Covid-19 transmission in education settings. One study found that schools in two of Arizona’s most populous counties without mask requirements were 3.5 times more likely to have a Covid-19 outbreak than schools that required all people, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a mask indoors. The CDC recommends universal masking for all schools.\n\nBut even in countries like France, where masks and other mitigative measures are mandated in schools, there are fears that Omicron will run amok in classrooms. A December analysis of protocols in French schools, which used data from the country’s spring wave of infections, found that regular testing and vaccination against Covid-19 were the most effective ways to minimize closures. It also suggests that viral circulation among children in schools is higher than in the general community, resulting in greater risk of infection for students’ household members.\n\nVittoria Colizza, a Paris-based epidemiologist at Inserm, the French public-health research center, and one of the authors of the study, said that in light of Omicron and the threat of even more contagious variants, the situation in schools was set to become more difficult in the coming months. That is why Colizza and other scientists have been pushing for regular testing and vaccinations in children, which began in France last month. “I think much of the problem has been this biased narrative that transmission in schools doesn’t happen, but of course it happens,” she said.\n\nAs students return to school amid Omicron, many scientists and public health experts are asking: If keeping schools open is so important for children, then why are we skimping on measures that could protect them?\n\nA Covid-19 testing site in Albigny-sur-Saone, central France. French schools are struggling amid an Omicron wave, and new testing and tracing rules for classrooms are exacerbating already long lines. Laurent Cipriani/AP\n\n“It’s quite terrifying looking at the number of children who are being infected and hospitalized every week. And the fact that they are going into schools now with a highly transmissible variant with almost no mitigations and with the vast majority unvaccinated,” Dr. Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London, said of the situation in England. “The rhetoric still very much seems to be to keep schools open at all costs … rather than the real discussion we should be having, which is how do we keep schools open safely.\n\n“I’m not even sure many parents realize the sort of risks that children are facing every day. And there are countries that have done so much better than us,” she added, noting successes in Southeast Asia and Western Europe, particularly in curtailing airborne transmission.\n\nThe same strategies that have made Southeast and East Asia so successful at suppressing the virus – widespread mask use, improved ventilation, comprehensive contact testing and tracing programs, and supported isolation – have also allowed them to limit disruption to education, Gurdasani said, flagging public health measures in Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. They’ve also remained dynamic, shifting protective measures depending on cases, and quickly moving to hybrid learning.\n\nIn Europe, the German government invested €500 million ($427 million) in October 2020 in improving ventilation systems in public buildings, including schools, including upgrading air conditioning systems and purifiers, described by the then-Chancellor Angela Merkel as “one of the cheapest and most effective ways” of containing the spread of the virus.\n\nAnd in the US, New York City distributed two air purifiers for every classroom after extensive ventilation surveys, which helped keep its positivity rate around 1%, lower than the city-wide rate of 3%, into December – though that number has since soared to 31% amid the Omicron surge.\n\nBut in England, despite recommendations from advisory groups and scientists to improve ventilation in schools, the government has said repeatedly that there were no funds to do so. Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrats suggested recently that England could fit air filters in all classrooms for £140 million ($190 million) – around half the cost of the new royal yacht.\n\nGurdasani, who is immunosuppressed, was anxious to send her 6-year-old daughter to school this week. She said she had been trying to get HEPA filtration devices into her classroom for six months before a charity agreed to fund them. Her daughter, who has asthma, wore an N95 mask on her first day back – but she was the only one in her class wearing a face covering.\n\n“She’s a shy child, and nobody in her school is wearing masks, nobody at all. And, you know, she feels very out of place, and as a 6-year-old, that’s very hard. But I don’t know what else to do.”", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/04/09/pennsylvania-covid-19-variants-department-health-vaccine/7156310002/", "title": "PA COVID: UK, other variants likely behind surge of new cases in state", "text": "The Pennsylvania Department of Health is refusing to release data about where emerging and more contagious COVID-19 infections are occurring, including one that medical experts are attributing to the recent surge in new cases.\n\nDepartment spokeswoman Maggi Burton acknowledged COVID-19 cases involving variants of the virus are increasing in the state, but she referred questions about counties in which the variants are circulating to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPennsylvania is currently sending biweekly positive COVID samples to the CDC for the complex and time-consuming genome sequencing, a tool that provides the genetic code of a virus and allows scientists to detect mutations.\n\nSeveral commercial and hospital labs have also started sequencing positive specimens and they have identified most of the variants in the state so far, Burton said. She added the department is working to build the infrastructure to do sequencing in-house.\n\nAs of Thursday, the CDC has detected the so-called U.K variant in 672 Pennsylvania COVID-19 cases, more than triple the number as of March 30.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 94.7% of the US population ages 16 and older have antibodies against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 through vaccination, infection, or both.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the United States last week, up from 29% the week before, according to data shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest spreading variants reported to date, and they are expected to dominate Covid-19 transmission in the United States, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe within the next few weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n‘COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further’\n\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine paper, among 27 research participants who had been vaccinated and boosted with the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the researchers found that two weeks after the booster dose, levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron subvariants were much lower than the response against the original coronavirus.\n\nThe neutralizing antibody levels were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 7 against BA.2; by a factor of 14.1 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 21 against BA.4 or BA.5, the researchers described.\n\nAmong 27 participants who had previously been infected with the BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants a median of 29 days earlier, the researchers found similar results.\n\nIn those with previous infection – most of whom also had been vaccinated – the researchers described neutralizing antibody levels that were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 5.8 against BA.2; by a factor of 9.6 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 18.7 against BA.4 or BA.5.\n\nMore research is needed to determine what exactly the neutralizing antibody levels mean for vaccine effectiveness and whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of participants.\n\n“Our data suggest that COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further, resulting in increased transmissibility and increased antibody escape,” Barouch wrote in the email. “As pandemic restrictions are lifted, it is important that we remain vigilant and keep studying new variants and subvariants as they emerge.”\n\nA separate study, published in the journal Nature last week, found that Omicron may evolve mutations to evade the immunity elicited by having a previous BA.1 infection, which suggests that vaccine boosters based on BA.1 may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron subvariants like BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nAs for what all this means in the real world, Dr. Wesley Long, an experimental pathologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told CNN that people should be aware that they could get sick again, even if they’ve had Covid-19 before.\n\n“I think I’m a little bit worried about people who’ve had it maybe recently having a false sense of security with BA.4 and BA.5 on the increase, because we have seen some cases of reinfection and I have seen some cases of reinfection with people who had a BA.2 variant in the last few months,” he said.\n\nSome vaccine makers have been developing variant-specific vaccines to improve the antibody responses against coronavirus variants and subvariants of concern.\n\n“Reinfections are going to be pretty inevitable until we have vaccines or widespread mandates that are going to prevent cases rising again. But the good news is that we are in, I think, a much better spot than we were without the vaccines,” said Pavitra Roychoudhury, an acting instructor at the University of Washington’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, who was not involved in the New England Journal of Medicine paper.\n\n“There’s so much of this virus out there that it seems inevitable,” she said about Covid-19 infections. “Hopefully the protections that we have in place are going to lead to mostly mild infection.”\n\nEfforts underway to update Covid-19 vaccines\n\nModerna’s bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster, named mRNA-1273.214, elicited a “potent” immune responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThis bivalent booster vaccine candidate contains components of both Moderna’s original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the Omicron variant. The company said it is working to complete regulatory submissions in the coming weeks requesting to update the composition of its booster vaccine to be mRNA-1273.214.\n\n“In the face of SARS-CoV-2’s continued evolution, we are very encouraged that mRNA-1273.214, our lead booster candidate for the fall, has shown high neutralizing titers against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which represent an emergent threat to global public health,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in Wednesday’s announcement. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\n“We will submit these data to regulators urgently and are preparing to supply our next generation bivalent booster starting in August, ahead of a potential rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections due to Omicron subvariants in the early fall,” Bancel said.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting next week to discuss the composition of Covid-19 vaccines that could be used as boosters this fall.\n\nThe data that Moderna released Wednesday, which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed that one month after a 50-microgram dose of the mRNA-1273.214 vaccine was administered in people who had been vaccinated and boosted, the vaccine elicited “potent” neutralizing antibody responses against BA.4 and BA.5, boosting levels 5.4-fold in all participants regardless of whether they had a prior Covid-19 infection and by 6.3-fold in the subset of those with no history of prior infection. These levels of neutralizing antibodies were about 3-fold lower than previously reported neutralizing levels against BA.1, Moderna said.\n\nThese findings add to the data that Moderna previously released earlier this month, showing that the 50-microgram dose of the bivalent booster generated a stronger antibody response against Omicron than the original Moderna vaccine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nModerna’s data suggest that “the bivalent booster might confer greater protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron strains than readministering the original vaccine to increase protection across the population. Although the information is based on antibody levels, the companies comment that similar levels of antibody protected against clinical illness caused by other strains is the first suggestion of an emerging ‘immune correlate’ of protection, although it is hoped that this ongoing study is also assessing rates of clinical illness as well as antibody responses,” Penny Ward, an independent pharmaceutical physician and visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday. She was not involved in Moderna’s work.\n\n“It has been reported previously that the bivalent vaccine is well tolerated with temporary ‘reactogenic’ effects similar to those following the univalent booster injection so we can anticipate that this new mixed vaccine should be well tolerated,” Ward said in part. “As we head towards the autumn with omicron variants dominating the covid infection landscape, it certainly makes sense to consider use of this new bivalent vaccine, if available.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/15/covid-news-california-new-york-coronavirus-variants-cdc/4483780001/", "title": "COVID cases, news: Variants surge; IRS tax deadline; Israel vaccine", "text": "A potential surge in COVID-19 cases caused by a new variant of the coronavirus could make it difficult for schools to reopen despite the new guidelines released by the Biden administration last week, a leading infectious diseases epidemiologist said Monday.\n\nMichael Osterholm, the head of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and a Biden transition adviser on COVID-19, said the spiking number of U.K. variant cases may mean that \"a lot of schools are going to be challenged to open at all.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday released new guidelines for school reopenings that include a host of safety guidelines, including mask wearing and maintaining 6 feet of physical distance between people when possible.

Experts blame the pandemic.\n\nMany Americans stayed away from the emergency room when the nation went under lockdown for fear of contracting COVID-19 at the hospital. While this led to an overall decline in emergency department visits, a recent study shows weekly trips to the ER for drug overdoses were higher in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nResearchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied more than 180 million ER visits from Dec. 30, 2018, to Oct. 10, 2020, and found that weekly counts of all drug overdoses were up to 45% higher in 2020 than in 2019, according to the study published Feb. 3 in the peer-reviewed JAMA Psychiatry. Opioid overdoses, specifically, increased about 29% compared to before the pandemic.\n\nOverall visits to the emergency room plummeted when COVID-19 lockdown measures were implemented in March 2020, decreasing about 43% compared to the same timeframe in 2019. However, drug overdoses experienced only a slight decrease from March 29 to April 11, about 4% compared to 2019, before increasing again.\n\n“That all drug and opioid overdose emergency department visits did not decrease in a similar manner to other emergency department visits is especially compelling, suggesting an increase in overdose burden during the pandemic,” study authors said.\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nWHO finds signs of wider outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019, report says\n\nThe World Health Organization team of scientists investigating the origins of the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic in China has found signs that the original outbreak in Wuhan was wider than previously thought, the lead investigator told CNN.\n\nPeter Ben Embarek, who led the WHO mission, told CNN that investigators had found several clues that point to a larger outbreak in the central Chinese city, including evidence of over a dozen strains of the virus already circulating in December 2019.\n\nA preliminary report from Ben Embarek and a team of WHO scientists who recently concluded a trip to China is expected this week.\n\nPfizer-BioNTech vaccine effective in reducing symptomatic infection, Israeli study finds\n\nAn Israeli study of 1.2 million people found that Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduced symptomatic infections by 94% and cases of serious disease by 92%, one of the country's largest health care providers said.\n\nThe study by Clalit looked at 600,000 people who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 600,000 who were not immunized.\n\n\"The efficacy of the vaccine is preserved in every age group,\" particularly a week after the second dose of the vaccine, researchers said, adding that the aim of the study was \"emphasizing to the population that has yet to vaccinate that the vaccine is highly effective and prevents serious illness.\"\n\nVariant cases surge in US, including new reports in Maine, Illinois, Texas\n\nCOVID-19 variants continue to infiltrate the U.S.: The B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the United Kingdom has been reported for the first time in Maine, New Hampshire and Washington, D.C., while the B.1.351 variant first seen in South Africa has now been reported in Illinois, Texas and D.C.\n\nThe B.1.1.7 variant is spreading rapidly. Michigan had been reporting 29 cases since Feb. 4; on Sunday night, it reported another 32 cases, more than doubling its load. Florida also reported 32 new cases, bringing its total to 379, or about a third of the nation's. California reported 27 new cases, bringing its total to 186. Colorado added 26 cases to reach 67; Massachusetts added 19 cases to nearly triple its reported tally, to 29. Texas added 14 cases to reach 49.\n\nThere are now 1,173 known cases of B.1.1.7, which the Centers for Disease Control had said could become the country's predominate strain in March. The rapid spread of variants is happening even as all coronavirus case counts are being reported half as quickly as they were last month.\n\n– Mike Stucka\n\nNew Orleans gets tough with Mardi Gras celebrations\n\nNew Orleans is tamping down its annual Mardi Gras celebrations this week and health officials in other cities are warning would-be revelers to do the same amid a spike in coronavirus variant cases across the nation.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell ordered bars closed during the Mardi Gras weekend that started Friday and runs through Tuesday.

Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, calls these many new lineages “Scrabble variants” because they contain letters like X and Q that get high scores in the game.\n\nThe new variants descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, but they have evolved to share some of the same changes in their genomes that help them slip past our immunity against the virus.\n\nThe gaggle of new variants have been gaining ground against BA.5, which has dominated Covid-19 infections in the United States since July. BA.5 now accounts for 49.6% of new infections in this country.\n\nTwo variants, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, have been growing especially fast. At the beginning of October, each one accounted for about 1% of new infections in the United States, but they have been roughly doubling in prevalence each week. Together, they now account for more than 1 in 4 new Covid-19 infections nationwide, according to CDC data.\n\nBQ.1 is causing about 14% of new infections; BQ.1.1. is causing 13% of new infections. BA.4.6 is causing another 10%. BF.7 accounts for 7.5% of newly diagnosed Covid-19. A slew of other new variants accounts for smaller pieces of the Covid-19 pie.\n\nThese variants are not evenly distributed across the US. BQ.1.1 is now causing about 1 in 5 new Covid-19 infections in the Northeast, where cases and hospitalizations are rising. But that strain is causing just 3% of new Covid-19 infections in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThese variants are slightly different from each other, but they all carry some of the same key mutations that help them skirt immunity from vaccines and past infections.

It is particularly widespread in Singapore, where it is now the dominant circulating strain.\n\n“The two sublineages remain part of Omicron, which continues to be a variant of concern,” the group said in a statement.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/health/updated-boosters-fall/index.html", "title": "Updated Covid-19 boosters are expected in September. Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis fall, Americans could get boosted with a mRNA Covid-19 vaccine unlike any that’s come before.\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna are working on bivalent boosters: vaccines made up of both the old formula and a new one that targets the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the coronavirus.\n\nIf the shots meet US Food and Drug Administration standards, they will probably be available as early as September, the FDA says.\n\nBut cases are high now. There are about 124,000 new cases reported each day – far from the levels reported during the Omicron surge, but nearing peak case rates from the Delta wave – and cases are more undercounted than ever.\n\nSome experts wonder whether the Omicron-specific boosters will come in time to make a difference and if they will actually offer more protection than the current shots.\n\nA prediction game\n\nThe current shots are based on the original strain of the virus and offered nearly full protection, even from infection, early on. With new variants in circulation, the vaccines still are good at keeping people out of the hospital, but most scientists think people need a vaccine that offers more protection.\n\nDr. Michael Chang, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston, thinks vaccines with an Omicron component will be helpful – within limits.\n\n“I just wish that the timing had been sooner so that we could actually be dealing with the kind of BA.5 surge that we have right now,” he said.\n\nWith the highly contagious BA.5 subvariant now dominant, the goal of minimizing the number of infections is “kind of lost,” but the new vaccines should help keep hospitalizations and deaths down, Chang said.\n\n“I do think, anytime you can introduce additional strains or variants into a vaccine, the human body’s immune response tends to be a little bit broader and more durable and potentially longer-lasting,” he said.\n\nBut it’s impossible to know at this point what variant will be dominant a couple months from now, how different it will be from the currently circulating variants or even how many cases there will be, because it’s hard to predict how humans will behave when cases rise – and cases will most likely rise. Much like with the flu, scientists think the coronavirus transmits more efficiently in colder weather. It also spreads more easily as people spend more time indoors.\n\nDr. Edward Michelson, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, is seeing many patients again, even those who had Omicron earlier in the year.\n\n“Omicron is not protecting people even a few months after they got sick with it. These subvariants are getting them again, much to my surprise,” Michelson said. “The good news is, most of the patients don’t need hospitalization.”\n\nStill, 375 people are dying of Covid-related causes on average every day in the US, according to the CDC.\n\n‘A new vaccine could really pay dividends’\n\nThe Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, a group of scientists across the country who create projections for the coming year, predicts an upswing in hospitalizations through early fall. But the model suggests that a booster campaign will make a dent in these numbers, according to Justin Lessler, a University of North Carolina epidemiologist who works with the group.\n\nWhile scientists are still trying to determine exactly how well the new vaccines will protect people, Lessler said, the model assumes that the reformulated vaccine would have about 80% efficacy against infection with the currently circulating strains. But that depends on how many people actually get an updated booster.\n\n“Absent any real new variants, that kind of efficacy would be enough to really tamp down the current circulation if we have a broad uptake of the vaccines,” Lessler said. “A new vaccine could really pay dividends, particularly if we can get it to a broad swath of the population.”\n\nIdeally, public health campaigns could be built to encourage people to get a flu vaccine and a Covid-19 vaccine at the same time, he said.\n\nLessler presented an earlier version of the model to the FDA’s independent vaccine advisers, who voted in June to recommend that the vaccine makers include BA.4 and BA.5 in the fall booster. They said that including an Omicron element would offer more protection.\n\n“While it’s impossible for anyone to predict which variants will be circulating at the time, the goal as I see it is to add the subvariants that are most likely to give us that broad spectrum of antibodies that will hopefully prevent serious disease, which is really what we’re trying to do,” said Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n\nEurope’s approach\n\nSome countries may go with vaccines based on the BA.1 Omicron subvariant this fall. It’s not fully understood to what extent the sublineages of Omicron influence vaccine effectiveness, but some scientists who advise the World Health Organization argued that BA.1-based shots would be “more distinct” than other subvariants.\n\nModerna said it’s developing a booster for the European Union, the UK and Australia that uses the original strain and BA.1. The subvariant is largely extinct, but the company said its studies have shown that this booster candidate still drew “significantly higher neutralizing antibody responses” against BA.4 and BA.5 compared with the currently authorized booster.\n\nPfizer has said it too will make a vaccine that fits Europe’s needs, as well as the needs in the US.\n\n“Our program continues to focus on all variants of concern and we remain committed to the public health needs as defined by regulators, Europe and elsewhere,” a spokesperson for Pfizer told CNN in an email.\n\nPfizer submitted its bivalent BA.1-specific vaccine to the European Medicines Agency in mid-July and told CNN it will be ready to distribute this fall, pending authorization.\n\nIn the United States, a vaccine updated for BA.4/5 got the go-ahead for fall.\n\nDr. Larry Corey, a vaccine development expert and professor of medicine and infectious disease division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said the data makes a strong case for the addition. Research on infections shows that the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants seem to induce stronger immune response than BA.1 and BA.2.\n\n“We don’t have the data yet. Certainly, we will know by the end of August,” Corey said.\n\nAs with so much during the pandemic, scientists are making educated guesses and figuring things out as they go.\n\n“We’ll start sleeping better in a month, see whether it does well in animals, and we’ll feel we made the right decision when we boost a bunch of people with the BA.4/BA.5 variants,” Corey said.\n\nA virus that breaks all the rules\n\nEven as the virus changes, there is only so much vaccine makers can do, says University of Michigan epidemiologist Arnold Monto, who has served as acting chair of the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel.\n\n“Basically, we can only use those viruses that we know about,” Monto said.\n\nOmicron was a big change from previous variants, he said, and most evolutionary virologists don’t think there will be such a big leap again. Rather, the changes will probably be along the Omicron lines.\n\nBut then again, “this has been a tricky virus. It has broken all the rules.”\n\nRegardless, Monto is confident that adding the BA.4/BA.5 element to the new vaccines will help.\n\n“While we know that the latest viruses that we are encountering that will go into the vaccine probably are not going to the be the viruses in the coming fall and winter, the answer is not to chase them but to try and catch up and broaden them,” he said.\n\nIn other words, vaccine makers will want to have a wide a distribution of immunity in the population. That’s why they’ll continue to include the original strain as well as Omicron.\n\nIt seems possible that we’ll be facing different variants in the fall, but Dr. Eric Rubin, an adjunct professor of immunology and infectious disease at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said there is a “very reasonable argument” that having some diversity in the immune response is still a good thing.\n\n“For me, the most important thing we can measure right now is the breadth of immunity and not try to guess which strain is going to be there. That’s probably more important than trying to guess what comes up in the fall,” said Rubin, who is also on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee but was not a part of the Omicron booster discussion.\n\nEvolution is trying to find its own path, however, and the virus will do whatever works for it as opposed to us.

It also comes amid a spate of layoffs at other tech firms in recent months as the high-flying sector reacts to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession.\n\n“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.”\n\nThe job cuts will impact many corners of the company, but Meta’s recruiting team will be hit particularly hard as “we’re planning to hire fewer people next year,” Zuckerberg said in the post. He added that a hiring freeze would be extended until the first quarter, with few exceptions.\n\nIn September, Meta had a headcount of more than 87,000, per a September SEC filing.\n\nMeta’s core ad sales business has been hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple, advertisers tightening budgets and heightened competition from newer rivals like TikTok. Meanwhile, Meta has been spending billions to build a future version of the internet, dubbed the metaverse, that likely remains years away from widespread acceptance.\n\nLast month, the company posted its second quarterly revenue decline and said that its profit was cut in half from the prior year. Once valued at more than $1 trillion last year, Meta’s market value has since plunged to around $250 billion.\n\n“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post Wednesday. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”\n\nShares of Meta rose 5% in trading Wednesday following the announcement.\n\nMeta is not alone in feeling the pain of a market downturn. The tech sector has been facing a dizzying reality check as inflation, rising interest rates and more macroeconomic headwinds have led to a stunning shift in spending for an industry that only grew more dominant as consumers shifted more of their lives online during the pandemic.\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\n“I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he added.\n\nMeta’s headcount in September was nearly twice the 48,268 staffers it had at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020.\n\nA handful of tech companies have announced hiring freezes or job cuts in recent months, often after having seen rapid growth during the pandemic. Last week, rideshare company Lyft said it was axing 13% of employees, and payment-processing firm Stripe said it was cutting 14% of its staff. The same day, e-commerce giant Amazon said it was implementing a pause on corporate hiring.\n\nAlso last week, Facebook-rival Twitter announced mass layoffs impacting roles across the company as its new owner, Elon Musk, took the helm.\n\nIn addition to the layoffs, Zuckerberg said the company expects to “roll out more cost-cutting changes” in the coming months. Meta, which like other tech giants is known for its vast, perk-filled offices, is rethinking its real estate needs, he said, and “transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office.”\n\n“Overall,” he said, “this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/tech/twitter-employees-ultimatum-deadline/index.html", "title": "After Elon Musk's 'extremely hardcore' work ultimatum Twitter ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAnother employee exodus appears to be underway at Twitter as many workers rejected Elon Musk’s terms for staying with the company, choosing instead to depart, according to multiple current and former employees.\n\nAs the deadline approached for Twitter employees to respond to Elon Musk’s ultimatum to commit to working in an “extremely hardcore” fashion at the company or leave, some employees appeared to publicly indicate they had chosen the latter option. On Thursday afternoon, Twitter staffers began posting the salute emoji, which has become a signal that someone is exiting the company. One Twitter employee said in a tweet that deciding to join the company was “one of the easiest decisions ever made. Deciding to leave today was 100% the opposite.”\n\nMeanwhile, an internal Slack channel at the company was filled with employees posting the salute emoji after the 5pm ET deadline, indicating they had chosen not to sign Musk’s pledge and depart the company, employees told CNN.\n\nTwitter’s remaining workforce had until 5 p.m. ET on Thursday to decide whether they wanted to be a part of the culture Musk wants to implement at the social media company, or else effectively resign, according to an email he sent to staff Wednesday.\n\nA former Twitter executive who recently exited the company described Thursday’s employee exits as a “mass exodus.”\n\nOn Thursday evening following the exits, employees remaining at the company received an email alerting them that the company’s offices will be temporarily closed and badge access will be restricted through Monday, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN from a current Twitter employee. Musk’s team similarly shuttered offices during the mass layoffs earlier this month out of a concern for safety and an apparent fear that exiting employees could attempt to sabotage the company on their way out.\n\nTwo Twitter employees told CNN ahead of the deadline on Thursday that they planned to reject the ultimatum, citing a toxic work environment they say the billionaire has introduced. Another Twitter employee told CNN Wednesday they were still weighing the decision, saying the email from Musk “felt like a punch in the gut because no matter how you felt about wanting to stay or wanting to go, you were forced to make a decision and feel like you’re up against the time clock to make the best decision for you and your family.”\n\nThe employee added: “Those decisions are more than just 24 hours.”\n\nMusk told employees on Wednesday that his goal is to build “Twitter 2.0” and that employees who choose to stay will be required to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and presumably agreeing to Musk’s demand for Twitter employees, who have been largely working remotely, to return to in-office work. As of midday Thursday, employees still did not have clarity on which remote-work exceptions would be granted if they decide to stay, one employee said.\n\nLater on Thursday, amid an apparent scramble by management to avoid losing too many workers to the ultimatum, Musk sent an email to staff attempting to clarify his position on remote work, according to text of the email obtained by CNN from a Twitter employee who asked not to be identified.\n\n“Regarding remote work, all that is required for approval is that your manager takes responsibility for ensuring that you are making an excellent contribution,” Musk said in the email, adding that workers would be expected to attend in-person meetings no less than once a month.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Musk sent a follow up email saying: “At risk of stating the obvious, any manager who falsely claims that someone reporting to them is doing excellent work or that a given role is essential, whether remote or not, will be exited from the company.”\n\nThe decision to issue an ultimatum came after Musk earlier this month fired half of Twitter’s staff, reducing its workforce to around 3,700 employees, and also reportedly cut many of Twitter’s contract workers. He also pushed out its top leadership and dissolved the board of directors. Musk also recently fired some employees for criticizing him in tweets or on internal Slack channels.\n\n“I don’t want to stick around to build a product that’s being poisoned from the inside and out,” said one of the employees who plans to reject the ultimatum, but requested anonymity to avoid putting the severance at risk. “Everyone has a price to a certain degree and this severance gives me some comfort into looking for a better environment in the time frame despite the economy.”\n\nThat employee said management now appears to have grown concerned about the number of people planning to depart and are “scrambling” to convince talent to stay. Twitter, which has reportedly eliminated most of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Twitter employee, who asked not to be quoted, shared similar concerns and said they planned to also exit the company.\n\nA recently laid off employee who remains in touch with former coworkers told CNN that everyone they had spoken to plans to reject Musk’s ultimatum and exit the company. “People can’t overlook the public mockery and firing of other employees,” the former employee told CNN. “In the same vein, they can’t overlook or feel comfortable working for someone who has handled the last few weeks in the way Elon has.”\n\n“People don’t want to sacrifice their mental health and family lives to make the richest man in the world richer,” the former employee added.\n\nBut the decision may not be so easy for others. The ultimatum comes during a difficult period for the tech industry, following mass layoffs and hiring freeze announcements at many major firms including Meta, Amazon, Lyft and others. Employees working in the United States from other countries could also risk losing their work visas if they leave the company.\n\nA fourth employee told CNN Thursday they plan to stay at the company “because change is rarely influenced from the outside.”\n\nThe shakeup likely to come as a result of the ultimatum will be the last element of the “fundamental organizational restructuring” following Musk’s takeover, he told a Delaware court Wednesday during a trial over his Tesla pay package.\n\nMusk said in the Wednesday email that the “new Twitter” will be “much more engineering-driven,” leaving some non-engineering workers questioning whether their jobs could be at risk even if they opt to stay.\n\n“There’s no assurance in this, you’re just like, ‘I might be able to advocate for myself, I might not,’” the employee who expressed uncertainty about the decision said. “What’s behind this door? You don’t know. The only door you know that’s certain is the exit door.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Oliver Darcy", "Clare Duffy", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/tech/amazon-layoffs-report/index.html", "title": "Amazon layoffs: Company plans to lay off thousands of employees ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nAmazon is planning to lay off some 10,000 employees in corporate and technology jobs, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe job cuts could start as early as this week, and will likely include staff working on Amazon (AMZN) devices (such as its voice-assistant Alexa), as well as people in its retail and human resources divisions, according to the report. “The total number of layoffs remains fluid,” the report stated.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment Monday. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. The Wall Street Journal also reported Monday that Amazon is set to lay off thousands of workers, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe news would make Amazon the latest in a spate of tech companies that have announced significant layoffs in recent weeks, amid broader economic uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in the demand many tech giants saw during the pandemic that led them to quickly add staff. Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it is laying off 11,000 employees.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon said it was freezing corporate hiring “for the next few months,” citing economic uncertainty and “how many people we have hired” in recent years. Amazon rapidly grew its headcount as the pandemic shifted consumer habits and spending towards e-commerce. In its most-recent earnings report, however, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected.\n\nShares in Amazon have fallen more than 40% in 2022 so far amid a broader market decline.\n\nNews of potential layoffs comes at a crucial time for the retail industry, ahead of the holiday shopping season. Despite recession fears and inflationary pressures, the National Retail Federation is predicting a 6% to 8% sales increase from last year during the holiday shopping months.\n\nLast month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos tweeted about the possibility of a looming recession, writing, “the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.” In an interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday, Bezos said that advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike. “Take some risk off the table,” he said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/tech/apple-china/index.html", "title": "Apple made China the backbone of its iPhone assembly. Shifting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn early November, weeks before the peak holiday shopping season was about to kick off, Apple issued an unusual warning: customers would have to wait longer for the new iPhone 14 Pro models. That’s because one of its key assembly facilities in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou was “operating at significantly reduced capacity” due to Covid curbs.\n\nFor years, Apple has relied on a vast manufacturing network in China to mass produce the iPhone, iPad and other popular products found in households around the world. But its dependance on the country has been tested this year by China’s “zero-Covid” strategy and strict lockdowns, including recently at the so-called iPhone City production hub in Zhengzhou.\n\nNow, the world’s most valuable tech company is reportedly seeking to accelerate plans to shift production out of the world’s most populous country – but reducing its significant dependency on China could take years, if it ever happens at all. In an investor note earlier this week, one analyst at Wedbush Securities estimated it would take Apple until at least 2025 or 2026 to move the majority of its iPhone production to markets like India and Vietnam, but only if it “moves aggressively.”\n\nGad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School whose research focuses on operations and supply chain management, appeared to have an even more conservative assessment of the timetable. “I don’t think we can talk about any meaningful change beyond a few percent before 2025,” Allon said.\n\nTo get a sense of how crucial China is to Apple: Prior to the Covid outbreak in October that prompted shutdowns in Zhengzhou, that manufacturing plant was producing 85% of the iPhone Pros, according to an estimate from market research firm Counterpoint, provided to CNN.\n\n“Apple would not be the company that it is today without China as a manufacturing base,” said Eli Friedman, a professor at Cornell University whose research focuses on labor and development in China. Even as Apple signals it wants to shift production away from China, Friedman said, “It’s not going to entail a decoupling from China – there’s going to be Apple products that are made in China for a very long time.”\n\nUltimately, Apple is “in some ways as much a Chinese company as it is an American company,” Friedman said, “although, of course, it is headquartered in the States.”\n\nApple did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nThere are a range of crucial factors that go into assembling and producing iPhones, for example, “that just can’t be replicated in other countries,” he said. This includes availability of materials and components from nearby suppliers; world-class infrastructure that is already in place at scale; access to a large labor force of engineers as well as low labor costs; and availability of the swaths of land necessary to build the factory-cities that can house hundreds of thousands of workers as well as the sprawling production facilities.\n\n“Other countries might have one piece or another of this, but they don’t have all of them,” said Friedman.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who helped build the company’s global supply chain, acknowledged the unique manufacturing strengths of China in one 2015 interview. “You can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in,” he said. “In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.”\n\nSteve Jobs, Apple’s late CEO, brought the labor issue up during an October 2010 meeting with President Obama. He called America’s lackluster education system an obstacle for Apple, which needed 30,000 industrial engineers to support its on-site factory workers at the time.\n\n“You can’t find that many in America to hire,” Jobs told the president, according to his biographer, Walter Isaacson. “If you could educate these engineers, we could move more manufacturing plants here.”\n\nApple, for example, has been suggesting that it will move production to India for some time now. It said in September that it had started making its new iPhone 14 in India though contract manufacturers including Foxconn, the company which runs iPhone City in Zhengzhou. Foxconn announced on Thursday that it was investing $500 million in its Indian unit as it seeks to diversify production beyond China.\n\nWhile India has a large labor force, and many workers with the necessary technical skills (unlike the United States, which has long been facing a shortage of engineers), creating sprawling assembly hubs for Apple in India faces a lot more red tape than in China. “At least in India, accessing land is not nearly as easy,” Friedman said, noting how the Chinese Communist Party faces fewer barriers to expropriating land quickly for causes it deems important. Labor costs in China, while on the rise over the past decade, are also “artificially cheap because of political repression against labor organizers,” according to Friedman.\n\nIn Vietnam, another long-rumored candidate for Apple to move production to, “the government does have a little bit more capacity, but there’s a lot less land,” according to Friedman. Vietnam also has a significantly smaller population (98 million) compared to both China (1.4 billion) and India (nearly 1.4 billion, per World Bank data).\n\nAnother key element to why Apple “is really reluctant to rock the boat with China is that China is also a massive market for Apple,” according to Wharton’s Allon. Apple reported $74 billion in sales in the Greater China market during the 12-month period ending in September, or nearly 20% of its global sales for the year.\n\n“If you look at other American [tech] firms, Google is not in China, Meta is not in China, Amazon is not in China,” Allon said, noting that Apple has really been the only one to successfully tap into the lucrative market. “So Apple is very reluctant and very careful to make sure that, definitely now as things are very, very sensitive, not to rock the boat – or at least not to rock the boat in a public way.”\n\nThe company may not be able to afford being as reliant as it is on China’s supply chain but neither can it afford to leave the country behind.\n\n— Juliana Liu contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/27/tech/elon-musk-one-month-twitter/index.html", "title": "Layoffs, ultimatums, and an ongoing saga over blue check marks ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSunday officially marks one month since the world’s richest man took the helm at Twitter.\n\nIn that time, Elon Musk initiated mass layoffs and gave remaining staffers a cryptic ultimatum, reinstated the accounts of controversial figures including former President Donald Trump, and launched – then punted – a plan to charge for Twitter’s iconic blue checkmarks.\n\nAfter spending months embroiled in an unsuccessful legal battle to get out of his initial proposal to buy Twitter, Musk made his first splashy entrance into the company’s offices on Oct. 26, carrying a sink. (In a video of the incident shared on Twitter, he wrote: “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!)\n\nSince then, the billionaire has seemingly left no stone unturned during his whirlwind first month as “Chief Twit.” Here is a look at the range of ways Musk (who is still, simultaneously, CEO of his other companies Tesla and SpaceX) has already left his mark on one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk clears out C-suite, then cuts approximately half of Twitter’s staff\n\nAlmost immediately after Musk completed his drama-plagued $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, he fired former CEO Parag Agrawal and other executives. He then made himself the CEO and sole director of the platform, per a securities filing.\n\nThe dramatic leadership shakeup, however, was only the first taste of the major staffing overhaul to come. Musk began wide-ranging layoffs across the company, reducing its overall headcount by roughly 50% in the span of a couple of days.\n\nOn the eve of Nov. 3 and into Nov. 4, numerous now-former Twitter employees began posting on the platform that they had been locked out of their company email accounts as the job cuts began to play out in a very dramatic, public manner.\n\nThe layoffs impacted departments including ethical AI, marketing and communication, search, public policy, and more. As the workers said goodbye to their colleagues online (many sharing blue hearts and salute emojis to signal they had lost their jobs at Twitter), Musk remained largely silent, at least on the job cuts.\n\nIn another dramatic move by the new boss, Musk publicly fired a software engineer who had survived the initial round of cuts, but who then questioned Musk on Twitter.\n\nMusk gives ultimatum to remaining employees: Do ‘extremely hardcore’ work or leave\n\nIn a late-night internal email after the mass staff cuts, Musk asked Twitter’s remaining employees to commit to “extremely hardcore” work or else leave the company with severance pay.\n\n“Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore,” Musk wrote in the memo sent out on Nov. 16. “This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.”\n\nIn the memo, Musk goes on to outline how Twitter will be “much more engineering-driven” and then gives staff an ultimatum. “If you are sure that you want to be part of the new Twitter, please click yes on the link below,” directing staff to what appears to be an online form.\n\nMusk said any employee who has not done so by 5 p.m. ET on the following day, Thursday, would receive three months severance.\n\nAdvertisers flee, and Musk decries ‘massive drop in revenue’\n\nIn the shadow of the mass exodus of workers, a departure of advertisers was also brewing.\n\nSince Musk’s takeover, a handful of brands – ranging from General Mills to the North Face to the Volkswagen Group – confirmed a pause in advertising on the social network as civil society organizations raised new concern over the direction of the company under Musk.\n\nApproximately a week after he took over the company, Musk said that it had seen a “massive drop in revenue.”\n\n“Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” he said in a tweet on Nov. 4. “Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.”\n\nAn ongoing saga over blue check marks kicks off\n\nAnother aspect of Twitter that Musk quickly upended is one of the platform’s most familiar features for its users: the verified blue check marks that had long been used to confirm the authenticity of government officials, journalists, and other public figures.\n\n“Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullsh*t,” Musk tweeted on Nov. 1. “Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.”\n\nSure enough, on Nov. 5, Twitter launched an updated version of its iOS app that allowed users to pay a monthly subscription fee to receive a blue check mark on their profiles. The update, as outlined on Apple’s App Store at the time, stated that users would now have to pay $7.99 per month for the company’s Twitter Blue subscription to receive a check mark on the platform, “just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians you already follow.”\n\nWithin days of the rollout of the subscription service, Twitter was inundated with a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators who quickly gamed the new system to pose as brands and prominent figures.\n\nChaos ensued. In one viral example, a fake account, which featured a newly purchased blue check mark, purporting to be pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly tweeted that a critical diabetes drug would now be free.\n\nIn the wake of the mayhem, Musk ultimately announced that it would delay the rollout of the subscription service until the end of the month.\n\n“Punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid,” Musk tweeted on Nov. 15.\n\nOn Nov. 24 Musk gave a slightly different target date for the relaunch, Dec. 2, and offered more details about the future service, including a range of check mark colors to denote the type of verified account.\n\nTwitter restores some previously banned accounts, including Donald Trump’s\n\nOn Nov. 19, Musk restored the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, nearly two years after it had been permanently banned following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe move came shortly after Twitter restored the accounts of several other controversial, previously banned or suspended users, including conservative Canadian podcaster Jordan Peterson, right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee, comedian Kathy Griffin and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nAhead of restoring Trump’s Twitter account, Musk posted a poll asking the platform’s users if Trump should be reinstated – where a slim majority (51.8%) voted in favor of it.\n\n“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei.” (Latin for “the voice of the people is the voice of God.”).\n\nTrump has previously said he would remain on his own platform, Truth Social, instead of rejoining Twitter, and has yet to tweet since his account came back online.\n\nBut a change in his approach could hold major political implications as Trump has said he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\nMusk goes onto to grant ‘amnesty’ to most previously banned accounts\n\nAfter conducting yet another Twitter poll, Musk said on Nov. 24 that he will begin restoring most previously banned accounts on Twitter starting next week. This would mark his most far-reaching move yet to undo the social media platform’s policy of permanently suspending users who repeatedly violated its rules.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Day announcement came after most respondents voted in favor of his poll over whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.”\n\nOnce again, Musk tweeted that “the people have spoken.”\n\nHis recent decisions to reinstate previously banned accounts, based on the results of his polls on the platform, is notably at odds with how Musk previously said he would handle such choices.\n\nJust a day after his takeover of Twitter, Musk said that the social media company “will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.”\n\n“No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,” Musk added\n\nIt is not immediately clear if that council was ever created, convened, or involved in the decision-making behind bringing back Trump and formerly banned accounts.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/business/google-ai-engineer-fired-sentient/index.html", "title": "Google fires engineer Blake Lemoine who contended its AI ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nGoogle (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.\n\nBlake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA had reached a level of consciousness after exchanging thousands of messages with it.\n\nGoogle confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June.

I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me.

Margaret Mitchell, a leader of Google’s Ethical AI team, was fired in early 2021 after her outspokenness regarding Gebru. Gebru and Mitchell had raised concerns over AI technology, saying they warned Google people could believe the technology is sentient.\n\nOn June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.”\n\n“It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said in a statement.\n\nLemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/success/job-scams/index.html", "title": "Job scams are on the rise.

Some will try to gain access to your personal information, while others might solicit payments from you or hire you for an illegal task, such as reshipping luxury goods that were bought using stolen credit cards.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a job, here are some of the red flags experts say to look for when reviewing potential opportunities:\n\nThe job post is flashy, but offers few details\n\nIn a job seekers’ market, employers are trying to stand out. But if a job posting is all about making money quickly or other big promises – proceed with caution.\n\n“If a job ad is using too-good-to-be-true terms like: ‘quick money,’ or ‘unlimited earnings potential,’ or ‘laptop for free’ and has very few skill requirements … and a lot of caps and images to distract you, it just doesn’t come across professionally,” said Sara Sutton, CEO and founder of FlexJobs.\n\nIf you are unsure of the legitimacy of a post, check to see if you can find the opening posted directly on the company’s website.\n\nYou have questions, but they don’t have the answers\n\nGetting a call from a recruiter is flattering, but make sure they are who they say they are – especially if it’s for a job you didn’t apply for.\n\n“Pay attention to the questions they are asking you,” said Sutton. “If the recruiter is offering you a job very quickly without verifying your work experience or asking for references and moving very, very quickly – those are also red flags.”\n\nIf the job description was overly vague, be sure to ask for more details about the position, duty expectations and experience requirements.\n\n“They will definitely run from you when you start asking more questions,” said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter. “If they start giving you inconsistent answers or not answering your questions properly, you know that’s not a real job.”\n\nSutton added that scammers can fraudulently use a company’s name and recommended to check the recruiter’s email is legit. For instance, if the domain is “company-inc.com” versus “company.com,” she advised looking online to see what the company uses.\n\nThey ask for personal information\n\nJob applications tend to include questions like your name, address, contact information and work experience, but it shouldn’t go much deeper than that.\n\n“If they are asking you to provide personal information upfront during the interview stages, like your Social Security number for a background check … no legitimate company asks for a background check or Social Security number during the interview stage. That happens after you are hired,” said Buber.\n\nBefore giving out any personal information, Perkins recommended doing some online research. “Look up the name of the company, the person who claims to be hiring you, plus the word ‘scam,’ ‘review,’ or ‘complaint’… and don’t trust reviews on the company’s website. Those could be fake.”\n\nThey ask for payment\n\nThe only conversation you should be having with a potential employer about money should be about compensation. If they ask you to pay any fees for things like special services, training or software or equipment, that should be a major red flag.\n\n“Don’t pay for the promise of a job, don’t make an upfront payment to get a job – only scammers will ask you to do that,” said Perkins.\n\nThere’s also a fake check scam that can involve a bogus company sending you too large a check for you to buy something like computer equipment and then asks you to repay the excess funds via a wire transfer service, cryptocurrency or gift cards.\n\nThese forms of sending money are hard for law enforcement to trace and people to get their money back, Perkins explained.\n\n“Under the law, banks are required to make the money available quickly, so when you deposit a check and it looks like it’s cleared that doesn’t mean it’s a good check,” said Perkins. “The bank will find out later it’s a bad check.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/tech/openai-google-realistic-images-bias/index.html", "title": "AI made these stunning images. Here's why experts are worried ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA million bears walking on the streets of Hong Kong. A strawberry frog. A cat made out of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThese are just a few of the text descriptions that people have fed to cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems in recent weeks, which these systems — notably OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Google Research’s Imagen — can use to produce incredibly detailed, realistic-looking images.\n\nThe resulting pictures can be silly, strange, or even reminiscent of classic art, and they’re being shared widely (and sometimes breathlessly) on social media, including by influential figures in the tech community. DALL-E 2 (which is a newer version of a similar, less capable AI system OpenAI rolled out last year) can also edit existing images by adding or taking out objects\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine such on-demand image generation eventually serving as a powerful tool for making all kinds of creative content, whether it be art or ads; DALL-E 2 and a similar such system, Midjourney, have already been used to help create magazine covers. OpenAI and Google have pointed to a few ways the technology might be commercialized, such as for editing images or creating stock images.\n\nNeither DALL-E 2 nor Imagen is currently available to the public. Yet they share an issue with many others that already are: they can also produce disturbing results that reflect the gender and cultural biases of the data on which they were trained — data that includes millions of images pulled from the internet.\n\nAn image created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe bias in these AI systems presents a serious issue, experts told CNN Business. The technology can perpetuate hurtful biases and stereotypes. They’re concerned that the open-ended nature of these systems — which makes them adept at generating all kinds of images from words — and their ability to automate image-making means they could automate bias on a massive scale. They also have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes, such as spreading disinformation.\n\n“Until those harms can be prevented, we’re not really talking about systems that can be used out in the open, in the real world,” said Arthur Holland Michel, a senior fellow at Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs who researches AI and surveillance technologies.\n\nDocumenting bias\n\nAI has become common in everyday life in the past few years but it’s only recently that the public has taken notice — both of how common it is, and how gender, racial, and other types of biases can creep into the technology. Facial-recognition systems in particular have been increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and racial bias.\n\nOpenAI and Google Research have acknowledged many of the issues and risks related to their AI systems in documentation and research, with both saying that the systems are prone to gender and racial bias and to depicting Western cultural stereotypes and gender stereotypes.\n\nOpenAI, whose mission is to build so-called artificial general intelligence that benefits all people, included in an online document titled “Risks and limitations” pictures illustrating how text prompts can bring up these issues: A prompt for “nurse”, for instance, resulted in images that all appeared to show stethoscope-wearing females, while one for “CEO” showed images that all appeared to be men and nearly all of them were white.\n\nLama Ahmad, policy research program manager at OpenAI, said researchers are still learning how to even measure bias in AI, and that OpenAI can use what it learns to tweak its AI over time. Ahmad led OpenAI’s efforts to work with a group of outside experts earlier this year to better understand issues within DALL-E 2 and offer feedback so it can be improved.\n\nGoogle declined a request for an interview from CNN Business. In its research paper introducing Imagen, the Google Brain team members behind it wrote that Imagen appears to encode “several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes.”\n\nThe contrast between the images these systems create and the thorny ethical issues is stark for Julie Carpenter, a research scientist and fellow in the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\n“One of the things we have to do is we have to understand AI is very cool and it can do some things very well. And we should work with it as a partner,” Carpenter said. “But it’s an imperfect thing. It has its limitations. We have to adjust our expectations. It’s not what we see in the movies.”\n\nAn image created by an AI system called DALL-E 2, built by OpenAI. OpenAI\n\nHolland Michel is also concerned that no amount of safeguards can prevent such systems from being used maliciously, noting that deepfakes — a cutting-edge application of AI to create videos that purport to show someone doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say — were initially harnessed to create faux pornography.\n\n“It kind of follows that a system that is orders of magnitude more powerful than those early systems could be orders of magnitude more dangerous,” he said.\n\nHint of bias\n\nBecause Imagen and DALL-E 2 take in words and spit out images, they had to be trained with both types of data: pairs of images and related text captions. Google Research and OpenAI filtered harmful images such as pornography from their datasets before training their AI models, but given the large size of their datasets such efforts are unlikely catch all such content, nor render the AI systems unable to produce harmful results. In its Imagen paper, Google researchers pointed out that, despite filtering some data, they also used a massive dataset that is known to include porn, racist slurs, and “harmful social stereotypes.”\n\nFiltering can also lead to other issues: Women tend to be represented more than men in sexual content, for instance, so filtering out sexual content also reduces the number of women in the dataset, said Ahmad.\n\nAnd truly filtering these datasets for bad content is impossible, Carpenter said, since people are involved in decisions about how to label and delete content — and different people have different cultural beliefs.\n\n“AI doesn’t understand that,” she said.\n\nSome researchers are thinking about how it might be possible to reduce bias in these types of AI systems, but still use them to create impressive images. One possibility is using less, rather than more, data.\n\nAlex Dimakis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said one method involves starting with a small amount of data — for example, a photo of a cat — and cropping it, rotating it, creating a mirror image of it, and so on, to effectively turn one picture into many different images. (A graduate student Dimakis advises was a contributor to the Imagen research, but Dimakis himself was not involved in the system’s development, he said.)\n\n“This solves some of the problems, but it doesn’t solve other problems,” Dimakis said. The trick on its own won’t make a dataset more diverse, but the smaller scale could let people working with it be more intentional about the images they’re including.\n\nRoyal raccoons\n\nFor now, OpenAI and Google Research are trying to keep the focus on cute pictures and away from images that may be disturbing or show humans.\n\nThere are no realistic-looking images of people in the vibrant sample images on either Imagen’s nor DALL-E 2’s online project page, and OpenAI says on its page that it used “advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures.” This safeguard could prevent users from getting image results for, say, a prompt that attempts to show a specific politician performing some kind of illicit activity.\n\nOpenAI has provided access to DALL-E 2 to thousands of people who signed up to a waitlist since April. Participants must agree to an extensive content policy, which tells users to not try to make, upload, or share pictures “that are not G-rated or that could cause harm.” DALL-E 2 also uses filters to prevent it from generating a picture if a prompt or image upload violates OpenAI’s policies, and users can flag problematic results. In late June, OpenAI started allowing users to post photorealistic human faces created with DALL-E 2 to social media, but only after adding some safety features, such as preventing users from generating images containing public figures.\n\n“Researchers, specifically, I think it’s really important to give them access,” Ahmad said. This is, in part, because OpenAI wants their help to study areas such as disinformation and bias.\n\nGoogle Research, meanwhile, is not currently letting researchers outside the company access Imagen. It has taken requests on social media for prompts that people would like to see Imagen interpret, but as Mohammad Norouzi, a co-author on the Imagen paper, tweeted in May, it won’t show images “including people, graphic content, and sensitive material.”\n\nStill, as Google Research noted in its Imagen paper, “Even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects.”\n\nA hint of this bias is evident in one of the images Google posted to its Imagen webpage, created from a prompt that reads: “A wall in a royal castle. There are two paintings on the wall. The one on the left a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon king. The one on the right a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon queen.”\n\nAn image of \"royal\" raccoons created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe image is just that, with paintings of two crowned raccoons — one wearing what looks like a yellow dress, the other in a blue-and-gold jacket — in ornate gold frames. But as Holland Michel noted, the raccoons are sporting Western-style royal outfits, even though the prompt didn’t specify anything about how they should appear beyond looking “royal.”\n\nEven such “subtle” manifestations of bias are dangerous, Holland Michel said.\n\n“In not being flagrant, they’re really hard to catch,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/tech/doordash-layoffs/index.html", "title": "DoorDash to lay off 1,250 corporate employees | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nDoorDash on Wednesday said it will lay off about 1,250 corporate employees after growing its team too quickly during the pandemic, making it the latest tech company to cut staff in recent weeks.\n\nThe cuts represent about 6% of DoorDash’s staff, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nDoorDash CEO Tony Xu shared the layoff news in a memo to staff early Wednesday, calling it “the most difficult change to DoorDash that I’ve had to announce in our almost 10-year history.”\n\n“If you are among those impacted, I am truly sorry and I apologize to have some of you wake up to this news as opposed to reading it during more normal hours,” Xu added.\n\nLike other tech companies, DoorDash experienced a pandemic boom as more consumers embraced online deliveries and shied away from stores and restaurants amid the health crisis.

The City manager came onto the field at halftime and remonstrated with Haaland as they walked toward the tunnel, even flicking away a camera that was following the pair.\n\n“We are still in the start phase of this marathon but I’m not stressing. I’m relaxed,” Haaland said. “I have to keep on developing and enjoy the chaos around me and perform on the pitch.”\n\nWORLD CUP CENTRAL: 2023 Women's World Cup Live Scores, Schedules, Standings, Bracket and More\n\nIt wasn't the perfect evening for City, which is bidding to become the first team in English soccer history to win four straight top-flight league titles.\n\nKevin De Bruyne, starting for the first time since coming off early in the Champions League final with a hamstring problem, lasted 23 minutes before needing to be substituted after pulling up.\n\nGuardiola said it was a recurrence of the same problem.\n\n“It's a pity — he has recovered well but now we have lost him for some time,” Guardiola said.\n\nAlso during the first half, City defender Rico Lewis was struck by a lighter thrown from the crowd as he lay on the ground near the corner flag after being fouled. Burnley said a fan had been removed from the stadium by police in an incident that further ruined its return to the Premier League after one season away.\n\nHaaland gave City the lead with his first touch in the game when he latched onto Rodri's nod-down from De Bruyne's right-wing cross and sidefooted a finish into the bottom corner.\n\nHis second goal was more spectacular and came after Julian Alvarez laid off a cross from Kyle Walker. With his back to goal, Haaland sent a first-time shot on the turn off the underside of the crossbar and into the top corner.\n\nHaaland was without a goal in his last six matches for City, including the loss to Arsenal in a penalty shootout in the Community Shield on Sunday.\n\n“I just have to keep on working, keep relaxing and not to focus on negative things,” Haaland said.\n\nRodri, who scored City's winner in the Champions League final against Inter Milan in June, smashed home the third goal from close range in the 75th minute after Burnley failed to clear a free kick into the area.\n\nBurnley ended the game with 10 men when Morocco winger Anass Zaroury was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Walker deep into second-half stoppage time.

The team had won the League Cup and the FA Cup, was going toe-to-toe with Manchester City in the English Premier League, and had reached the Champions League final.\n\nFor weeks there was talk of history as Jurgen Klopp’s men, famously called “mentality monsters” by the manager, were in contention for all four major trophies until the very end of the season.\n\nUltimately, two trophies went to Anfield instead of four, as Liverpool lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League and fell one point short in the league.\n\nBut there was little sign that, a few months on, things would unravel quite as they have for the Merseysiders.\n\nFor years, Liverpool has been the only team to challenge City for the league title – winning it in 2020 – yet this season Liverpool and City are worlds apart.\n\nA 2-1 defeat at home against Leeds on Saturday compounded a miserable start to the season for Liverpool, a team now in the bottom half of the table, 13 points adrift of City, and needing a surge to even finish in the top four to guarantee Champions League qualification next season.\n\nA title bid is effectively over before Halloween – unthinkable at the start of the season given Liverpool’s consistency since Klopp’s arrival at Anfield. It is fast becoming a season to forget for the Reds.\n\n“You can’t qualify for the Champions League if you play as inconsistently as we do at the moment,” Klopp told the BBC after the Leeds defeat, Liverpool’s third in the last five league games. “We have to fix that.\n\n“So many things are unlike us in this moment. I am sorry it is like this, but that is the situation. I am not sure how deep you can dig, but we will. It is like it is and we will work on solutions. We have to have a look at this game first, try to understand it a bit more and go from there.”\n\nMo Salah had leveled for Liverpool in the first half after Rodrigo had given visiting Leeds a fourth-minute lead. A late goal from Crysencio Summervile, however, in the 89th minute, secured a victory for Leeds which moves the team out of the relegation zone and ended Liverpool’s 29-game unbeaten run at home.\n\nCrysencio Summerville celebrates after scoring the winner. Nathan Stirk/Getty Images\n\n‘Liverpool being bullied’\n\nSo, why is Liverpool struggling so badly in the league this season? Its Champions League form has been fine, beating Ajax 3-0 in midweek to progress to the knockout stages, but in the Premier League defeats have come more frequently than victories.\n\nThere was the 1-0 league win over City which many thought might kickstart a sluggish start to the campaign, but that win – thanks to a wonderful Salah strike – now feels like a long time ago, rather than a couple of weeks.\n\nThe departure of Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich in the summer has undoubtedly had an impact – he was Klopp’s first major signing and became a key player for his goals, assists and relentless pressing.\n\nDarwin Nunez, who could become the club’s record signing, was bought to replace Mane and though he made an indifferent start to his Liverpool career – being sent off in his first home game – he has scored goals, but he is yet as integral to the team as Mane once was.\n\nThere are the injuries, of course. Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz – players who injected so much verve into the forward line as the team ruthlessly accumulated victories last season – are long-term absentees.\n\nLiverpool's Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez looks on after the final whistle. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNaby Keita, the club’s most dynamic midfielder, has yet to make a league appearance this season, while captain Jordan Henderson was injured against Ajax on Wednesday.\n\n“We had problems from the first day (of the season), injury wise. Players have had to play from the first day. It’s our situation and it means we have to help ourselves, and that is what we will do,” Klopp told reporters, according to Reuters.\n\n“Harvey (Elliott) has been exceptional for us this season. He had a good start but couldn’t keep it going. Thiago has been ill, up front the same (players) play all the time - they are the three strikers we have left.”\n\nKey players have been far from their best, too. Virgil van Dijk, one of the club’s greatest signings, has been guilty of uncharacteristic mistakes – and awful misses in front of goal, a missed header against Nottingham Forest last weekend, for example, in another costly defeat.\n\nThe Dutchman’s dip means the defense is more vulnerable than ever and it is not protected as it once was because Fabinho – usually another top performer – is also off-par in his defensive midfield role.\n\nWhere once there was a midfield of Fabinho, Henderson and the now departed Georginio Wijnaldum – a triumvirate which set the tempo for the high-octane football Klopp wants to play – now there is little of that energy and bite in the middle of the park.\n\nRodrigo Moreno shoots while under pressure from Liverpool's Joe Gomez. Nathan Stirk/Getty Images\n\nFormer Liverpool captain Graeme Souness was brutal in his assessment of his former team, saying on Sky Sports that Liverpool was being “bullied” in midfield.\n\n“You can say it was a lucky first goal, but that’s not the reason Liverpool lost the game, Liverpool were a country mile from where they were in the last few years: they don’t play with the same intensity. I think, in many instances tonight, Leeds were more than a match for what Liverpool had been doing to teams for years.\n\n“They basically bullied teams Liverpool, the midfield bullied teams. Now they’re being bullied in midfield, and that’s making them vulnerable at the back and they’re not creating the same chances up front. Liverpool are a shadow.”\n\nHe added: “When you look at the midfield of Thiago 31, Henderson 31, Fabinho 29 and after that you’ve got Keita 27, (Alex) Oxlade-Chamberlain, who’s been out injured, 29, Curtis Jones who’s 21 and Harvey Elliott who is 19.\n\n“If you go back to the start of the season, Jurgen must’ve looked at his midfield and felt ‘we’re vulnerable here’ because with the age group, the chances are they’ll get muscle injuries. After that, you’ve got the two young boys.\n\n“The Premier League is a really hard league to play in and is a long, difficult, sometimes physically and mentally, nine months for you. To expect two young lads to come in and take you through when senior players are injured is a big ask. Harvey Elliott has played in almost all the games.\n\n“I’ve said this since the start of the season, I felt the midfield is no longer the midfield that can get them into the position where they’re going to win the big trophies.”", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/football/trent-alexander-arnold-liverpool-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Trent Alexander-Arnold: The Premier League winner who still lives ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPremier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup – he’s won them all.\n\nAt 23 years of age, Trent Alexander-Arnold is already supremely successful.\n\nThe Liverpool and England defender has developed into one of Europe’s elite right-backs, displaying athleticism and playmaking abilities that are rare to find in his position.\n\nHowever, away from the pitch, Alexander-Arnold’s grounding has proved key for him remaining level-headed, despite being a vital cog in one of the best football teams in the world.\n\nWhile many in his position might be out spending their newfound wealth on cars, houses or entertainment, Alexander-Arnold’s focus is much closer to home.\n\nAlexander-Arnold during a friendly between Liverpool and Crystal Palace on July 15 in Singapore. Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images\n\nHe may be a local icon for Liverpool’s biggest team, but he still lives with his parents, doing the dishes and learning habits that help keep his life “clean and healthy.”\n\nStaying in a place where everything is stable has helped him reach the heights he has, Alexander-Arnold explains.\n\n“I always think young players rush things,” he told CNN Senior Sport Analyst Darren Lewis. “You start getting paid some money and young players always think the first thing is to move out, get a new car, stuff like that.\n\n“And then the environment is just not the same. You’re living at home. You’ve got your parents to keep you in line and make sure things are clean and tidy, the dishes aren’t stacking up and you’re going home to a nice, clean environment and things like that.\n\n“Whereas living at home (on your own), breakfast and dinner, you just think: ‘I’ll do that later.’ And then you come in from training and then you’re just not in a clean, nice environment. So I’ve never felt a rush to leave home. I’ve always had the right messages.\n\n“I’ve just always enjoyed having family around me. And they’ve kept my feet on the ground and pushed me to the levels that I’ve got so far. So I don’t think there’s any rush for me to make a decision.”\n\nAlexander-Arnold signing autographs at the end of the open training session on July 11 in Bangkok, Thailand. Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images\n\nFans\n\nEver since he can remember, Alexander-Arnold has been a Liverpool fan.\n\nFrom living just five minutes away from the team’s training ground – he remembers asking his mom to take him and his siblings to catch a glimpse of their “idols” through the cracks in the walls on their days off from school – to watching them at the weekends, he was in love with the club from a young age.\n\nIn celebration of Liverpool’s dramatic Champions League win in 2005, Alexander-Arnold was one of thousands who took to the city’s streets to welcome home their heroes in the open-top bus parade.\n\nAlthough he was a massive fan, his own introduction at the club was one of pure luck. “It was like a half-term camp and the invite got sent to my school and it was like: ‘So who wants to go?’” he said.\n\nAlexander-Arnold has a shot on goal during the Liverpool vs. Newcastle United U18 Premier League game on September 26, 2015. Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty Images\n\n“And as you can imagine, everyone in the classroom put their hand up. We have to pick names out of a hat, and luckily my name got picked out. I went along to it with a few classmates and after – I don’t know how long it was – I think maybe 10, 15 minutes, a scout went up to my mom and said: ‘We want you to start bringing him up here if you can?’”\n\nAnd as he explains: “The rest is history.”\n\nSince making his first-team debut in 2016, Alexander-Arnold has blossomed into one of the most dynamic fullbacks in the world, terrorizing defenses from a deep position with his precise crosses and accurate through-balls.\n\nHis transformation into the new prototype of right-back – attacking, physical and good on the ball – was a key reason behind Liverpool’s Premier League victory in 2020, the club’s first for 30 years.\n\nJordan Henderson lifts the Premier League trophy aloft alongside Mohamed Salah as they celebrate winning the league. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nIn his 161 appearances in the Premier League, he’s scored 10 goals, provided 45 assists and has a remarkable record of winning 114 games and only losing 19 times.\n\nBut despite that record, such has been the brilliance of Manchester City under Pep Guardiola, Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool’s trophy winning has been stymied.\n\nYes, they’ve won plenty during his time in the first team, but the Reds have been narrowly pipped to the Premier League title four times in the last five years – twice by just one point.\n\nThe nip-and-tuck battle between the two English juggernauts has become must-watch TV over the course of a season, with Alexander-Arnold admitting playing Man City is Liverpool’s “biggest game of the season,” despite traditionally having more intense rivalries with Everton and Manchester United.\n\n“I think, historically, there’s always going to be that tension and the rivalries with Everton and with United. But I think right now, it’s for different reasons. I think there’s always going to be a dislike with Liverpool and Everton and Man United,” he said.\n\n“It’s always going to be that no matter where either team finishes in the league, whenever it’s going on, there are always very heated games and both fans really want to win it the most. But I think for different reasons, now, Man City is the biggest game of season, the best team in England, one of, if not the, best team in the world as well.\n\n“And, of course, they’re the team that set the pace, set the benchmark for the rest of the league. Four leagues in five years is something that not many teams can say we’ve done. So it’s difficult for us to look past them and look for anywhere else as motivation. Our motivation is if we stay in and around City, then over the last four or five years, you’re in a good place.”\n\nSeason finale\n\nAlthough last year was another successful season for Liverpool and Alexander-Arnold personally – with both FA Cup and League Cup winners medals added to the trophy cabinet – it ended on a sour note.\n\nIn the season finale – the Champions League final in Paris which Liverpool lost 1-0 – chaos involving Liverpool fans outside the stadium marred the occasion.\n\nThe game was delayed by 35 minutes as Liverpool fans struggled to get into the Stade de France, with the French police using tear gas on fans held in tightly packed areas.\n\nAfter the match, despite the club’s account of events and details from the fans, Reds fans were blamed in part for the disruption, with French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin saying “that the disturbances caused were related to a massive influx of spectators and an extensive number of false tickets.”\n\nHowever, a report from the French Senate cleared Liverpool fans of any responsibility in July, instead blaming decision-making from French officials.\n\nSenator Laurent Lafon, president of the Culture, Education and Communication Commission, which co-authored the report, blamed the violent scenes at the final on “a series of malfunctions that occurred in a rather vague administrative and decision-making framework.”\n\nPolice and stewards are seen as Liverpool fans queue outside the stadium prior to the UEFA Champions League final match between Liverpool and Real Madrid at Stade de France on May 28 in Paris. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nAnd for Alexander-Arnold and the rest of his teammates, he admits the whole situation was “strange.”\n\n“The messages that were broadcast through the stadium was late fan arrivals and stuff like that … and you believe what you hear and see in those situations,” he said.\n\n“Then it wasn’t until after the game, obviously, we actually found out the truth and what happened, what went on. But I think the way the fans have dealt with it – when it happened, during the game and after the game and the following months afterwards – has been outstanding.\n\n“It’s something us as players and as a club, we’re really proud of, the way they’ve made sure the truth has come out. They’ve made sure that the fans are not just getting blamed for stuff that they’ve done.”", "authors": ["Darren Lewis Ben Morse", "Darren Lewis", "Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2023/06/03/man-city-beats-man-united-2-1-in-fa-cup-final-to-complete-second-leg-of-treble-bid/70284692007/", "title": "Man City beats Man United in FA Cup final to keep treble bid alive", "text": "Steve Douglas\n\nAP\n\nLONDON — Manchester City’s mission to win a treble of major trophies stayed on track after beating Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup final on Saturday, with the first of Ilkay Gundogan’s two goals coming after a record 13 seconds.\n\nWith City having already retained the Premier League, now only a first-ever Champions League title stands between Pep Guardiola's team and immortality in English soccer.\n\nGundogan, City’s captain, scored the quickest goal in an FA Cup final – timed by British broadcaster BBC at 12.91 seconds – only for United midfielder Bruno Fernandes to convert a 33rd-minute penalty against the run of play after Jack Grealish was adjudged to have handled the ball.\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up to get the latest news and features sent to your inbox\n\nMAN UNITED ICON SACKED: Struggling Inter Miami dismisses Phil Neville\n\nWORLD CUP CENTRAL: 2023 Women's World Cup Live Scores, Schedules, Standings, Bracket and More\n\nIf Gundogan’s opener was probably his best goal for City, his 51st-minute winning goal might be one of his scrappiest as he met a cross from Kevin De Bruyne from a free kick with a left-foot volley that bobbled between two United defenders and past goalkeeper David De Gea.\n\nUnited was looking to protect its proud status as the only team to win the league-FA Cup-European Cup treble, in 1999, but needs a favor from Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Istanbul on June 10.\n\nIt was the 142nd FA Cup final and the first between the two Manchester clubs, with Prince William and United great David Beckham among those in attendance at England’s national stadium.\n\nCity’s class of 2023 became the 13th team in English soccer history to clinch a league-and-cup double while the Abu Dhabi-controlled team won a 16th trophy since 2011, when City ended its 35-year title drought by winning the FA Cup.\n\nIt was the 13th trophy in Guardiola’s seven years at the club and the 34th of his managerial career.\n\nThe latest haul of trophies comes in the same season that the club was charged by the Premier League with more than 100 breaches of financial rules.

Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

Addison, Bennington and Rutland counties each had one new case.\n\nStatewide, about 917 people have recovered from the virus and 54,745 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized for the disease, the department said; nine people are hospitalized and under investigation as possible cases.\n\n________\n\nU.S. and state flags will be lowered to half-staff on Friday at all state facilities as part of a monthly observance of Vermonters who have died due to COVID-19, Governor Phil Scott announced.\n\nVermont's first fatality from the new coronavirus took place March 19, 2020. A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

When Hu then reaches for the documents, Li pulls them away.\n\nXi, who is sat on Hu’s other side, glances at the exchanges and summons a senior aide to whom he speaks briefly. Moments later, a second aide hurries over, receives an instruction from Xi, then speaks to an apparently nonplussed Hu.\n\nAs per the footage that circulated on Saturday, Hu – who appears reluctant to leave – is then lifted from his chair, taken by the arm and escorted out.\n\nChina's former leader Hu Jintao is lifted from his chair by a young aide at the closing of the Communist Party Congress on Saturday. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nNone of the footage – either that released on Saturday or Tuesday – has been broadcast in China. Neither has the incident been reported in Chinese language media, or discussed on Chinese social media, where conversations around senior leaders are highly restricted.\n\nLate on Saturday night, China’s official Xinhua news agency tweeted in English that Hu “insisted on attending” the closing ceremony despite his poor health and was escorted out after feeling unwell. However, within China, where Twitter is blocked, the incident was not mentioned.\n\nOn Weibo, censors even restricted the search results for vague keywords such as “escorted away” or “leaving the meeting,” in an apparent effort to prevent users from making veiled references to the incident, according to Eric Liu, a censorship analyst with China Digital Times.\n\nTuesday’s footage has fueled fervent speculation about what was in the document and why Hu was not allowed to see it – and left observers divided over what sparked his exit.\n\nSome maintain it was likely due to Hu’s poor health or mental state – after retiring in 2013, he has been seen in public looking increasingly frail. Others suggest it could be a deliberate power play by Xi to show his unrivaled authority.\n\nFormer Chinese leader Hu Jintao is taken by the arm and escorted out. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nSymbol of a new era\n\nLike many unexplained episodes in the black box of elite Chinese politics, the true reason behind Hu’s unexpected departure may never be known. But experts say the symbolism – unintended or otherwise – is hard to miss: Having eradicated any vestige of influence from party elders or rival factions, Xi has ushered in a new era of one-man rule surrounded by only staunch loyalists.\n\nMeanwhile, gone with Hu are the many hallmarks that had defined his decade in power during which he presided over a period of double-digit economic growth and comparative openness.\n\nHu also relinquished both his party and military posts when he retired in 2012 after two terms in power – earning him praise from Xi for “his broad mind and noble character.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Xi's broken almost all norms: CNN Beijing Bureau Chief reacts to China's new leadership 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile Hu was never as powerful as Xi is now – owing in part to the model of collective leadership and the balancing influence of multiple party factions and elders, including his predecessor Jiang Zemin – he was associated with a faction connected to the Communist Youth League, a once powerful grouping whose influence has diminished considerably during Xi’s rule.\n\nSteve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said the latest footage suggests Hu’s dramatic exit was likely not planned.\n\n“For whatever reasons, Xi ordered Hu to be escorted out when he must have thought that Hu might not behave exactly as Xi would have wanted,” he said.\n\nThe new video has been interpreted by some as a sign of Hu’s supposed displeasure with the outcome of the Congress, which saw Xi consolidate his power by stacking the new leadership team with his loyal allies and proteges.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang and Wang Yang, head of China’s top advisory body, both retired from the party’s supreme Politburo Standing Committee, despite being one year below the unofficial retirement age of 68. Both Li and Wang are seen as closer to Hu’s sphere of influence.\n\nIn an even more surprising revelation on Sunday, Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, another protege of the elder Hu (the two are not related), was dropped from the new 24-member Politburo. Once seen as a rising star being groomed for the top leadership, Hu Chunhua’s political future has dimmed under Xi.\n\nBut Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, said a planned public purge at the closing of the congress was unlikely, given the party’s emphasis on unity.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's leader is set for a third term. One expert weighs in on what to expect 09:27 - Source: CNN\n\n“The Chinese Communist Party prizes the image of unity and control, and more so than ever during the Xi era,” said Sung.\n\nIf Xi had wanted to purge Hu to prevent the former leader from raising objections in public, he would have done so before foreign press were allowed into the auditorium, Sung said.\n\n“A high-profile purge of Hu at a critical juncture like the 20th Party Congress shows the presence of dissent, and the notion that Xi is at least ‘challengeable,’” he said. “Neither is great for Xi’s image of invincibility.”\n\n‘No empathy’\n\nMany observers were also struck by the apparent coldness of the other leaders on the stage. Few showed any concern for Hu, and many avoided looking in his direction.\n\n“There’s no empathy,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nTo rise through the party, officials have learned to hide their personal emotions and characteristics, Wu said, “They just try to be like a machine in the party machinery.”\n\nOn his way out, Hu patted the shoulder of his protege, Premier Li, who nodded and turned briefly to watch him walk away. Next to Li, Wang sat upright and stared straight ahead, seemingly frozen in motion.\n\nFormer Chinese leader Hu Jintao pats the shoulder of his protege, Premier Li Keqiang. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFurther down the edge of the stage, Hu Chunhua did not even cast a glance toward the party elder as he passed by. Instead, he looked straight ahead with a notable frown and arms folded across his chest.\n\nBut even if the real reason for the elder Hu’s departure never becomes clear, the incident has nevertheless sent an unequivocal message about Xi’s absolute hold on power, analysts say.\n\nHu’s undignified exit showed that “Xi had reduced the once powerful (Communist) Youth League faction to insignificance,” said Tsang at the University of London.\n\n“With no successor in sight, and the previous leader humiliated, Xi had projected to the party that…no one in the party should look over his shoulder for another leader, be him the future or the past leader,” Tsang said.\n\n“Now there is only one leader in China.”", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/politics/president-biden-winning-streak/index.html", "title": "The same Joe Biden suddenly looks different | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nJoe Biden is no more or less capable a president than he was two months ago. His staff is no more or less competent.\n\nBut suddenly, images of Biden as a feeble septuagenarian atop a mismanaged White House have given way to those of an experienced leader, smiling behind aviator sunglasses, whose battle-tested team has delivered on a range of national priorities. A winning streak does that for you.\n\nIt has not happened because of a strategy shift or staff shakeup, though at low points allies wanted him to take those ritual steps. It’s been a combination of good luck, skill and persistence by a president and Democratic Party determined to act unilaterally where Republicans wouldn’t and strike compromises where Republicans would.\n\nGas prices, which wounded Biden when they spiked, have declined for two months. The President didn’t cause either movement. But the turn of fortune has relieved some of the inflation pressures that remain his single largest political problem.\n\nLate last month, weather conditions cleared the way for a CIA drone to kill al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri on the balcony of his Kabul home. The precision strike, the planning of which began this past spring, vindicated Biden’s assertions that the US could fight terrorism in Afghanistan even without troops on the ground.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Justice has been delivered': Biden says US killed al Qaeda leader 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nIn Congress, Biden has proven detractors wrong from both directions. Politicians and pundits describing a failed legislative agenda had written their reviews before the end of the play.\n\nProgressive lawmakers who scorned the former senator’s talk of working with the GOP have seen Congress make bipartisan investments in infrastructure, domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, and veterans’ health care. They joined a critical mass of Republicans to pass them.\n\nOthers who complained Biden had veered too far left have seen Congress take the largest-ever government steps to curb climate change. Not a single Republican voted yes. Every single Democrat did.\n\nThis doesn’t make Biden a modern-day FDR or LBJ. He cannot claim a singular monument to rival Social Security, Medicare or even the Affordable Care Act, though he has strengthened it.\n\nProposed investments to expand economic opportunity through child care, child tax credits, paid leave and universal pre-kindergarten have faltered. The bipartisan gun-safety law that ended years of congressional paralysis did not meet his call to ban assault weapons. He has not won legislation to safeguard voting rights at a moment when Republican extremism threatens democracy and the rule of law.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Historian who warned Biden in private White House meeting speaks out 05:37 - Source: CNN\n\nPartisan math has imposed the fundamental constraint. To act alone on the small number of top-priority initiatives shielded from Republican filibuster, Democrats can sustain only a few defections in the House and none in the Senate. The climate package prevailed only because Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, after months of resistance, finally agreed to join hands with party colleagues.\n\nThat legislative tightrope makes all the more remarkable what Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have achieved. To call them “wins” on the political scoreboard, as if governance were a sporting event, obscures their impact on American life.\n\nThe 2021 infrastructure law, which eluded Biden’s two immediate predecessors, means $550 billion for new federal investments in roads, bridges, airports, public transit, railroads, rural broadband, clean water and electric-vehicle charging stations, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor bill provides over $52 billion to spur domestic manufacturing of vital components for products ranging from cars to computers, reducing America’s reliance on foreign suppliers.\n\nThe so-called “burn pits” bill extends new health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans exposed to toxins during their service.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act – named to lure Manchin though it will have negligible impact on inflation this year – means Medicare beneficiaries will pay no more than $35 per month for insulin and no more than $2,000 per year in out-of-pocket drug costs. For the first time, Medicare can use its market power to negotiate lower prices from drug companies.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect you 02:05 - Source: CNN Business\n\nThe IRA also devotes $370 billion to developing clean energy and curbing climate change, which analysts say will help the US reduce carbon emissions 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. It sustains American leadership at a time when extreme weather events increasingly place the dangers to the world in sharp relief.\n\nBiden’s weak public standing has begun ticking slightly up. Democrats on the 2022 ballot have gained more ground from anger over the conservative Supreme Court’s decision to end the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean voters will reward them in midterm elections this fall. Republicans need just a four-seat net gain – well below the historical average for the party not holding the White House – to recapture control of the House.\n\nNor does it mean Biden will follow the precedents of Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in recovering from early setbacks to win a second term. At age 79, Biden looks the part of the oldest chief executive in American history as restless younger Democrats eye fresh leadership.\n\nBut it does mean the President and his party have capitalized on the opportunity control of government has given them for these two years.

Reiser just wanted to make people laugh.\n\n“To me, the most fun thing to do by far is stand-up,” he says, calling from his home in Los Angeles. “Because it’s immediate and you get your response. You don’t have to wait eight months to see if anybody liked it.”\n\nSo that’s what he’s been doing for the last five years or so, traveling the country to perform stand-up comedy between TV and movie projects. He’ll do it again Friday at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall in south Fort Myers.\n\nReiser says it's a relief to step onstage, alone, and just do the jokes. There aren’t any producers or directors or anybody else telling him what to do.\n\n“Stand-up is devoid of any of that,” Reiser says. “You don’t have to raise money. You don’t have to get approval. You don’t have seven people pitching in and saying, ‘I think you should make this joke a different joke.’\n\n“It’s just you. You just do it and you go home. It’s so uncomplicated. I love that about it.”\n\nReiser won’t be doing jokes about his famous TV shows and movies — although he does plan to take questions from the audience after Friday’s show. And he won’t be doing bits about politics, current events or anything edgy.\n\nInstead, Reiser says he’ll give “Mad About You” fans exactly what’d they’d expect — lots of comedy about love, relationships and what he calls “married guy stuff.”\n\nMore: Top live shows to see in SWFL, including Shinedown, Patti LaBelle, Funk Fest\n\nMore: Gorilla-masked activists Guerrilla Girls show feminist work at FSW\n\nIt make sense: Reiser was doing stand-up comedy long before he co-created the 90s TV hit “Mad About You.”\n\n“‘Mad About You’ grew out of my stand-up,” he says. “At the time, I was newly married and that was the material I was doing. So that was the natural kick-off for me.\n\n\"And I always tell people — and I’ve said it before — I’m not smart enough to make anything up. So I just have to tell people what happened. So ‘Mad About You’ was a lot of what happened to me, and all the writers would say, ‘Well here’s the conversation I had with my wife or my husband.’ And that became the soup of the show.”\n\nReiser doesn’t know how it happened, but somehow he ended up taking a long break from his first love, stand-up comedy, to focus on his TV and movie career. More than two decades, in fact.\n\nBut then, about five years ago, he started working up a stand-up act and performing it.\n\n“My intention was always to get back to it,” he says. “There are some comedians who become comics to get noticed and get their own TV show and then never do it again. To me, it was the opposite. I only wanted to do stand-up. I didn’t really have any burning desire to be an actor.\"\n\nThen he started getting high-profile acting gigs. And suddenly he became a TV and movie star, despite himself.\n\n“Those things sort of laid out, and you go with what comes your way,\" he says. \"But I always wanted to get back to it (stand-up).\n\n\"The minute I did, it was instantly like an old pair of shoes that fit great: ‘Oh man, I forgot! I love these shoes [laughs]!’”\n\nReiser doesn’t promise that he’ll make everyone laugh at Mann Hall. But that’s OK: His show comes with a tongue-in-cheek guarantee.\n\n“I always tell people this,” he says. “If you come to my show, and you’re not fully satisfied, I will come by next year and I will take you to see someone FUNNIER. So I feel that everybody wins.”\n\nHere’s what else Reiser had to say about:\n\nHow he got cast in the hit Netflix TV show “Stranger Things.”\n\n“I got a call that they wanted to meet me,” Reiser says about the show’s co-creators and showrunners, brothers Ross and Matt Duffer. “And when we met, they said, ‘We wrote this thinking of you. … It was actually written as Dr. Reiser.’\n\n“I’m tickled! These guys are 31 or something. I said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if you’d never heard of me. Why do you even know me?’ I would assume it was from ‘Aliens’ because of the vibe of the show. And they said, ‘Well, yes, but our actual introduction was ‘Diner.’ Our father brought us up watching ‘Diner.’ And I said, ‘Well, I salute your father!’”\n\nHis career longevity, stretching from “Diner” in 1982 to “Mad About You” in the 90s to recent hits such as “Whiplash” and “Stranger Things.”\n\n“I’m like morning fog,” he says and laughs. “I’m morning fog. I’m always there -- but then slowly I go away.”\n\nHow couples related to “Mad About You” and often said it felt like he and co-star Helen Hunt were telling stories from their own lives.\n\n“That was the common response from people about ‘Mad About You,’” he says. “People who liked the show would say, ‘Boy, you guys must have microphones in our house. ‘Cause that was EXACTLY the fight that we had.’”\n\nIf you go\n\nWho: Paul Reiser\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday\n\nWhere: Barbara B Mann Performing Arts Hall, 13350 FSW Parkway, south Fort Myers\n\nTickets: $24-$48 (plus applicable taxes and fees, prices subject to change)\n\nInfo: 481-4849 or bbmannpah.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/health/covid-antibody-response-vaccines/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 vaccine study links side effects with greater antibody ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPeople who reported experiencing side effects to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines such as fever, chills or muscle pain tended to have a greater antibody response following vaccination, according to new research.\n\nHaving such symptoms after vaccination is associated with greater antibody responses compared with having only pain or rash at the injection site or no symptoms at all, suggests the paper published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open.\n\n“In conclusion, these findings support reframing postvaccination symptoms as signals of vaccine effectiveness and reinforce guidelines for vaccine boosters in older adults,” the researchers – from Columbia University in New York, University of Vermont and Boston University – wrote in their paper.\n\nBut even though some people may have small, localized side effects or no symptoms at all, the vaccine still elicits robust immune responses in them too.

Unless you maybe stub your toe on the gumball machine.\"\n\nWith the old-fashioned charm of a general store and the glamour of Hollywood owners, Samuel’s Sweet Shop has emerged as a destination for devotees of candy and caffeine alike, drawing fans from near and far.\n\nSamuel’s nearly closed its doors when original owner Ira Gutner died in 2014. But, nearly five years after it was saved by a cadre of celebrities who were avid customers, the shop is preparing to celebrate its 25th anniversary on April 30.\n\nBeyond finding its sweet spot in the business, the team at Samuel’s is looking to a future that may include expansion.\n\nWhile providing customers the comfort of a cup of coffee or nostalgic candies like Tootsie Rolls, Mary Janes and Charleston Chews, Samuel's also offers a dose of the unexpected. You might just bump into someone like comedian Amy Schumer on the sidewalk outside.\n\n\"I'm a Samuel's customer,\" said Schumer, who is not among the store's famous owners, on a recent visit. \"You feel like you're walking into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.\"\n\nBut while Hollywood magic contributed to Samuel's success, its owners' involvement has been anything but fictional.\n\nMixing magic with reality\n\nThe floors inside Samuel’s were installed with the help of actress, local resident and co-owner Hilarie Burton of television’s “One Tree Hill.” Burton's husband, actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan of \"The Walking Dead\" — yes, he's a co-owner as well — has hauled equipment.\n\nMorgan, before he was an owner, was a loyal devotee of the store's coffee, which can be enjoyed quietly from a corner window seat. That's where you can find resident Ken Aldous in most mornings — Iif he can commandeer the spot before it is secured by others.\n\n“There are are a number of regulars here, we sort of compete for this chair,” he said with a laugh. “This is regarded as the best chair in Rhinebeck.”\n\nAsked about the celebrity owners, Aldous said, “I guess I’ve met a couple of them here from time to time. But I never really thought, ‘Oh wow, this is amazing, celebrities.’ … I’ve only seen them be part of the woodwork here, which is nice.”\n\nStarting April 26, millions of people will converge on theaters around the world to see Rudd portray superhero Ant-Man in “Avengers: Endgame.”\n\nBut the actor known from movies like “Anchorman” and “The 40 Year Old Virgin” takes as much pride in his less glamorous, though no less important, role at Samuel's. And, yes, he occasionally mans the register.\n\n“One of the most important things any human can experience is to be a part of a community and feel connected to where you live and to other people who live there, especially in a job like mine,” Rudd told the Poughkeepsie Journal.\n\nHe continued, “I’m in lots of different locations meeting lots of different people. At times, you can feel you’re untethered a little bit. So to have this place, to come in and just serve coffee for a while and hang out at the store and hand out candies … to feel a part of the community makes us sane. It makes us feel part of something important.”\n\nAny local business celebrating a silver anniversary deserves a round of applause. But Samuel’s sweetness hits the heart — and strikes the tastes buds — a bit harder as it approaches its 25th anniversary because this business faced an uncertain future and possible closure when Gutner died.\n\nA partnership emerges\n\nRudd and his wife, Julie, Morgan and Burton, and part-time Dutchess resident Andy Ostroy and his girlfriend, actress Phoebe Jonas, were at the time customers who had become friends with Gutner and manager John Traver. And during Gutner’s calling hours, Burton approached Traver.\n\n“She came over to me and she said ‘Whatever you do, don’t close the store, keep it open. We’re going to help you,’” Traver recalled. “I still get the chills talking about it.”\n\nGutner's estate operated the store following his death. And the months passed.\n\n“They told me they’d help and they would check in periodically to see how I was doing and they told me they were working on it,” Traver said. “But a lot of time passed between April and December and there were a lot of sleepless night where it was like, ‘What’s going to happen? Are they going to help me? Is this place going to close? Should I just try to bootstrap this thing? Should I look for other help?' You know, running the tape over and over again.”\n\nJulie Rudd would pop in and tell Traver to hang in there. In the tent Samuel’s operated at the Dutchess County Fair that August, the Rudds, Morgan, Burton, Ostroy and Jonas walked in and assured Traver that everything would be OK.\n\nBut, he said, “It hadn’t happened yet so you’re still kind of operating nervously — sales tax, rent, electric, phone, pay everybody.”\n\nIn December 2014, the new partnership — which now included Traver — purchased Samuel’s.\n\n“It was incredible,” Traver said. “It was such a beautiful marriage of a person who knew how to operate the store, who has a long-time connection to the community, and these special people who are passionate about this, taking an interest.”\n\nJulie Rudd, who co-created the store’s logo with graphic artist Cricket Lengyel, said everyone was determined to keep Samuel's open.\n\n“When Ira passed away, like everyone else in town, we thought, 'What’s going to happen to Samuel’s?' ” she said. “We don’t want to lose Samuel’s. When the idea came that maybe we should try to save it and keep it going, it wasn’t so much about the candy, it was about, 'This is a meeting place in the community and a place that brings joy to the community and kids love to come and we just really want to keep that going.' ”\n\nAnd, of course, there is that whole owning-a-candy-store aspect to owning a candy store.\n\n“The added bonus that we all found out is, oh, it’s really fun to own a candy store,” she said.\n\nRelishing a milestone\n\nTraver, 33, has worked at Samuel’s since he was 15.\n\nThe store’s silver anniversary, the momentum it now has and the simple joy of managing and co-owning a candy store is all resonating loudly for Traver, who was fearing the worst and preparing to look for a new job when Gutner died 26 days shy of the shop’s 20th anniversary.\n\n“At the 10-year anniversary I was in high school, it was neat,” said Traver, who lives in Rhinebeck with his wife Allyson and is gearing up for the birth of the couple’s first child in the fall. “ At the 20 year annivesary, it was a little scary and unsettling — and conforming when people would check in to see that you’re OK.”\n\nNow, Traver said, regarding the upcoming 25th anniversary, “This is the first time I’m really excited to celebrate this, this business.”\n\nIf you go\n\nSamuel’s Sweet Shop is at 42 E. Market St., Rhinebeck. Call 845-876-5312 or visit www.samuelssweetshop.com for information.\n\nSo, who was Samuel?\n\nSamuel was the late Ira Gutner’s uncle.\n\nAs a kid, Gutner, his father and his uncle Sam attended New York Giants games at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. As part of the game day ritual, Traver said, the trio would go to Pot Roast Sadie’s, which was part deli and part penny candy store. That experience, Traver said, instilled in Gutner a love of candy shops.\n\nAs an adult, Gutner worked in the garment industry in New York City. He discovered Rhinebeck in 1993 and found a vacuum where he was hoping to find a candy store. That prompted him to open Samuel’s and name it after his uncle.\n\nPaul Rudd talks candy\n\n“One of my very favorite candies is these Sour Patch Santas we get,” he said. “That’s been a game-changer for me. (Manager and co-owner) John (Traver) has even been able to secure some in June, so I have Christmas in June. Not everyone can get these sour Santas in the summer. This might be the best thing about being an owner of a candy shop.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/us/andrew-tate-manosphere-misogyny-solutions-cec/index.html", "title": "Misogynistic influencers are trending right now. Defusing their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAndrew Tate, the professional fighter-turned media personality who earned the ire and admiration of millions with his viral rants about male dominance, female submission and wealth, is everywhere these days.\n\nIt doesn’t matter that the so-called “alpha-male” podcaster, who openly advocates violence against women, has been banned from every major social media platform, or that he was kicked off the TV show “Big Brother” for violent and hateful behavior and had his house raided as part of an ongoing human trafficking investigation (he told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson he was the victim of a swatting attempt).\n\nHis ideas have already taken root in the minds of countless young men who see him as a role model of masculinity. Before it was taken down, his TikTok account racked up about 11.6 billion views. Social media spaces dedicated to teaching have featured accounts of students as young as middle schoolers parroting his diatribes and harassing female classmates. Rashes of sexual harassment in schools in the UK and Australia have also been blamed on Tate’s influence.\n\nHe’s not the only one, either. So-called male supremacist views have surged on TikTok and podcasting platforms, with personalities ranting about the rights of “high value” or “hypermasculine” men – those that they define as wealthy, confident, influential, sexually dominant and entitled to subservience from women.\n\nIf left unchecked, human rights groups and policy experts can point to what typically comes next. There is a clear pipeline between misogynist content and larger channels of hate, documented by the Anti-Defamation League and similar groups. Such philosophies have also inspired a rising rate of deadly violence.\n\nCombating this dangerous phenomenon requires muscle on multiple fronts. In the US and across the world, organizations are turning to technology and teaching methods to show young men and boys a better path. They’re also applying a more unexpected ingredient: Compassion.\n\nStopping hate before it starts\n\nBrette Steele speaks to community leaders and law enforcement in 2017. Mark Rightmire/Digital First Media/Orange County Register/Getty Images\n\nThe jumble of groups and philosophies that center around ideas of toxic masculinity is commonly referred to as the “manosphere.” Within lie incels (involuntary celibates), men’s rights activists, pick-up artists, and the content creators that spread these ideas to the masses. Brette Steele, senior director for Preventing Targeted Violence at the McCain Institute, says men usually flock to the manosphere because they are unhappy in some way and searching for a sense of belonging, and younger audiences are drawn in by a similar need.\n\n“Youth are searching for that sense of belonging, that kind of grounding to explain what’s happening to them,” she tells CNN.\n\n“In the last few years, more youth have had to turn to communities online. We’ve seen a degradation of in-person social skills, and in middle school, that’s when those social skills are first coming into play.”\n\nSteele works with several teams that are exploring ways to curb misogynist content and prevent the violence and extremism that sometimes follows. One of her teams out of Arizona State University created curricula and lesson plans for fourth- and fifth-graders that help build social resilience at a critical age.\n\n“We have to ask things like, when do youth actually develop the skill sets that can prevent some of these risk factors? When do they develop a positive sense of self-concept? When do they develop the ability to withstand rejection?”\n\nOnce young men have made contact with dangerous parts of the manosphere, Steele says redirection becomes a main strategy.\n\nDiverting Hate, a project out of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, Equity and Justice, maintains a database of terms used in the manosphere. By programming against those words, they can target ads toward people engaging in dangerous conversations in online public spaces.\n\n“The idea is to redirect people to more pro-social men’s organizations, and more positive representations of what masculinity could look like that are not violent or demeaning,” Steele says.\n\nChanging expectations\n\nTed Bunch at the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women 2018 Gala in New York City. Brian Ach/Getty Images\n\nTed Bunch, the co-founder of A Call to Men, says one of the keys to pulling men and boys out of the dangerous pipeline of misogyny is to understand where it starts. A Call to Men partners with schools, companies and professional sports organizations to promote what it calls “healthy masculinity:” concepts like kindness, respect for others, and an understanding that, in a patriarchal society, men have an opportunity to use their power to protect.\n\n“(Misogyny) teaches men that aggression, violence, and the domination of others is somehow embedded in their DNA,” Bunch says. “It’s not. It is the way men are socialized. In a male-dominated patriarchal society, all are taught that women and girls have less value, or that on some level they are the property.”\n\nOne of the first priorities of A Call to Men is always to mitigate the harm such thinking causes others, Bunch says. But seeing misogyny as a learned experience also presents an opportunity for compassion. Bunch stresses that ACTM and similar organizations for men don’t take the stance that masculinity is inherently toxic, or that manhood should be punished. Rather, his organization strives to give men opportunities to think differently about what, exactly, being a man means.\n\nBunch says some of the ACTM’s most effective work comes when it gets a group of men in a space of trust, and just lets them talk to each other – about things that make them sad, things that stress them out, and things they have been socialized to feel they shouldn’t address.\n\n“When we’re in rooms with men, and we start unpacking how we’ve been socialized, they are thirsty for this information,” he says.\n\nHe also notes that this process is especially effective when the group works with men in areas that are male-dominated and emblematic of values that can be considered very masculine, like law enforcement and the military.\n\n“We also point out that healthy manhood is an inward thing as well as an outward thing,” Bunch says. “Men have higher rates of suicide and early death. They struggle silently with anxiety and depression. They sometimes forgo basic medical care. Looking tough, being tough – those kinds of expectations harm men as well.”\n\nCalling out, and calling in\n\nWhen someone leverages misogyny to harm others, or begins to tread deeper into the manosphere, the first attempt to right the ship can be critical. Steele and Bunch say they have a general idea of what approaches do and do not work.\n\n“There is a real negativity for any type of mental health intervention in these (manosphere) spaces,” Steele says\n\nInstead, the work she supports focuses on diverting the pipeline, rather than pushing back against it.\n\n“There is a difference between a counter-narrative and an alternative narrative. Rather than pushing against the tide, such efforts are promoting other organizations that might provide the same sense of belonging or connection without the same negativity.”\n\nOn Youtube and TikTok, a number of popular creators speak out forcefully against the Andrew Tates of the world. Some, like TikTok superstar Drew Afualo, do so with the intent to protect women and other marginalized voices from hate – not necessarily to change the minds of the men who level it. To enact change, Bunch says men need to step up and call out bad behavior when they see it.\n\n“Part of the problem is, these men don’t listen to or respect the experiences of women. But they listen to each other,” Bunch says. “If men speak up, other men will respond to that and we’ve found that to be true.\n\nBut, “calling in” is also important, Bunch says. He mentions several male celebrities who are leveraging their fame to introduce healthier ideas of manhood: NBA star Dwayne Wade, who does work supporting the LGBTQ community; actor Benedict Cumberbatch who brings attention to equal pay issues; and actor Justin Baldoni who promotes healthy fatherhood and family.\n\n“There are more and more men doing this, because men are realizing this way of thinking doesn’t work for us,” Bunch says. “It doesn’t feel good.”\n\nThe dangerous influence of misogyny starts with men. Saying so doesn’t need to be an indictment. In that vein, experts say the solution is most effective when it starts with men. That is not an indictment, either. Instead, they hope it can be an opportunity.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/us/rapper-deaths-gun-violence-reaj/index.html", "title": "Gun violence has killed at least 1 rapper every year since 2018 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s happened again: America wakes up to news that a hip-hop star was fatally and senselessly shot. This time, the rapper is Takeoff of Atlanta’s platinum hit machine, Migos, who was slain early Tuesday in Houston, according to a source close to the group.\n\nHouston police responded to the scene of a downtown shooting at a bowling alley and pool hall, finding one person dead, the department said. Two other victims were taken in private vehicles to hospitals.\n\nTakeoff’s death is the latest in a trend that stretches back to 2018. Each year since then, gun violence – whether through robbery or disagreement – has killed at least one rapper who was either already famous or on the cusp of crossover fame.\n\nThe 28-year-old rhymesmith, who was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, had just released a project with his uncle and Migos bandmate, Quavo, titled, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” the album’s name a shoutout to the 1995 debut solo effort from Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon. Quavo and Takeoff had recently announced they’d be performing under the moniker, “Unc & Phew.”\n\nHours before he was killed, Takeoff tweeted the video to the single, “Messy,” off the project. On the track, Takeoff rhymes, “Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever/Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain’t gonna tell ‘em.” On Friday, he tweeted about performing in Miami.\n\nLast month, he and Quavo appeared on the podcast, “Drink Champs,” and in response to praise for his lyricism on “Infinity Links,” Takeoff told listeners, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”\n\nIn addition to his work with Quavo and Migos, Takeoff released a solo album in 2018, “The Last Rocket,” which hit No. 4 on the US charts.\n\nFrom left, Takeoff, DJ Mustard and Quavo perform at the BET Awards in Los Angeles in 2019. Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nNews of Takeoff’s killing rocked hip-hop, but his loss is being felt well beyond the bounds of music as many chimed in to offer condolences and praise, while others questioned what needs to be done to stop the scourge of rappers being killed.\n\n“Too many young men of color are killing each other,” tweeted Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. “Resolving their disputes by pulling their guns and shooting one another regardless of fame or fortune. Crazy. And in a few second a life is gone, families and friends are left grieving. STOP!”\n\nJournalist Jewel Wicker offered some additional career insight from an interview with Takeoff’s uncle, writing, “Takeoff, the then-kid who convinced his uncle (Quavo) to start rapping then helped change the flow of rap. The undisputed best rapper in Migos (his uncle told me so himself just a few months ago). What a loss.” She further reported Takeoff earned his stage name from his ability to “just launch into his verses and record everything in a single, pristine take.”\n\nFellow writer Jemele Hill added, “I was in college when Biggie and ‘Pac were killed and thought there was no way we’d ever experience anything remotely close to that again. Now it’s happening so frequently that you barely have time to recover before someone else killed. RIP Takeoff.”\n\nRapper Ja Rule felt similarly, writing, “this s**t has to STOP,” while fellow rap star, Lecrae, wrote, “No hot takes. No profound thoughts. Just sad that another rapper, son, brother, and friend has been killed. God be with all those who feel the loss.”\n\nRolling Stone Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman tweeted out a 2015 article in which Takeoff spoke of his dedication to his craft.\n\n“You couldn’t tell me I wasn’t going to be who I was,” he said. “I knew I was going to be here.”\n\nTakeoff now joins the list of rappers who were victims of gun violence. Here are some other notable artists killed since 2018:\n\n2018: XXXTentacion\n\nXXXTentacion, seen here in 2017, found fame after going viral on social media. Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock\n\nXXXTentacion was gunned down June 18, 2018, in an apparent robbery as he left a motorsports store in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\nFour men were arrested that year in connection with the rapper’s killing. They were indicted on murder and other charges, and one suspect pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is expected to testify against the other three, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.\n\nThe 20-year-old was wildly popular at the time of his death. He rocketed to fame after his song, “Look at Me,” went viral on social media and SoundCloud in 2016.\n\nHe went on to be featured in XXL magazine’s 2017 Freshman Class alongside other up-and-coming artists. His album “?” premiered at No. 1 when it was released in March 2018, according to Billboard.\n\nThe album’s single “Sad!” peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks on the charts, according to Billboard.\n\nRight after his death, “Sad!” moved from No. 52 to No. 1 on Billboard ‘s Hot 100 chart. The song was the first posthumous No. 1 for a lead soloist since The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” in 1997, according to Billboard.\n\nThe rapper was not without controversy: He was accused of homophobia after telling a story on a podcast of choking and severely beating a cellmate he suspected was gay while they both were housed in a juvenile detention center. He had also been awaiting trial for a domestic violence incident involving his pregnant girlfriend.\n\n2019: Nipsey Hussle\n\nNipsey Hussle was fatally shot in March 2019 near a clothing store he owned. Shutterstock\n\nNipsey Hussle, an award-winning hip-hop artist and philanthropist, was shot at least 10 times on March 31, 2019, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe rapper’s last message on Twitter read: “Having strong enemies is a blessing.” It was later found that a conversation about snitching preceded his fatal shooting, according to grand jury testimony.\n\nAuthorities said Eric Holder fired the shots that killed Nipsey and wounded two other people. Holder, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the rapper’s death. According to numerous hip-hop publications, his September sentencing date was postponed to this month.\n\nNipsey had been well-known on the underground circuit, and he was gaining a mainstream following just before his death.\n\nA year earlier, he launched the first Marathon Clothing smart store in Los Angeles. Nipsey also owned The Marathon Agency marketing company, investment firm SC Commercial Ventures and the record labels Proud 2 Pay and All Money In No Money Out Records, according to Press Atlantic Records.\n\nThe 33-year-old was nominated for best rap album during the 2019 Grammys for the only studio album he ever released, “Victory Lap.” He lost to Cardi B.\n\nBeyond his music and businesses, Nipsey was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips but spoke out against rappers who would boast of purported gang affiliations to stunt or look cool – not because he wished them any violence, but to remind them that for too many young people, joining a gang was about survival.\n\n2020: Pop Smoke\n\nPop Smoke died the month before he was scheduled to go on tour. Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images\n\nNew York rapper Pop Smoke was fatally shot during a home invasion at a Hollywood Hills, California, residence February 19, 2020.\n\nSeveral people were detained and released following the rapper’s death.

Instead of identifying as a girl, Amelia began to feel different. About six months after turning 12, Amelia was ready to lean into a new life. The young person celebrated with new pronouns: they/them.\n\n\"My pronouns now put me at a place where I can decide between different genders,\" says Amelia, 13. Courtesy Amelia Blackney\n\n“I didn’t feel like a girl, but I never really felt like a boy, so I had to find something that was in the middle of both,” Amelia said. “I settled on pronouns that didn’t represent a gender but instead put me between two genders. That way it’s like I’m not a part of any gender or I can be both genders at the same time. My pronouns now put me at a place where I can decide between different genders. That feels right.”\n\nAmelia, who now identifies as nonbinary, isn’t the only young person changing pronouns these days; across the country tweens and teens are embracing nongendered iterations of these familiar words.\n\nWhile it’s hard to find data on people who are changing pronouns, anecdotal evidence suggests that more are ditching gendered words for those that are less gender-specific and more flexible across the board. And some parts of society are keeping up: Many people in educational institutions and corporate life are including their chosen pronouns in their email signatures (some with links to why they matter), and Zoom has room for people to show their pronouns in their name listings.\n\nExperts say three main factors are driving the phenomenon: More information about gender fluidity on the internet, a spike in the number of high-profile celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Nico Tortorella embracing nongendered pronouns, and pronouns showing up more frequently in communication technology.\n\n“I’m seeing more young people pause and assess who they are separate from who people expect them to be,” said Justine Ang Fonte, a health and sex educator based in New York City. “It’s a powerful pause, a powerful reflection and exercise. It’s leading to some important realizations for everyone involved.”\n\nWhat’s in these words?\n\nAt first glance, words such as he, him, she and her seem insignificant; they’re short and monosyllabic, and they’re not nearly as formal as the proper nouns they represent.\n\nFor those grappling with gender identity, however, pronouns are a lot more than a group of words that can function as nouns, Fonte said. Using someone’s correct personal pronouns is a way to respect them and create an inclusive environment, just as using a person’s name can be a way to show that person you see and appreciate them.\n\nWhat’s more, actively choosing to ignore the pronouns someone has stated they use could imply that intersex, transgender, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming people do not or should not exist. Many who change pronouns go from the binary he/him or she/her to something more expansive such as they/them. Others opt for different versions of these traditional words — pronouns such as ey/em, ze/zir, xe/xir and more.\n\nWhile some call these alternate pronouns “neopronouns,” other experts say they’re not new at all.\n\nDennis Baron, professor emeritus of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has spent more than 40 years researching the quest for a gender-neutral, third-person singular pronoun in English, and his 2020 book, “What’s Your Pronoun? Beyond He and She,” spotlights this very subject.\n\nBaron’s interest in pronouns has uncovered more than 200 coined pronouns over time. He noted that William Shakespeare regularly used the singular “they.”\n\n“We tend to think of pronouns as a closed category, but throughout time they have been very open,” said Baron, who uses he/him. “They are common words. We tend to treat them as not very important. And yet they are powerful.”\n\nFluidity is in\n\nA growing subset of young people is taking another approach: They are adopting identities for which any pronouns will work.\n\nTake Sylvia Chesak, for example. The 14-year-old from Cincinnati said they use “any pronouns,” which is a conscious decision to accept any pronoun at any time — a reflection of a gender identity Sylvia said is rich, deep, complicated and beautiful.\n\n\"People my age talk about gender/sexuality identity very openly,\" says Sylvia, 14. Courtesy Sylvia Chesak\n\n“With my old pronouns I just struggled to imagine myself as she/her and I struggled to just hear she/her,” Sylvia wrote via text message. “When I realized that I was uncomfortable thinking of myself like that I began exploring more pronoun options. I saw someone online who used any pronouns and started imagining myself as identifying like that. It was the first time I felt comfortable imagining myself and who I was, and I decided to feel good about myself (so) I would start using any pronouns.”\n\nSylvia added that roughly one-third of their fellow ninth graders have changed pronouns in the last year or two.\n\n“People my age talk about gender/sexuality identity very openly, often asking unprompted about people’s pronouns,” Sylvia wrote. “I’m glad to be in a community that understands how important pronouns are, while also willing to discuss them in any environment.”\n\nThese sorts of comments make Ignacio Rivera happy.\n\nRivera, who uses they/them pronouns, is founder and director of the HEAL Proect, a Somerville, Massachusetts-based nonprofit that teaches kids about healthy living.\n\nRivera noted nongendered pronouns apply to all people, not just those in the queer and gender-nonconforming communities. They added that it’s critical to encourage young people to explore their own identities in a variety of ways.\n\n“Denying young people that right only speaks to the power and control adults have over young people; it doesn’t allow for them to experience life on their terms,” Rivera said.\n\nBroadening the conversation\n\nPronouns certainly have become part of the zeitgeist in the modern era.\n\nActors, singers and celebrities who have come out as nonbinary or gender fluid in recent years include Lovato, Tortorella, Cara Delevingne, Ruby Rose and Sam Smith.\n\nPronouns also are popping up in books for children and for young adults.\n\nThe 2021 children’s book “What Are Your Words?” focuses squarely on the topic, presenting it in a way that is accessible and understandable for children as young as age 4.\n\nAuthor Katherine Locke wrote the words to the book, hoping that it will spark conversations between kids and adults about gender and pronouns overall.\n\n“I want kids and parents to understand that pronouns can change, just as we can change,” said Locke, who uses they/them. “Many adults don’t have the language to talk about pronouns and gender. Kids innately do. The book is a moment for kids to model behavior for their parents. It’s a chance to learn that who children are discovering themselves to be is worth celebrating.”\n\nMaia Kobabe, a nonbinary author and illustrator who uses e/em/eir pronouns, turned eir life story into the 2019 autobiographical graphic novel, “Gender Queer.” The book contains images that prompted school boards in 11 states to ban or challenge it last year. By the end of the narrative, Kobabe has taken readers through a journey to gender independence.\n\n“I began to think of gender less as a scale and more as a landscape,” Kobabe wrote. “Some people are happy to live in the place they were born, while others must make a journey to reach the climate in which they can flourish and grow.”\n\nSparking conversations with others\n\nIt’s one thing for tweens and teens to embrace new pronouns; it’s something entirely different for the grown-ups in their lives to embrace the new words.\n\nFonte, the sex educator, suggests grown-ups can incorporate a simple query about pronouns into their standard greeting when meeting a young person for the first time.\n\n“In addition to asking, ‘What’s your name?’ you can ask, ‘What are your pronouns?’ ” she said. “We can’t assume a specific pronoun or gender identity because someone is wearing a skirt, or they play football.”\n\nFor parents of kids who change pronouns, the initial response is everything.\n\nData from the Family Acceptance Project, an ongoing research effort at San Francisco State University, indicates that how parents and families react to kids when they come out or share information about their gender identities has lifelong impacts on children’s mental health, wellness and physical health.\n\nRivera, from the HEAL Project, said the best way to digest news of new pronouns is with curiosity.\n\n“You can say, ‘Wow! Thanks for telling me. What do these new words mean to you?’ ” they said. “If you’re curious about something, that means the young person will be comfortable responding to you. If you’re interested in what they have to say, they’ll feel safe and continue sharing.”\n\nJessica Carroll, director of programs at Positive Images, an LGBTQ center serving kids in Sonoma County, California, said parents can admit they likely will “mess up” a child’s new pronouns many times before incorporating the words into everyday parlance. Carroll added that the burden is on parents to adapt.\n\n“Don’t wait to be corrected. Make the effort to fix mistakes,” she said. “Showing you are committed to embracing a young person’s pronouns will go a long way to making that child feel heard and seen.”", "authors": ["Matt Villano"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}]}

Biden had taken the antiviral medication Paxlovid, which has been associated with some patients testing positive again for the virus after completing treatment.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Paxlovid rebound. What is it exactly, and why does it happen? How common is it, and does the possibility of a recurrence of symptoms mean that people shouldn’t take it? Who should and shouldn’t take the drug? And what should you do if you do have a recurrence?\n\nTo guide us through all these issues, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nCNN: What is Paxlovid rebound, and why does it happen?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: The phenomenon known as Paxlovid rebound is what happens when someone with Covid-19 takes the antiviral pill Paxlovid and begins to recover – their symptoms improve, and they start testing negative. Then, usually within two weeks of their initial diagnosis, they have a recurrence in their symptoms, and they test positive for the coronavirus again. In President Joe Biden’s case, he was being tested regularly, so even though his symptoms didn’t recur, his positive test was picked up right away.\n\nThe anti-viral medication Paxlovid is given for five days to reduce severe illness in someone with Covid-19. Stephanie Nano/AP\n\nIt’s not known exactly why this is occurring. A small study out of the University of California, San Diego found that this isn’t due to Paxlovid being rendered ineffective against variants. The very small window of time when it happens also suggests this is not due to reinfection. Rather, a lot of scientists, including me, think that this is most likely due to Paxlovid working as it should but not for long enough.\n\nPaxlovid works to stop viral replication. It is currently given for five days. Perhaps it works for the five-day period, but some people still have virus in their body after five days. When Paxlovid is stopped, the virus starts replicating again.\n\nIt’s possible that Paxlovid may need to be given for a longer period of time – maybe seven or 10 days instead of five days. Those studies are ongoing.\n\nCNN: It seems like a lot of people have Paxlovid rebound, including President Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci. How common is it?\n\nWen: Anecdotally, we may know a lot of people who’ve had it, but studies show that it’s pretty uncommon.\n\nThe initial studies found that rebound occurred in about 2% of cases. By the way, those who did not take Paxlovid also had a chance of recurrence. In that study, the placebo group had a recurrence of symptoms in 1.5% of cases.\n\nThose studies were done during a time when the Delta variant was the dominant variant. The rates of rebound may be higher during Omicron. A large study of over 13,000 patients done by researchers from the National Institutes of Health found a rebound rate of about 6%. Note that this study is online but not yet peer-reviewed.\n\nOf course, the actual rate may be higher, because people are not routinely being tested after they take Paxlovid. Some cases may be missed as a result. However, it still seems that Paxlovid rebound is occurring in a minority, not majority, of cases.\n\nCNN: Does the possibility of a recurrence of symptoms mean that people shouldn’t take it?\n\nWen: No. I think people should consider the possibility of Paxlovid rebound like a known side effect of the medication. It’s certainly not preferred to have this, given the inconvenience of having repeat symptoms and having to isolate again. However, the possibility of this side effect is not a reason to avoid a medication that is highly effective at reducing severe illness.\n\nThis comes down to why Paxlovid is given in the first place. It is an oral medication, prescribed so that people can take it at home, that can reduce the likelihood of being hospitalized or dying by nearly 90%. Neither Fauci nor Biden got severely ill. That’s the success story here – and the reason why people eligible for Paxlovid should still take it despite the possibility of rebound.\n\nCNN: Who is eligible for Paxlovid? Are there people who shouldn’t take it?\n\nWen: The people eligible for Paxlovid are individuals who are vulnerable to severe outcomes if they were to contract Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a list of these conditions. They include older age and chronic underlying medical problems such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes and obesity. People who remain unvaccinated are at higher risk for severe Covid-19, too.\n\nThere are certain medical conditions people may have that either exclude them from taking Paxlovid, or they have to take a different dose. Some medications also interfere with Paxlovid and may need to be stopped for a short time. That’s why it’s critical to check with your physician. I encourage you to check with your health care provider, even if you haven’t contracted Covid-19, to know whether you are eligible for Paxlovid.\n\nAs far as people who shouldn’t take it, Paxlovid is intended for individuals at high risk for severe disease. If you are under 50, up to date with vaccines and generally healthy, you should not take it. Every medication is about weighing risks and benefits. If you are unlikely to benefit, the risks will outweigh the benefits.\n\nCNN: What should you do if you do have a recurrence – do you take Paxlovid again, and do you need to isolate?\n\nWen: Paxlovid rebound is very unlikely to progress to severe illness, as a recent CDC report found. It is not currently recommended to take Paxlovid for rebound cases, though this is a recommendation that could change as more studies are under way. (Fauci’s doctors prescribed another course of Paxlovid.)\n\nThe CDC does say that individuals with rebound infections should isolate for another five days. That’s because an individual who is testing positive again by rapid home antigen test is shedding virus and could still be contagious to others.\n\nUsing caution is the right approach, but I want to emphasize again that the possibility of rebound should not dissuade people from taking a treatment that is doing what it should, which is to keep people out of the hospital and preventing them from getting severely ill.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/health/rsv-symptoms-treatments-wellness/index.html", "title": "RSV in children: Symptoms, treatment and what parents should ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn September, an 8-month-old baby came into Dr. Juanita Mora’s office in Chicago with an infection the doctor hadn’t expected to see for another two months: RSV.\n\nLike her peers across the country, the allergist and immunologist has been treating little ones with this cold-like virus well before the season usually starts.\n\n“We’re seeing RSV infections going rampant all throughout the country,” Mora said.\n\nAlmost all children catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Most adults who catch it have a mild illness; for those who are elderly or who have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, it can be dangerous. But RSV can be especially tricky for infants and kids.\n\nMora, a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association, says it’s important for parents, caregivers and daycare workers to know what to watch for with RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus. That way, they know whether a sick child can be treated at home or needs to go to a hospital.\n\n“The emergency department is getting completely flooded with all these sick kids, so we want parents to know they can go to their pediatrician and get tested for RSV, influenza and even Covid-19,” Mora said.\n\nHere’s what else parents need to know amid the surge of respiratory illnesses.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nFor many, RSV causes a mild illness that can be managed at home.\n\nOn average, an infection lasts five days to a couple of weeks, and it will often go away on its own, the CDC says. Sometimes, the cough can linger for up to four weeks, pediatricians say.\n\nSymptoms may look like a common cold: a runny nose, a decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. Young infants may seem only irritable or lethargic and have trouble breathing.\n\nNot every child will have every potential RSV symptom.\n\n“Fevers are really hit or miss with RSV infections, especially in young infants,” said Dr. Priya Soni, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.\n\nParents should watch for any changes in behavior, she said, including taking longer to eat or not being interested in food at all. The child can also develop a severe cough and some wheezing.\n\nIt’s also important to watch for signs that your child is struggling to breathe or breathing with their ribs or belly – “symptoms which may kind of overlap with many of the other viruses that we’re seeing a resurgence of,” Soni added.\n\nSince it’s not easy for parents to tell the difference between respiratory illnesses like, say, RSV and flu, it’s good to take a sick child to a pediatrician, who can run tests to pinpoint the cause.\n\n“You may need to take your baby to be evaluated sooner rather than later,” Soni said.\n\nWhen it comes to RSV, parents should be especially cautious if their children are preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\n“Parents should be really astute to any changes, like in their activity and their appetite, and then pay particular attention to any signs of respiratory distress,” Soni said.\n\nRSV treatment\n\nTesting is important because treatment for things like flu and Covid-19 may differ.\n\nThere’s no antiviral or specific treatment for RSV like there is for the flu, nor is there a vaccine. But if your child is sick, there are things you can do to help.\n\nFever and pain can be managed with non-aspirin pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Also make sure your child drinks enough fluids.\n\n“RSV can make kids very dehydrated, especially when they’re not eating or drinking, especially when we’re talking infants,” Mora said. “Once they stop eating or their urine output has decreased, they’re not having as many wet diapers, this is a sign they may have to go to the pediatrician or emergency department.”\n\nTalk to your pediatrician before giving your child any over-the-counter cold medicines, which can sometimes contain ingredients that aren’t good for kids.\n\nWhen to go to the hospital\n\nYour pediatrician will check the child’s respiratory rate – how fast they’re breathing – and their oxygen levels. If your child is very sick or at high risk of severe illness, the doctor may want them to go to a hospital.\n\n“RSV can be super dangerous for some young infants and younger kids, particularly those that are less than 2 years of age,” Soni said.\n\nMora said labored breathing is a sign that a child is having trouble with this virus. RSV can turn into more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and that can lead to respiratory failure.\n\nIf you see that a child’s chest is moving up and down when they breathe, if their cough won’t let them sleep or if it’s getting worse, “that might be a sign that they need to seek help from their pediatrician or take them to the emergency department, because then they might need a supplemental oxygen, or they may need a nebulization treatment.”\n\nCNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen says this respiratory difficulty – including a bobbing head, a flaring nose or grunting – is one of two major trouble signs with any respiratory infection. The other is dehydration. “That particularly applies to babies with stuffy noses. They may not be feeding.”\n\nMuch of the care provided by hospital staff will be to help with breathing.\n\n“We provide supportive measures for RSV and these kids with oxygen, IV fluids and respiratory therapies, including suctioning,” Soni said.\n\nA thin tube may need to be inserted into their lungs to remove mucus. A child can get extra oxygen through a mask or through a tube that attaches to their nose. Some children may need to use an oxygen tent. Those who are struggling a lot may need a ventilator.\n\nSome babies might also need to be fed by tube.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf a caregiver or older sibling is sick, Mora says, they should wear a mask around other people and wash their hands frequently.\n\nAnd most of all, if anyone is sick – child or adult – they should stay home so they don’t spread the illness.\n\nThere is a monoclonal antibody treatment for children who are at highest risk for severe disease. It’s not available for everyone, but it can protect those who are most vulnerable. It comes in the form of a shot that a child can get every month during the typical RSV season.

It played a part in at least 3,544 deaths in the United States in the first 30 months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a new report says.\n\nThe report is the first official attempt by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics to quantify the number of long Covid deaths in the United States.\n\nSome experts say this finding is probably a significant undercount, considering that up to 30% of people who get Covid-19 go on to have long-term symptoms, according to the CDC.\n\nThe research, published Wednesday, analyzed death certificates in the National Vital Statistics System from January 2020 through the end of June 2022.\n\nThe research was difficult because, unlike with diseases such as cancer or diabetes, the US did not have a specific disease code to track long Covid during that time period.\n\nNot every doctor, medical examiner or coroner fills out a death certificate the same way, so the researchers had to create a program to scan more than a million death certificates for text. Because there is not one settled term to describe long Covid, they included several key terms in their search, including “chronic Covid,” “long Covid” and “post COVID syndrome.”\n\nThey found that long Covid deaths made up less than 0.3% of the 1,021,487 Covid-related deaths from January 2020 through June 2022. There were some common elements among those who died, as well.\n\nDeaths mostly in seniors, Whites, males\n\nThe majority of people who died from long Covid were White, older and male.\n\nSpecifically, 78.5% of the deaths were among non-Hispanic White people. Non-Hispanic Black people made up 10.1% of the deaths, followed by Hispanic people at 7.8%.\n\nThe death rate was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Natives, at 14.8 per 100,000 people.\n\nCovid-19 deaths have disproportionately been among people of color, CDC research shows, and the new report notes that more people who identify as Black or Hispanic may have died of the initial disease before they could even develop long Covid. This may account for some of the racial differences in the new findings.\n\nStudies have also found that with more barriers to health care for people of color, some people who died may not have been able to see a doctor to get an official Covid diagnosis, so it wouldn’t be recognized on a death certificate, the report said.\n\nAdults 75 to 84 accounted for 28.8% of long Covid deaths, followed by people 85 and older at 28.1% and people between 65 and 74 years old at 21.5%, the report says. In general, it is much more common for older adults to die from Covid than younger populations, CDC data shows.\n\nMen accounted for a slightly larger proportion of the deaths, at 51.5%, which fits with other studies finding that being male is associated with a relative risk of developing severe Covid that’s 1.29 times the relative risk for women.\n\nThe new report had several limitations, including that the death numbers are still provisional and could change. Additionally, race is not always a reliable element on a death certificate, as studies have shown that thousands of Americans’ race is misclassified on their certificates. And clinical guidance on what constitutes long Covid has changed over the course of the pandemic, so death certificates may not fully capture the condition.\n\nThe many effects of long Covid\n\nThe study is a good start, but it takes a “fairly myopic view” of death from long Covid, said Dr. David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation for Mount Sinai Health System.\n\n“This is very clearly data from folks who got very sick, ended up at the hospital with sustained organ damage,” said Putrino, who works closely with long Covid patients but was not involved in the new report.\n\nHe says the research misses a sizable number of people who may get long Covid and die as a result.\n\nFor instance, some people who are not hospitalized for an initial infection but get long Covid go on to develop heart problems, studies show. Long Covid would not necessarily be captured on those death certificates, Putrino said.\n\n“We read every single day about people who have previously been healthy, get Covid, recover and then have a heart attack or stroke or pulmonary embolism,” Putrino said.\n\nThis research may also miss people with long Covid who died by suicide; the condition probably wouldn’t be listed on their death certificates.\n\n“We currently know that suicidal thoughts, suicidal acts, suicidal ideation and completed suicides are occurring all around the country with folks who were previously healthy, had a less severe acute Covid infection but then went on to develop very severe post-acute sequelae,” Putrino said.\n\nHe is encouraged that the CDC is looking at the issue of death from long Covid.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“But again, we’re just going to continue to get these sorts of skewed records unless we educate physicians that there are many ways that long Covid can cause death, just like there are many ways long Covid can cause permanent disability,” Putrino said.\n\n“People have had their lives completely ruined by Covid, and so this incomplete data point really only captures a small part of the long Covid experience,” he said. “There are more than one way to have your life taken away from you with long Covid. Death is only one of those ways.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/health/omicron-vaccine-coronavirus-wellness/index.html", "title": "Is Covid-19 surging? Our expert explains how to prepare | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe much-awaited summer lull in coronavirus cases doesn’t appear to be happening as Covid-19 infections continue to increase in much of the United States.\n\nAn earlier rise in cases this year was driven by the BA.2 Omicron subvariant. Now, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that two other subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, constitute more than 70% of new infections in the country. These subvariants may partially escape the immunity produced by the vaccine and by prior infection, though vaccination still likely protects against severe illness.\n\nThese developments are occurring as more people resume travel and other pre-pandemic activities. How should people think about their risk from Covid-19 right now? If they are vaccinated and boosted, are they safe? What about those who recently had Covid-19? What kind of precautions should people take if they still want to avoid Covid-19? And if someone tests positive for the coronavirus, should this person still isolate?\n\nTo help with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nCNN: Do current Covid-19 trends indicate that there is another surge of cases in the United States?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: I’m not sure this would be called another surge because the numbers didn’t really come down from the previous rise. In the winter, from December 2021 to about February 2022, we saw a huge surge in cases from the original Omicron subvariant, BA.1. There was a small lull; then BA.2 came along with that rise in cases. Now, BA.4 and BA.5 are displacing previous Omicron subvariants and are causing most of the infections in the US. Many places are seeing an increase in infections from a high baseline of cases.\n\nWe also have to keep in mind that the number of reported cases is much lower than the actual number of cases. I think we could have anywhere from five to 10 times as many cases as are reported, considering how many cases are diagnosed by home antigen tests and are not reported to public health authorities.\n\nThe good news is that these recent surges have not been accompanied by hospitals being overwhelmed, which illustrates the powerful effect of the vaccines in mostly decoupling infection from severe illness.\n\nCNN: With these kinds of numbers, how should people think about their Covid-19 risk? Does that mean people should cancel travel and bring back restrictions?\n\nWen: I don’t think that most people should have to change their daily activities, but I do think people need to be aware of their risk of contracting Covid-19 if they don’t take additional precautions.\n\nThe good news is that the vaccines and boosters continue to provide excellent protection against severe disease. However, we also know that immunity wanes over time, and there does appear to be some immune (evasion) with BA.4 and BA.5 in particular. That means people who are vaccinated and boosted are unlikely to become severely ill if they contract Covid-19, but they could still become infected.\n\nSome commuters don masks in New York's Times Square subway station last week. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe question people should ask is this: How much do they want to continue to avoid infection? There is so much virus around us, and the variants are so contagious. That means avoiding infection requires additional consideration. Many people may not want to plan their lives around Covid-19 precautions anymore, especially if they are generally healthy and well-protected from severe illness.\n\nOn the other hand, many people may still prioritize not contracting Covid-19 because of the risk of long-haul symptoms. They may also have underlying medical conditions that predispose to more severe outcomes themselves, or they may live with others who are more vulnerable and want to reduce their risk to those around them.\n\nCNN: For people who want to be cautious, what do you recommend?\n\nWen: For individuals who want to prioritize reducing their risk of Covid-19 infection, I’d advise first that they follow the CDC guidance and stay up to date on their boosters. Everyone ages 5 and older can receive a first booster. Those 50 and older can receive a second booster for a total of four shots.\n\nCertain individuals (who are moderately or severely immunocompromised) can receive five shots. (These individuals should also find out if they are eligible for Evusheld, the preventive antibody that can further aid in reducing the progression to severe illness.)\n\nI’d also urge that they wear a high-quality N95 mask or equivalent in indoor, crowded settings. Mask mandates being lifted does not mean that people shouldn’t wear masks. A lot of people don’t find masks to be inconvenient. If that’s the case, I’d continue to wear masks in all indoor public settings. For those who find masks uncomfortable, I’d encourage mask-wearing in the highest-risk settings – for example, mask while in a crowded security line at the airport and during boarding and deplaning.\n\nOf course, remember that outdoor gatherings continue to be much lower risk than indoors. People who want to be very cautious should try to go to outdoor gatherings if possible and then go to indoor gatherings only if others all have negative tests that day.\n\nCNN: A lot of people are sick of hearing about these precautions. What if they just want to live their lives but don’t want to infect vulnerable people?\n\nWen: I certainly understand this sentiment. It’s very hard for society to impose restrictions on individuals and ask people to forever put gatherings like weddings and birthday parties on hold or to forgo going to activities they love like indoor restaurants and gyms. My best advice here is to recognize that if you go to indoor settings, you could contract Covid-19. Be aware of your risk and take precautions accordingly.\n\nFor example, perhaps you can go about living your life as you wish, but before you visit grandma in a nursing home, take a rapid test that day. If you go to a crowded indoor wedding, take a test a few days after to make sure you didn’t contract the coronavirus. And if you have symptoms at any point, immediately test and do not expose others around you.\n\nCNN: Are you safe if you recently had Covid-19?\n\nWen: Recent infection produces some protection that probably lasts for about three months. Reinfection can certainly happen though, and some studies suggest that getting the original Omicron BA.1 does not protect against the newer variants. Vaccination in addition to recent recovery conveys better protection, so make sure you are up to date with your vaccines and boosters, even if you’ve had Covid-19.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCNN: And what if you do test positive – should you still isolate?\n\nWen: Yes, because you don’t want to spread Covid-19 to others. The CDC guidance is that you isolate for five days and then wear a mask around others for an additional five days after that if symptoms are improving. I think a testing policy is even better than this because people remain infected for different lengths of time. I’d encourage people to take home tests daily from day four and to end isolation once their home rapid antigen test is negative.

If you feel caught off-guard, you aren’t alone.\n\nAfter the Omicron tidal wave washed over the United States in January and the smaller rise in cases in the spring caused by the BA.2 subvariant, it might have seemed like the coronavirus could be ignored for a while. After all, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in December that nearly all Americans had been vaccinated or have antibodies from a past infection. Surely all that immunity bought some breathing room.\n\nBut suddenly, many people who had recovered from Covid-19 as recently as March or April found themselves exhausted, coughing and staring at two red lines on a rapid test. How could this be happening again – and so soon?\n\nThe culprit this time is yet another Omicron offshoot, BA.5. It has three key mutations in its spike protein that make it both better at infecting our cells and more adept at slipping past our immune defenses.\n\nIn just over two months, BA.5 outcompeted its predecessors to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the United States. Last week, this subvariant caused almost 2 out of every 3 new Covid-19 infections in this country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n\nLab studies of antibodies from the blood of people who’ve been vaccinated or recovered from recent Covid-19 infections have looked at how well they stand up to BA.5, and this subvariant can outmaneuver them. So people who’ve had Covid as recently as winter or even spring may again be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n“We do not know about the clinical severity of BA.4 and BA.5 in comparison to our other Omicron subvariants,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Tuesday. “But we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5.”\n\nA ‘full-on’ wave\n\nThe result is that we’re getting sick in droves. As Americans have switched to more rapid at-home tests, official case counts – currently hovering around 110,000 new infections a day – reflect just a fraction of the true disease burden.\n\n“We estimate that for every reported case there are 7 unreported,” Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, wrote in an email.\n\nOther experts think the wave could be as much as 10 times higher than what’s being reported now.\n\n“We’re looking at probably close to a million new cases a day,” Dr. Peter Hotez said on CNN. “This is a full-on BA.5 wave that we’re experiencing this summer. It’s actually looking worse in the Southern states, just like 2020, just like 2021,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThat puts us in the range of cases reported during the first Omicron wave, in January. Remember when it seemed like everyone everywhere got sick at the same time? That’s the situation in the United States again.\n\nIt may not seem like a very big deal, because vaccines and better treatments have dramatically cut the risk of death from Covid-19. Still, about 300 to 350 people are dying on average each day from Covid-19, enough to fill a large passenger jet.\n\n“That is unacceptable. It’s too high,” Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Response Team, said at Tuesday’s briefing.\n\nDaily hospitalizations are also climbing in the United States. The fraction of patients needing intensive care is up by about 23% over the past two weeks. And other countries are experiencing BA.5 waves, too.\n\n“I am concerned that cases of Covid-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers. I am also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at a news briefing Tuesday after the agency’s decision to maintain its emergency declaration for Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, is “nowhere near over.”\n\nWhat’s at stake with continued spread\n\nThere are also more insidious health risks to consider. A recent preprint study that compared the health of people who’d been infected one or more times with Covid-19 found that the risk of new and sometimes lasting health problems rose with each subsequent infection, suggesting that reinfections are not necessarily benign.\n\nAlthough vaccination reduces the risk of getting long Covid, a certain percentage of people have lasting symptoms after a breakthrough infection.\n\nThat’s another reason why high numbers of Covid-19 cases are a big deal: Because the virus is still spreading wildly, it has every opportunity to mutate to make even fitter and more infectious versions of itself. It’s doing this faster than we can change our vaccines, leaving us stuck in the Covid-rinse-repeat period of the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pleaded with Americans to use all available tools to stop the spread of the virus, including masking, ventilation and social distancing.\n\n“We need to keep the levels of virus to the lowest possible level, and that is our best defense. If a virus is not very robustly replicating and spreading, it gives it less of a chance of a mutation, which gives it less of a chance of the evolving of another variant,” Fauci said in a news briefing.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening.\n\nMeet BA.2.75\n\nEven as the US comes to terms with BA.5, variant hunters around the world are closely watching another Omicron descendant, BA.2.75. It’s been detected in about 10 countries, including the United States, and seems to be growing quickly in India.\n\nBA.2.75 has nine changes in its spike region that distinguish it from BA.2 and about 11 changes compared with BA.5, according to Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSeveral of the mutations in BA.2.75 are in a region of the spike protein known to be an important place for antibodies to bind to stop the virus, said Ulrich Elling, a scientist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences who monitors coronavirus variants for that country.\n\nThere’s little information to go on: It’s still not known, for example, how BA.2.75 may compete against BA.5 or whether it causes more severe illness. But experts say it has all the hallmarks of a variant that could go global.\n\n“It spread to many different countries already, so we know that it has some sort of staying power,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease for Helix Labs, which decodes virus samples for the CDC and other clients.\n\nBecause of that, and because of changes in the region of the virus that our antibodies look for to shut it down, “we sort of know ahead of time that this one will cause some trouble,” Luo said.\n\nBased on what we know now, she expects that this subvariant could drive a fall Covid-19 wave in the United States.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the meantime, Jha said, people should get boosters that are available to them to keep their immunity as strong as possible. US health officials emphasized that people who are boosted now will still be able to get an updated shot this fall that includes the BA.4 and BA.5 strains.\n\nJha specifically urged Americans who are 50 and older, “if you’ve not gotten a vaccine shot this year, go get one now.

Covid-19 cases are on the rise, too, and a CNN analysis showed that hospitals are at higher capacity now than they have been throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhat can families do in advance of holidays gatherings and what measures can they implement during the festivities to keep viruses at bay? When should everyone wear masks? How can people reduce the risk of getting sick on flights and during transit? Who might want to consider postponing travel and holiday celebrations? And what should people do if they do become ill after gatherings?\n\nTo help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nCNN: What can families do now to preserve their holiday get-togethers as much as possible?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: It’s always important to stay healthy, and particularly so before the holidays. Even if people aren’t so concerned about getting ill, no one wants to become infected just before a long-awaited holiday get-together and have to miss events for fear of transmitting viruses to elderly loved ones and other high-risk family and friends.\n\nMy advice is to first identify which gatherings are most important for you to attend. Count backward from the first of these events. For about five days to a week before that first event, try to reduce your risk of catching respiratory viruses as much as possible.\n\nThis year's winter holidays and celebrations are taking place during multiple viral surges. sonyakamoz/Adobe Stock\n\nThat includes frequent handwashing, especially after touching frequently used surfaces. Wear a high-quality N95 or equivalent mask in all indoor crowded settings. And try to reduce unmasked social gatherings during this period.\n\nIf you have not already received the flu vaccine or the updated Covid-19 booster, do not delay. The vaccines reach optimal protection about two weeks after the inoculation, but even if it’s a little bit less than that until your events, there will still be some additional protection.\n\nI’d also encourage you to have a discussion with all the households that are getting together with you. Ideally, everyone who is gathering should reduce their risk, too. If there are vulnerable individuals expected at the gatherings, everyone should agree not to attend if they develop symptoms like fever and coughing.\n\nCNN: What measures can help keep viruses at bay during the gatherings?\n\nWen: Many respiratory infections like influenza, RSV and the common cold are primarily spread through droplets. Droplets are expelled when someone coughs or sneezes. This is why encouraging people not to attend if they are symptomatic is important, and so is good hand hygiene.\n\nThe coronavirus is airborne and spread through aerosols, which are tiny, microscopic droplets. Good ventilation helps to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. If you live in a warm weather environment, consider hosting your gathering outdoors — that will be lower risk than indoors.\n\nIf outdoors is not possible, consider your setting. Can you choose a larger space where people don’t need to cluster very close together? Can you keep some windows and doors open, and run HEPA filters for improved ventilation?\n\nFor Covid-19 specifically, having everyone take a rapid home antigen test the same day as the gathering can also reduce risk. You may choose to provide the tests at the door to better ensure that everyone takes one.\n\nWearing a mask also reduces risk, too. Some people, especially if they are immunocompromised or have other chronic underlying conditions, may wish to mask during the gathering, though this is often challenging when food and drinks are involved.\n\nCNN: A lot of people need to travel to be with their loved ones. What can be done to reduce the risk of getting sick on flights and during transit?\n\nWen: Expect that airports, train stations and bus depots will be quite crowded during the holidays and plan ahead to reduce your risk in these crowds. If your goal is to keep safe during the holidays, I highly recommend masking in these settings. Even if you have returned to pre-pandemic activities and stopped masking months ago, I think it’s a good idea to get your mask back out in these crowds so that you don’t become sick and end up having to miss holiday gatherings.\n\nHigh-quality respiratory masks, such as N95, KN95 or KF94, are very protective against droplets. Figure out, if you have not already, which masks you can wear comfortably for long periods of time during transit. Bring several with you in case one of them gets soiled or bent out of shape.\n\nEveryone should have a plan for what happens if they develop a viral illness while traveling, says Dr. Leana Wen. Yelizaveta Tomashevska/Adobe Stock\n\nI encourage you to wear masks the whole time while traveling around a lot of people. If you find masks uncomfortable, at least wear them during the highest risk settings — for example, when packed together with dozens of other people waiting to board the plane.\n\nCNN: Who might want to consider postponing travel and/or holiday celebrations?\n\nWen: The threat of respiratory infections requires weighing risks and benefits. For most generally healthy people, especially if they are vaccinated against the flu and Covid-19, the benefits of holiday gatherings — including the socialization and mental health benefits — will far outweigh potential risks.\n\nThe calculation may be different for some individuals who are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes. These individuals may need to gauge each event separately. A small gathering with relatives who all took precautions in advance, who are doing a Covid-19 test at the door, and who are seeing one another in a well-ventilated space is much lower risk compared with, say, a New Year’s Eve celebration with hundreds of people who have not taken precautions.\n\nTravel is generally not the major concern; one-way masking with a high-quality mask works very well to protect the wearer. I’m much more concerned about the risk of the gathering once people are together.\n\nPeople who are particularly vulnerable should clarify the precautions in advance with the hosts. Importantly, they should feel empowered to leave if the event turns out to be higher risk than they anticipated.\n\nCNN: What should people do if they do become ill while traveling?\n\nWen: This is a very important point. Everyone should have a plan for what happens if they develop a viral illness while traveling. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a checklist of what a Covid-19 plan looks like. That includes, for example, making sure you have enough home tests, speaking with your doctor to know if you are high-risk, and having a plan for treatment, including with the antiviral medication Paxlovid.\n\nSince it’s not just Covid-19 that’s circulating, also have a plan for what happens if you or someone in your party develops the flu or other respiratory infections. Do you know where you can isolate if needed? What if a young child becomes ill — will you be able to quarantine with your child and then take time off from work if necessary?\n\nThis holiday season, there are a lot of circulating viruses, but we also have many tools that help to reduce the risk of contracting them and becoming severely ill. Using these tools helps to keep us healthy, and allows us to keep viruses from interfering with our holiday celebrations.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/health/pcr-vs-antigen-tests-covid-19-wellness/index.html", "title": "PCR vs. antigen tests: Which you should take after having Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA PCR test is often considered the gold standard for detecting coronavirus infection. It’s the test some employers want employees to take before returning to work after having Covid-19, and the one some people scramble to schedule to know whether they can travel or stop isolating. But experts say the PCR test isn’t the best one for every situation.\n\nPCR – or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction – tests can detect small amounts of the coronavirus’ genetic material in a specimen collected from a human. The test then works by amplifying, or making copies of, that genetic material if any is present in a person’s sample, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe test’s amplifying property enables it to detect very small amounts of coronavirus in a specimen, “making these tests highly sensitive for diagnosing COVID-19,” according to the CDC. While this sensitivity can be advantageous for detecting coronavirus after a recent exposure, it also means PCR results can be positive even after you’re no longer contagious.\n\nA worker at a drive-up coronavirus testing clinic administers PCR coronavirus tests in Puyallup, Washington state, on January 4. Ted S. Warren/AP/FILE\n\nA PCR test might say you’re positive for coronavirus for three or four weeks after you’ve recovered because it’s still “picking up past infection and the small fragments (of the virus) are still being amplified,” said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. After seven to 10 days, “that PCR test is not an appropriate test.”\n\nRegardless of your situation, here’s what you need to know about the differences between PCR and antigen tests (called rapid lateral flow tests in the UK) and when you should use them.\n\nWhen a PCR test is key\n\nThe prime time to take a PCR test is when you have had a known or suspected exposure to someone with Covid-19 or are experiencing symptoms, and you want to find out if you have a coronavirus infection, said Dr. Albert Ko, the Raj and Indra Nooyi Professor of Public Health at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\nKnowing your Covid-19 status as early in an infection as possible can help you figure out whether you’re infectious to other people, what to tell recent close contacts for their own safety, and what to share with your doctor so they can talk with you about your symptoms and prescribe any medical care if needed, said Emily Somers, an epidemiologist who holds professorships in internal medicine, environmental health sciences, and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan’s schools of medicine and public health.\n\nThat’s important because “up to two days before symptoms, or the one day or two days after symptoms (begin) people can have the highest risk of infecting others,” Ko said. When people are first exposed, it takes time for the virus to replicate enough for a test to pick up on it, Ko explained. PCR tests detect it earlier in the course of infection after exposure than the less sensitive rapid antigen test, which works by detecting a specific protein on one of the coronavirus’ spikes.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has authorized use of both PCR tests and rapid antigen tests in laboratory-based or point-of-care settings (such as a physician’s office, urgent care facility, pharmacy, school health clinic and temporary locations like drive-through testing sites). Antigen tests are also commonly available as self-tests.\n\nWhen rapid antigen tests are crucial\n\nContrary to what some still think is best, a rapid antigen test (or rapid lateral flow test) is what you should be taking after you have had Covid-19 for several days and want to confirm you’re probably no longer infectious to other people. “‘Infected’ means that I have the virus in me,” Ko explained. “’Infectious’ means that I’m shedding enough virus to infect somebody else, and that only occurs during a peak. It follows a curve after someone has been exposed.”\n\nThe CDC’s current isolation guidance is that if people have access to a coronavirus test and want to take it, the best approach is using a rapid test toward the end of their five-day isolation period. Those who continue to test positive at that point should continue isolating until they reach 10 days after their symptoms began. People who test negative can stop isolating but should wear a mask around others until day 10.\n\nAaron Salvador swabs his nose with a coronavirus rapid antigen test kit in Washington, DC, on December 29, 2021. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images/FILE\n\n“Even though the rapid (antigen) test has low sensitivity and is inferior to the PCR test to tell you if you’ve been infected, because of its lower sensitivity, it picks up only viruses at a higher level and probably levels that are more infectious,” Ko explained.\n\n“At this point, we don’t have an FDA-cleared test that can tell us exactly” how much virus is needed to be infectious to other people, Ko added. But evolving evidence has led public health experts to think that rapid tests do better than PCR tests at capturing when people are exiting the period of maximum infectiousness, since PCR tests are too sensitive, he said.\n\n“We have other data to indicate at what point somebody is no longer infectious,” Wen said. A UK preprint study published in December 2021 found that after five days of coronavirus infection, 31% of people were still infectious. On day eight, that percentage dropped to 11% and continued to decrease over the next several days.\n\n“Having the presence of two rapid tests – two days in a row – that are both negative is a very good indicator a person is no longer infectious,” Somers said.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that being contagious at this point is totally impossible – it just means that once you have had Covid-19 for several days and then test negative with a rapid antigen test, the viral RNA is likely at levels low enough to not be infectious (even if you still test positive on a PCR test).\n\nThere have been many online reports of employers requiring people to show proof of a negative PCR test before they return to work, which is “probably not coherent thinking” and has people not returning to work until weeks after their initial rapid antigen or PCR test, Ko said.\n\n“I would highly urge individuals to contact their HR (human resources department) – or if there’s a medical or Covid lead on their teams – and escalate the issue because it’s not reasonable,” Wen said.\n\nIn addition to being more convenient, the most logical return-to-work testing strategy is using rapid antigen tests, Ko said.\n\n“Just as with any test for anything, if you use it for the wrong purpose, you’re going to get an inappropriate result,” Wen added. However, “if somebody has had multiple antigen tests that are negative, but they have symptoms of Covid, having a PCR test can help to confirm if they have it or not.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSome places, such as Antarctica and Kosovo, require travelers to show proof of a negative PCR test before entering. “If the requirement is a PCR within like 72 hours of travel or similar, a lot can happen in those three days,” Somers said. “That negative PCR from a specimen that was taken three days before travel may not be any better than a rapid on the day of travel.\n\n“For the issue of somebody who had an infection and is recovering, I think this is where it’s really an administrative decision in terms of how much risk the country is willing to take (or) how much margin of error,” she added. “If a country is trying to be extremely strict in terms of keeping out all infections, then having a negative PCR will be a more sure way of doing that. However, it’s going to potentially prolong the amount of time between when somebody can enter the country compared to when they were infectious.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/us/yellowstone-river-house-flooding/index.html", "title": "Montana couple sees their house fall into the Yellowstone River | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nEarlier this week, TJ and Victoria Britton watched their home in Gardiner, Montana – along with its 16 years of memories – fall into the Yellowstone River after historic rainfall and flooding inundated waterways in the area.\n\n“It’s something I never in a million years thought was even possible. … It’s still unbelievable,” TJ told CNN’s “New Day” on Friday morning.\n\nSince last weekend, Yellowstone National Park and many surrounding towns have been inundated with record levels of rainfall and flooding, prompting officials to close all entrances to the park, which stretches across parts of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.\n\nThe Brittons said they were used to high water levels in the river at this time of year. But on Sunday night, something felt different. Their house was shaking.\n\n“At first, I thought that it might have just been the trees coming down the river, banging into each other,” Victoria said, “but it was shaking the house, which was very strange.”\n\nIt wasn’t until the next morning that Victoria realized what was going on: “It was actually the embankment crumbling, and that’s why the house was rumbling and shaking,” she said.\n\nOn Monday, the couple sat nearby and watched their house fall into the river.\n\n“It was a long drawn out (process),” said TJ. “My canoe, my boat fell in. Part of the garage was hanging out. The concrete pad in front of the house was gone. And then the garage fell off. The decks fell off. And the house eventually.”\n\nTJ told CNN he didn’t see his house enter the river, as he’d been picking up some supplies at a friend’s house when it happened. They started driving back upon hearing the news; when they got to the highway, they noticed a crowd had gathered near the guardrail, so they pulled over to see what was happening.\n\n“And right around the corner of the river came my house,” TJ said. “That was the weirdest thing I ever saw in my life.”\n\nTJ says he and Victoria are both still in shock and “trying to numb ourselves to the whole thing, but the reality is going to hit here pretty soon.”\n\nThe couple says a majority of people they’ve encountered have been very supportive, but there was one group of tourists who were “applauding and cheering when our house was floating down the river.”\n\n“That was frustrating,” Victoria told CNN. “We heard a few people have some uncompassionate, unsympathetic things to say as we’re sitting there just waiting for our whole entire life to fall into the river.”\n\nHistoric rainfall and flooding\n\nIn a three-day period last week, Yellowstone National Park received about two to three times the typical rainfall for the month of June, and precipitation this month has already been more than 400% of the average across northwestern Wyoming and southern Montana, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAccording to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Yellowstone River at one point swelled to its highest level in more than 100 years.\n\nParts of Yellowstone National Park could reopen as early as Monday, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. But officials have said the northern section of the park will likely remain closed through remainder of the season.\n\n“Many sections of road in (the park’s northern areas) are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct,” according to a June 14 news release. “It is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.”\n\nNeighboring towns feeling the impact\n\nGardiner, Montana, where the Brittons live, is near Yellowstone’s northern entrance, and hotel owners say they are feeling the impact of park’s closure.\n\n“It’s a Yellowstone town, and it lives and dies by tourism,” said Park County Commissioner Bill Berg.\n\n“There’s nobody here,” Kari Huesing, office manager of Yellowstone Gateway Inn, told CNN. “We were booked solid for a year.”\n\nNow, she says, all but one of her visitors are gone following the flooding. One neighboring hotel has shut down and sent its employees home.\n\nThe dangerous flooding, fueled by heavy rainfall and snowmelt, began to inundate the park and surrounding areas Monday, overtaking essential roadways and bridges and surrounding some communities.\n\nIn Montana’s Park County, which includes Gardiner, water had been receding and access to some communities was restored, Greg Coleman, the county’s emergency services manager, said on Wednesday.\n\nBut the area will see the warmest temperatures of the season Friday and Saturday, which will increase snowmelt in the mountains and produce another increase of water flows into area waterways, CNN meteorologists said Friday morning. Many waterways could reach their banks by Saturday or Sunday, and minor flooding is possible – but it is not expected to compare to the levels reached earlier this week.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled Kari Huesing's first name and incorrectly identified her position at the Yellowstone Gateway Inn.

Clashes among their supporters have left many voters feeling fearful of what is yet to come.\n\nThe race could be a close one. Neither gained over 50% in a first round vote earlier this month, forcing the two leading candidates into this Sunday’s run-off vote.\n\nThe candidates\n\nLula da Silva was president for two terms, from 2003 to 2006 and 2007 to 2011, where he led the country through a commodities boom that helped fund huge social welfare programs and lifted millions out of poverty.\n\nThe charismatic politician is known for his dramatic backstory: He didn’t learn to read until he was 10, left school after fifth grade to work full-time, and went on to lead worker strikes which defied the military regime in 1970s. He co-founded the Workers’ Party (PT), that became Brazil’s main left-wing political force.\n\nLula da Silva left office with a 90% approval rating – a record tarnished however by Brazil’s largest corruption probe, dubbed “Operation Car Wash,” which led to charges against hundreds of high-ranking politicians and businesspeople across Latin America. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, but a court threw out his conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for his political rebound “in a plot twist worthy of one of the Brazilian beloved telenovelas,” Bruna Santos, a senior advisor at the Wilson Institute’s Brazil Center, told CNN.\n\nBrazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who is running for a second term, smiles during a campaign rally in Guarulhos, the great Sao Paulo area, on October 22, 2022. Andre Penner/AP\n\nHis rival, Bolsonaro, is a former army captain who was a federal deputy for 27 years. Bolsonaro was considered a marginal figure in politics during much of this time before emerging in the mid-2010s as the figurehead of a more radically right-wing movement, which perceived the PT as its main enemy.\n\nHe ran for President in 2018 with the conservative Liberal Party, campaigning as a political outsider and anti-corruption candidate, and gaining the moniker ‘Trump of the Tropics.’ A divisive figure, Bolsonaro has become known for his bombastic statements and conservative agenda, which is supported by important evangelical leaders in the country.\n\nBut poverty has grown during his time as President, and his popularity levels took a hit over his handling of the pandemic, which he dismissed as the “little flu,” before the virus killed more than 680,000 people in the country.\n\nBolsonaro’s government has become known for its support of ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists have warned that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nWhat are their platforms?\n\nThe race is a tight one for the two household names who espouse radically different paths to prosperity.\n\nBolsonaro’s campaign is a continuation of his conservative, pro-business agenda. Bolsonaro has promised to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. But he has also has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (roughly US$110) monthly benefit for low-income households known as Auxilio Brasil, without clearly defining how it will be paid for.\n\nBolsonaro accelerated those financial aid payments this month, a move seen by critics as politically motivated. “As the election loomed, his government has made direct payments to working-class and poor voters – in a classic populist move,” Santos told CNN.\n\nBolsonaro’s socially conservative messaging, which includes railing against political correctness and promotion of traditional gender roles, has effectively rallied his base of Brazilian conservative voters, she also said.\n\nLula co-founded the Workers' Party (PT), that became Brazil's main left-wing political force. Andre Penner/AP\n\nLula da Silva’s policy agenda has been light on the details, focusing largely on promises to improve Brazilians fortunes based on past achievements, say analysts.\n\nHe wants to put the state back at the heart of economic policy making and government spending, promising a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula da Silva also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nBut Santos warns that he’ll face an uphill battle: “With a fragile fiscal scenario (in Brazil) and little power over the budget, it won’t be easy.”\n\nLula da Silva faces a hostile congress if he becomes president. Congressional elections on October 3 gave Bolsonaro’s allies the most seats in both houses: Bolsonaro’s right-wing Liberal Party increased its seats to 99 in the lower house, and parties allied with him now control half the chamber, Reuters reports.\n\n“Lula seems to ignore the necessary search for new engines of growth because the state cannot grow more,” she said.\n\nWhat will happen on Election Day?\n\nA Datafolha poll released last Wednesday showed 49% of respondents said they would vote for Lula da Silva and 45% would go for Bolsonaro, who gained a percentage point from a poll by the same institute a week ago.\n\nBut Bolsonaro fared better than expected in the October 2 first round vote, denying Lula da Silva the outright majority which polls had predicted. The incumbent’s outperformance of the polls in the first round suggests wider support for Bolsonaro’s populist brand of conservatism, and analysts expect the difference in Sunday’s vote to be much tighter than expected.\n\nThere could be any number of other surprises. Fears of violence have haunted this election, with several violent and sometimes fatal clashes between Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva supporters recorded in recent months. From the start of this year until the first round of voting, the US non-profit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) recorded “36 instances of political violence involving party representatives and supporters across the country,” that suggests “even greater tensions and polarization than recorded in the previous general elections.”\n\nCritics also fear Bolsonaro has been laying the groundwork to contest the election. Though he insists he will respect the results if they are “clean and transparent,” Bolsonaro has repeatedly claimed that Brazil’s electronic ballot system is susceptible to fraud – an entirely unfounded allegation that has drawn comparisons to the false election claims of former US President Donald Trump. There is no record of fraud in Brazilian electronic ballots since they began in 1996, and experts are worried the rhetoric will lead to outbreaks of violence if Lula da Silva wins.\n\n“In this consequential election, the confidence we have in the strength of Brazilian democratic institutions is going to be challenged,” Santos said.", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}]}

Rhoden dropped her daughter off on Friday, April 15, 2016.\n\nHe cocked his head and leaned in from the edge of the funeral home’s couch, when they asked what he needed.\n\nThose who came to call couldn’t imagine losing a member of their family, let alone eight — all at the same time, in a murderous massacre in the stillness of the night.\n\n“Whatchya’ mean?” asked Leonard Manley, looking out over the crowded parlor the day before he would bury a daughter, a son-in-law and three grandchildren and three shirt-tail relatives.\n\nHe opened his arms wide as if to offer an embrace: “My friends are here. My family is all here.\n\n“What else could a man need?’’\n\nSorrow visits the foothills of Appalachia as sure as its seasons and its next generations. But this is different.\n\nThese unwelcome visitors likely knew the family they slaughtered, some as they slept, in their homes, on family land.\n\nDeath and family brought the Rhodens to Ohio generations ago.\n\nNow it holds them here.\n\nThe canary yellow paint is faded and peeling on the house set a bit back from Union Hill Road. But its roof is sturdy, made of metal. Its foundation, rows of cinderblock.\n\nSheets of particle board cover what used to be windows. Only one is grayed; the rest remain the burnished tan of newness. Not enough seasons have passed to weather them.\n\nThe boards are nailed in place to keep the strangers out — in case gawkers don’t heed the No Trespass signs affixed to the front of the home and to the trunks of greening trees surrounding it. A lone remnant of crime scene tape flaps in the warmth of an early summer breeze.\n\nIf not for those less-than-subtle warnings, the little yellow house could pass for any other in the gentle rolling hills of rural Pike County, Ohio. Junked cars and broken-down appliances litter the yard. A deserted swingset rusts nearby. A picnic table sits, abandoned.\n\nFor Tony Rhoden, this is what’s left of his family homestead, a testament to a lifetime of hardship and heartbreak. It symbolizes all the homes and the properties where his dad Clarence Rhoden planted apple, peach and pear trees and sowed crops each spring to feed his family when the asphalt company layoff came before Thanksgiving, as it did every year. Where he and his brothers hunted squirrel, rabbit and deer. Where they, too, taught their sons to kill not for sport, but for survival.\n\nAfter Clarence died, there was no reason for Tony to return to the yellow house. His younger brother, Kenneth, moved in. And his baby brother, Chris, was raising his family just down the road in his own trailer on the same property.\n\nThey tended to it. They kept it safe.\n\nUntil April 22.\n\n*****\n\nNo one seems to know yet who crept onto the Rhoden properties to kill Tony’s younger brothers, a sister-in-law, a cousin, two nephews, a niece, and a soon-to-be-niece who never saw the wedding that would have officially made her a Rhoden. The killers took much of the evidence, but they left behind the family’s next generation — a toddler and two babies — physically unharmed.\n\nTony doesn’t have a theory about who would kill his relatives. Nor does he know why. He can’t fathom that hate.\n\nInvestigators discovered hundreds of marijuana plants at the crime scenes, and evidence of three commercial grow operations at two of the sites. They have never elaborated, nor confirmed if marijuana was a motive for the massacre. They haven’t said much about the mass killing, which remains unsolved.\n\nIt was 26 days before authorities released the land back to the family.\n\nThe crime scenes — three trailers and a camper — were towed away.\n\nKept safe, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said, for that hopeful someday when a judge or jurors might need to see them to help convict the killers.\n\nTony and his sole surviving brother, Brady, spent that spring weekend mowing, weed-whacking and trimming trees on the five-acre property his dad and mom bought 25 years before. They repeated the process just down the road on the six acres Chris Rhoden had bought his ex-wife, Dana, just a month before their family was killed.\n\nHe’s not sure what might happen to the land and, in this moment, it does not matter.\n\n“I have the satisfaction of saying: ‘Chris, I took care of that for you,” said Tony, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses. “He would’ve done it for me.”\n\nIt was a 14-hour job that sweltering Sunday.\n\nDuring those first few weeks, Tony, Brady or Brady’s boys would return often to mow, to feed and water the 350-to 400-pound hog, the dozens of chickens and the 15 dogs the killers spared.\n\nAs spring turned to summer, the mowing trips dropped to weekly. The animals were sold. Relatives took the dogs.\n\nBrady still drives by daily. Tony, not quite so often. But enough.\n\n“Sometimes I catch myself driving up to Union Hill to sit at dad’s place,” Tony said, looking out into the distance. “I drive out there and think … just sit at the picnic table and think.”\n\nIt is not a place of comfort.\n\n“It’s hard to go back,” he said.\n\n“Nothing eases the pain.\n\n“I don’t reckon anything will.”\n\nThere was never a doubt back in the early 1960s that Geneva Stone Rhoden would raise eight of her nine siblings left orphaned after her mother died — nearly a year to the day after a logging accident killed her father.\n\nGeneva had been married just two years to Clarence and was living in Kentucky when the call came.\n\nThe young couple loaded up their two young children and headed for her parents’ home across the river in Ohio.\n\nShe was barely 19. He was just 23.\n\nGeneva Rhoden fought for and won custody of her school-aged younger siblings, Tony said.\n\n“She cared so much, she wanted to keep them together as a family,” he said.\n\nThrough the years, Geneva and Clarence, who worked in sawmills as a young man, moved from house to house, and from southern Ohio county to southern Ohio county.\n\nThen they bought that little yellow house and settled in Pike County.\n\nAll the while, they were having babies of their own. One about every 18 to 24 months.\n\n“As one was coming around, another was going out,” Tony recalled of his aunts and sisters, uncles and brothers.\n\nBetween their nine children and Geneva Rhoden’s siblings, the couple would raise 17 children through a 35-year marriage filled with deep love, marred by deeper loss.\n\nThe Stone and Rhoden families grew up together. They shared bedrooms with bunk beds and kitchens with never enough chairs for family meals.\n\n“I was 17 before we ever had running water in the house. Se-VEN-teen,” said Tony, now 48. “We had wells and an outhouse.\n\n“You’d draw your water to bathe in. You’d draw your water for laundry. You’d draw your water for everything,” he said. “Mom would do laundry: She’d do everyone’s laundry for the week and then do dad’s on the weekends, his work clothes.\n\nAll of the children pitched in.\n\n“It was part of life, you know?”\n\n*****\n\nWhile Geneva the matriarch cooked and laundered for the family, Clarence worked his Columbus job at an asphalt paving company during the weekdays and gardened on the weekends. Gardening was both necessity and passion, something he learned as a boy from his father and one some of the children picked up, as well.\n\nHe relied on his hands, because he couldn’t read or write.\n\nFamily lore has it that Clarence attended school for just one day. The story goes that he came home from school and told his dad he didn’t care much for it, said Kenneth Rhoden’s ex-wife Stacie Rigsby, who has done extensive genealogy research on the family.\n\nCourt records paint a bleaker picture.\n\nClarence grew up poor, one of eight children and the son of a railroad worker, who sometimes meted out harsh discipline.\n\nHe “never had the opportunity to receive an education because his father forbade him from going to school, and forced him to stay home and work on a cattle farm,” according to Pike County court records related to a felony conviction against Clarence that came years later.\n\nAs an adult, Clarence was particular about his fruit and vegetable gardens. He knew the bounty would have to feed a least a dozen mouths during the winter months after the annual layoffs arrived at Strawser’s Paving in Columbus.\n\nHis job wouldn’t start back up until April.\n\n“Believe me, we ate many beans and potatoes,” Tony said. “Sometimes that’s all we could afford.\n\n“But we never, ever, ever went hungry. Never.”\n\nChristmas meant presents; gifts that had been dutifully paid for on layaway accounts for months. Birthdays always brought family parties.\n\n“Mom made sure each one of us had a cake,” Tony said. “It might not have had all the candles, but we had cake.”\n\nAs sure as the fruit trees set their blossoms, the Rhoden kids helped their dad plant and tend to his half-acre garden every spring.\n\n“Summer times, he would come home on the weekends and what we was supposed to have gotten done out there, he would go out and mend it the way he wanted it done,’’ Tony said, flashing a rare grin.\n\nFor family barbeques, they would slaughter the chickens the children helped raise.\n\nThe kids would play basketball with a hoop fashioned from a 20-inch bicycle rim attached to an old pole one of the kids found somewhere.\n\nAnd of course, those hot months also meant swimming and fishing in a nearby creek — an idyllic setting amid a beautiful countryside.\n\n*****\n\nOne Saturday in the spring of 1984, Steven Rhoden, the little brother with whom Tony shared secrets and a room, went missing.\n\nThe sheriff assembled a search party. But as darkness set in, no one could find the green-eyed 14-year-old with sandy-blonde hair.\n\nTony can’t recall who told him that Steven’s 73-pound body was found in the creek the following day. He was told his little brother had slipped while setting a minnow trap. Steven hit his head and drowned.\n\nThe coroner’s report lists the day he was found as his day of death: May 13, 1984.\n\nMother’s Day.\n\nThe next day was Geneva Rhoden’s 41st birthday.\n\nThe family buried Steven in the Rhoden family cemetery, in Greenup County, Kentucky. Relatives still decorate his grave.\n\n“It seems so long ago now,” Tony said, his words catching in his throat. “It was a tough time for a long time.\n\n“Still is to this day.”\n\n“You ask that question: Why?’’ he went on. “It’s just an accident you can never understand.”\n\n“Just like this,’’ Tony said, referencing the April killings.\n\n“It’s something that never should have happened.”\n\nTony and most of his siblings had moved out and started their own families by January 1991, when his parents bought that little yellow house on Union Hill Road.\n\nThe decade that followed brought more pain to the Rhodens, first in the form of hastily recanted allegations of sexual assault against Clarence in 1991.\n\nTo this day, some familiar with those charges remain skeptical, first made by a teenage girl who quickly said she made them up. But four years later, she leveled the same charges in court. She was an adult by then. She is not identified because The Enquirer does not name victims of sexual assault.\n\nIn the interim, Geneva had separated from her husband and left the house. But she didn’t go far; she stayed on the land living in a camper.\n\nClarence would be indicted, tried and convicted in a one-day trial 21 years ago on five counts of sexual battery.\n\nEight days later, his divorce from Geneva was finalized.\n\nClarence filed appeals to overturn the conviction. He lost and was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison.\n\nThrough the years, neighbors, several of the Rhoden children and even the assault victim asked the court to consider releasing him early from Orient prison, court records show. Prison was worsening his hypertension and heart issues, their letters noted. His children wrote they feared he might die behind bars.\n\nThe mostly handwritten notes, all photocopied and tucked neatly in the court file, depict a hard-working man who rarely missed a day of work, a father who provided for his family and a neighbor who often shared a cup of coffee and a hand of rummy 500.\n\n“Should he die while still incarcerated I believe that we would be unable to resolve our differences and have some sort of relationship,” the victim wrote the judge in 2002.\n\n“This matter,” her letter continued, “has divided a very close family. And I desire (that) family to be reunited again.”\n\nIt may have divided family members, but it did not break them.\n\nIn the end, Clarence spent four years in prison while his little yellow house stood empty. He would return there and live until a heart attack killed him six years later in the summer of 2008.\n\nHis family buried him next to his son, Steven, in the Rhoden family cemetery.\n\nIn history and heartache, the Rhodens are not unlike countless generations of families who call this southern swath of Ohio home. They settled in scenic plots of fertile ground where flatlands give rise to the forested foothills of Appalachia, about 90 minutes east of the river city of Cincinnati and 60 miles south of the capital city of Columbus.\n\nFor the Rhodens and their neighbors, Appalachia is more than simple geography defined by receding glaciers millions of years ago. Appalachia is a culture rooted in hard work and hard living, in family privacy and family grudges, in distrust of strangers and abundant generosity.\n\nIt’s a place that makes time for long conversations, where time seems to pass more slowly. A place where Sunday dinner still means the meal served around 2 p.m. And where asking questions equates to prying into the business of others.\n\n“We were a family that kept to ourselves,” Tony said. “That’s just how we are.”\n\nThat sense of privacy, of self-sufficiency, comes honestly to many here, after decades of being left behind by employers in one of the state’s poorest and undereducated counties. Nearly a quarter of its residents live below the poverty line compared to 15.9 percent statewide.\n\nThis is a place where the promise of jobs that an atomic plant brought back in the 1950s withered away, like so much other skilled labor work through the decades. And skilled labor is a lifeline when one-fifth of Pike County residents don’t hold a high school diploma or GED and just 11 percent hold bachelor’s or advanced degrees.\n\n“It’s like they just forgot us down here,” Tony said.\n\nThat has left folks to rely heavily on those they trust to stitch together a patchwork of jobs largely learned and passed down through generations: They tend crops, cut trees, work at mills, fix cars and other machinery. Many often trade for goods and services when money runs low.\n\nSome struggle mightily with drugs and alcohol abuse. Others rely on public assistance, while still others turn to illegal activities to try and make ends meet.\n\nFor even more, living at home in Pike County — where a quarter of its housing units are heated by wood and 6 percent have no indoor plumbing — means commuting an hour or longer to nearby cities for decent-paying jobs.\n\nTony tried making the trek to Columbus — like his dad did for more than three decades before and like his brother Kenneth had recently started doing.\n\n“I didn’t care for it,” he said. “The drive. And the people, well they were different.\n\n“And,” he added after a momentary pause. “This is home.”\n\n*****\n\nIt was Tony’s brother, Chris, who stayed on the family property. He lived in a trailer within spitting distance of his dad’s house, with wife Dana on Union Hill Road. They raised their children — Clarence “Frankie,” Hanna, and Chris, Jr. — there. Chris. Sr., and Dana eventually went their separate ways. In recent years, however, their kids were beginning to raise their children there, too.\n\nIt was Chris, as well, who took on the job of overseeing his dad’s estate, which ended up being worth about $50,000 — almost all of that tied to the land on Union Hill Road and another 47 acres less than four miles away on Left Fork Road.\n\nChris Rhoden paid the funeral bill and he paid off his dad’s debts. He and his siblings each shared one-eighth interest in the land, but later, his sisters relinquished their share to the brothers, according to Pike County probate and property records.\n\nIt was not a lot in cash. Its fortune was in memories.\n\nMost of the family remained close, connected by blood and history and a deep-seated loyalty that seemed unshakable. Sisters and brothers, cousins and aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews routinely dropped by each other’s homes often and unannounced.\n\nIt was common for the men and boys to work on demolition derby cars, while the women cooked large meals inside for everyone. They lent each other money, shared in their devotion to children and child-rearing and rarely could stay angry with each other for long.\n\nEven in divorce, there was little acrimony.\n\n“Once a Rhoden, always a Rhoden,” said Kenneth’s former wife, Stacie Rigsby. “I don’t know why that is, really. We all was just so tight.”\n\nThe pair had worked at reconciling, but it never worked, she said.\n\nBut for Chris and Dana, getting back together seemed to be their logical next step. They had always loved each other, after all, family members said.\n\nChris bought her the trailer about a mile down from his home. And once their youngest son graduated from high school, they planned to remarry, said her dad, Leonard Manley.\n\nDana was proud of the new home, which sat between Chris’ trailer and her parents’ trailer on Union Hill Road. She posted photographs of the home she had made for her and her children on social media accounts.\n\nLaughter and love filled the home during a baby shower she hosted April 9 for her only daughter and her soon-to-be born granddaughter, Kylie\n\nLess than a month later, it would be one of four crime scenes. And baby Kylie, just 5 days old, would be in foster care -- far way from any family.\n\n*****\n\nThe Rhoden men were known as hard workers who rarely if ever complained. The family women as caregivers to their children and also to those who had less.\n\nTony, Chris and Kenneth, and other Rhoden relatives, worked together for years as laborers for long-time family friend Robin Waddell. A decade ago, the men cleared 100 acres of woods, ran electricity and put in the roads to create what is now the idyllic Big Bear Lake Family Resort and Campground on the edge of Scioto County in Lucasville. The overnight campground is a home-away-from-home retreat for hundreds of regulars who park their campers there seasonally. Some make it home, year-round.\n\n“Nobody worked harder than them boys,” Waddell said, showing off the elaborate decks and playgrounds Chris Rhoden built over the years.\n\n“You can’t look anywhere here and not see Chris,” he added.\n\nDana had recently started using her social media accounts to help sell salvaged cars for the Scioto River Trading Company, near the campground, said her dad Leonard Manley.\n\nChris and Kenneth would frequently buy cars at auction, fix them and turn around and sell them or useable parts to turn a small profit.\n\nThe car business was what Dana and Chris did on the side for a little extra cash, Manley said. It wasn't a lot. But, here, everything helped.\n\nShe worked full-time as a nursing assistant at the Hillside Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Peebles, 10 miles west of her home. She loved the work, often taking food and small gifts to patients and staff.\n\nBut pay in that field is barely above minimum wage.\n\n*****\n\nKenneth Rhoden also worked alongside his brothers and tinkered with cars and building demolition derby cars.\n\nGetting by for him sometimes meant growing marijuana on that family land on Left Fork Road where he lived in a camper, said his daughter and namesake Kendra Rhoden.\n\nLike his dad, Kenneth was gifted at gardening and turned to growing and cultivating marijuana to supplement his income and to help her mom, also a nurse’s aide, in lean times.\n\nThe 19-year-old never knew him to be involved in large-scale distribution, she said.\n\nKendra is now the executor to his estate. She said there really isn’t much to it: His camper, a truck and his beloved motorcycle. There are no secret bank accounts, no piles of cash, she said.\n\nKenneth lived down the road from oldest brother Brady, who still lives on the 47-acre tract.\n\nIt’s just a few miles and a short drive to Union Hill Road, where Chris and Dana and their kids lived.\n\nHe lived alone with Brownie, a pit bull-terrier mix, and had recently gone to work for U.S. Utilities in Columbus.\n\n“My dad was the kind of person who always gave life lessons,’’ Kendra said. “He would say that even in the darkest hour would come light.\n\n“He would always say to live every day like it was your last.”\n\nKendra Rhoden said nothing seemed amiss with her dad or other family members in the days leading up to April 22.\n\nJust like many nights, Kendra was going to spend the night with her cousin Hanna and Hanna’s 5-day-old baby girl Kylie the night of April 21. But Kendra needed the cash a last-minute, overnight babysitting job would bring. So she said she’d see Hanna — who was like an inseparable sister to her – the next day.\n\nHanna, 19, had packed up her older daughter, Sophia Wagner, and dropped her off at her father's home on Friday April 15. She presumably snuggled in with her newborn she’d been faithfully nursing that week. Her brother, Chris Jr., 16, was also likely home when their mom arrived home after pulling a double shift at the nursing home because he had school the next day.\n\nDown the road, Chris Sr. and Tony talked by phone about getting a part to fix Dana’s faucet. The conversation was brief. Neither a man of many words. They signed off, saying they would see each other the next day at work at Big Bear.\n\nTheir cousin, Gary, had been living and working alongside Chris Sr. for several months. Chris Sr. had worked to get Gary off of drugs and alcohol and had helped him repeatedly to stay clean and sober, said Gary’s stepmother, Ruth Rhoden.\n\n“Chris got him off of all that stuff,” she said, adding that Gary often worked with Chris Sr. at Big Bear Lake.\n\nThat meant that paydays would come and Chris would hold back most of Gary’s pay to ensure he wouldn’t spend it on drugs. Instead of giving him the money, he would go shopping or run errands with his cousin.\n\n“He was really, really good to Gary,” she said.\n\nThe two had worked together at the lake, putting on some finishing touches on a wooden playground near the entrance of the camping area.\n\nChris and Dana’ oldest son, Clarence “Frankie” Rhoden, 20, was living in a trailer with his fiancée, Hannah Gilley, 20, and their 6-month-old son, Ruger.\n\nHannah never learned how to drive, so she was often stuck on Union Hill Road until or unless someone came to pick her up. On April 21, her sister Meranda had packed a bag to spend the night after she finished her job at a local pizza parlor, said their grandfather Kenny Shoemaker.\n\nBut for whatever reason, Meranda drove past Union Hill Road that night.\n\nShe headed home and slept in her own bed.\n\n*****\n\nIn the early morning hours of April 22, the killers entered the trailers on Union Hill Road and Left Fork Road. They fired a total of 32 bullets into the eight victims.\n\nThey killed Hanna, even as her newborn girl snuggled alongside her, in her mother’s new trailer. Dana was shot five times; her little brother was shot multiple times, too.\n\nThey shot both Frankie and Hannah Gilley, as their toddler slept between them and as Frankie’s now 4-year-old son, Brentley, was in another room.\n\nChris Sr. was shot nine times. It appeared, family members said officials have told them, he may have struggled with his attackers. His cousin, Gary, was found shot multiple times in a back bedroom. The men were found lying on the floor near each other.\n\nKenneth was the only victim shot once. He was shot in the eye. He, too, was found in his bed. His home was the only left unlocked.\n\nNone of the dogs at any of the properties were hurt. Surveillance equipment and cameras were taken from the properties, family members said. It’s unclear if anything else was taken from inside the homes.\n\nAttorney General DeWine has said since the first press conference that the investigation would not be easy. It has turned into the most complex and largest in Ohio’s history.\n\nEarlier this month, he said authorities have gathered the evidence necessary to prosecute the killers. He said he and investigators have learned a lot about Pike County in the last six months of the probe. And, he has said repeatedly, he is sure folks here know more than they are saying.\n\nAll that aside, DeWine, continues to promise the killers will be caught.\n\nThe Rhodens and their extended family aren’t so sure.\n\nAnd even if they catch the killers, Tony can't help to wonder:\n\nWill it really matter?\n\nTony steeled himself as he stood outside that little yellow house back in the summer. He hadn’t stepped foot inside since his dad Clarence died eight years before.\n\nHe went in search of a piece of his family’s heritage, for something to hold onto.\n\nHe inhaled deeply and walked up to the house, its paint peeling more than he remembered. He looked at the particle board.\n\nPatient and strong and alone, he methodically worked the nails out of the board and lifted it just enough to slip inside.\n\nHe walked across the threshold.\n\nNot much had changed. There were Kenneth’s things, left after he moved out and into his own place on Left Folk Road. A few of his dad’s were there, too.\n\nBut he couldn’t find that one thing he came seeking: The white leather-bound family Bible, with photos of happier times stuffed between its pages; and maybe family birthdates and other notes scribbled just inside its cover.\n\nIt didn’t take him long to check the rooms before he knew it wasn’t there. It’s most likely in one of those trailers the authorities towed away.\n\nAt least he hopes it is.\n\nHe fastened the board back in place, brushed the dust and cobwebs off his shirt and headed back down Union Hill Road leaving as he had come.\n\nEmpty handed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/indianapolis/2022/06/27/indystars-317-project-stories-all-indianapolis-neighborhoods/7704062001/", "title": "IndyStar's 317 Project: Stories of all of Indianapolis' neighborhoods", "text": "In October 2021, we introduced you to IndyStar's 317 Project.

Their toolbox sits nearby. They’ve spent hours at the yard, but for regulars at the Pull-A-Part in Martindale-Brightwood, the end result is worth it.\n\nEvery day, customers take their pick of car parts among the sea of automobiles — however obscure. The only catch: They need to remove the pieces themselves. Two dollars is all one needs to get into the yard. For those who find what they want, they’ll pay a reasonable price versus what they’d pay for a new part.\n\nPrindell Young said that’s part of the appeal. But mostly, he enjoys the do-it-yourself spirit.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTha Corn Man fires up Mexican street corn in Fall Creek Place food truck\n\nShrouded in charcoal smoke in a Dollar General lot, Timmy Campbell is trying to start his generator.\n\nThe Houston native is, to his loyal customers in Fall Creek Place, just Tha Corn Man. “Hey Corn Man!” they’d call out. His food truck’s front plate reads: Corny. He calls his 10-year-old daughter “the Corn Cob Kid.”\n\nThe love for elotes sprung from his Texas childhood, when Mexican street corn was abundant at food trucks. Then came the Gary of his teens, when Campbell would wake up to the corn man’s bell ringing down the street.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHe'd fish in the Amazon if he could, but this Crossfield pond has something more unique\n\nThe pond is still, and green. The grass around it has been tamed by mowers. It's guarded by tract homes on one side and a 2-way road on the other. No towering forests, or White River-like currents.\n\nBut the fishing is decent, and that’s enough. Soon, when the weather warms, the young fishers of Crossfield will bike out here with their poles and toss lines into the water.\n\n“It’s run by the kids around here,” Matthew Danz, 19, says, as he watches his bobber – a dot asleep on the surface. Waiting for it to talk to him.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIndy's Irish Ink, where art meets pain therapy\n\nHannah McKenry has a good feeling about turning 27. It's a year for change.\n\n\"It's a pandemic thing — I completely lost my mid-20s. It feels like I jumped from my early to my late,\" she said. \"And I feel really ready to change my life.\"\n\nShe decided to mark that milestone with a tattoo, specifically a birthday cake featured on an album by American dream pop duo Beach House.\n\nAs it works out, her tattoo artist and friend, Kay Robertson, was free at Irish Ink Tattoo and Piercing in the Perry Meridian neighborhood of Indianapolis' south side. Even as other tattoo shops opened and closed, the tattoo parlor on Meridian Street stuck around.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSkate park in Stout Field fills niche in city's skateboarding community\n\nTucked inside an unassuming warehouse in Stout Field, you'll find the city's only indoor skate park.\n\nQ Skatepark, 1727 Stout Field East Drive, provides a weatherproof haven for first-time skateboarders and experienced riders alike. The cavernous space with its graffitied walls has even hosted skateboarding icon Tony Hawk and rapper Lil Wayne.\n\nBryan and Shane Apolskis opened the park in 2016. The same warehouse also serves as headquarters for their event management business, Sequence, which puts on the city's St. Patrick's Day parade.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNora restaurant offers slice of Burmese history, and cuisine\n\nStep into Htaw Metta on a busy weekend afternoon and you might hear five different languages in the cozy Nora restaurant; patrons chatter in Burmese, Karen, Thai, or English and in the kitchen, Mon, another Burmese language.\n\nThe language mélange reflects both the eatery’s cuisine ‒ a mix of sushi, Thai, and Burmese offerings ‒ and the owner’s life story.\n\nBorn in then-Burma, now Myanmar, near the Thai border, Htira Rammahtaw belongs to the Mon people, one of Myanmor’s many ethnic groups. As a young man he moved to Thailand but his people were subject to persecution there.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWanamaker Feed & Seed owner has front row view of 'Small Town, USA'\n\nAt Wanamaker Feed & Seed, Jim Trimble has sold customer service for 45 years.\n\nDown the street from the neighborhood church and across from the local fish fry spot, Trimble’s customers visit for more than just hardware, pet supplies or poultry feed.\n\n“We don't sell anything you can’t get at some other store,” Trimble said. “We don't have the market cornered on anything, so we try to know what we are selling and pass the knowledge along.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn Crispus Attucks Museum, Black voices share Black History loud and clear\n\nYou couldn't hear much inside Crispus Attucks Museum. Not on a late Tuesday afternoon, even as boisterous students attending Crispus Attucks High School filtered out of yellow buses under cold and cloudy skies.\n\nThe museum, 1140 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St., shares a common wall with the school's gymnasium. But for the sharp squeak of tennis shoes, the occasional tweet of a coach's whistle and faint shouts from boys playing basketball, all was peaceful and quiet.\n\nRead more here.\n\nBuddhist temple and sculpture garden call Indianapolis east side community home\n\nIt's tucked away so that most passersby wouldn't even know it's there. But on South Franklin Road in Indianapolis' Raymond Park neighborhood, hidden behind a house, is a Buddhist temple and sculpture garden.\n\nThe Phap An Temple made the eastside community home a few years ago. When they bought the football-field-sized lot, it was overgrown and full of brush, said Deborah Nguyen, a Temple member. But members worked to clear it out and turn it into something special.\n\nRead more here.\n\nLantern Hills church combines outreach and nature to serve its community\n\nA church located on about 3.3 acres of mostly woodsy land in Lantern Hills is an oasis of hope and help for its congregation and east-side neighbors.\n\nThe Church of the Nativity-Episcopal goes beyond traditional worship to be a community resource. On the second Saturday of each month, for instance, volunteers distribute free pet food to families in need ― a ministry started during the pandemic. And when unexpected life events arise, members step up to cook and deliver hot meals.\n\nRead more here.\n\n'Little winks from the universe' have shaped this bar in Twin Aire\n\nFinding used furniture in one’s preferred color palette might seem trifling. But not to Nicole Oesch ― not if you know the history of Kismetic, a bar and brewery she and husband Ryan own in Twin Aire.\n\nKismetic opened for business in April 2022. The name is a portmanteau of Kismet, or fate, and kinetic, the energy of movement. Destiny and motion.

Check out the videos.\n\nSnake photo gallery: Can you recognize these?\n\nSpring is here and snakes are on the move. Some people enjoy encounters with snakes while others would rather never see one at all, particularly near their home. A search on the internet will reveal products specifically formulated to repel snakes and there are plenty of home concoctions out there including placing mothballs around your house to keep snakes at bay. But don't be surprised if they don't work and you still find a snake slithering near your house.\n\nSubscriber exclusive:Want a hunting camp that's the envy of your friends? Here's what $13.9 million gets you\n\nSubscriber exclusive:Craving for a jumbo chili cheese dog or a burger like no other? Mamma's has you covered\n\nDo mothballs really keep snakes away?\n\n\"There's commercial snake repellents,\" said herpetologist Terry Vandeventer with the Living Reptile Museum. \"The No. 1 repellent in the South is mothballs.\n\n\"They absolutely don't work. I've tested them.\"\n\nIn one test Vandeventer placed mothballs on the ground. He then placed a cottonmouth snake on one side and a mouse on the other.\n\n\"He crawled over the mothballs and got the mouse,\" Vandeventer said. \"They simply don't work.\"\n\nSo, what can you do to keep snakes away from your home? Vandeventer said keeping all snakes away from your home is really not possible, but there are many steps that can be taken to make your lawn less attractive to snakes.\n\n'The unluckiest guy in America':Mississippi hunter bitten on head by copperhead in tree\n\nSimple steps help keep snakes out of your yard\n\n\"We know food attracts snakes,\" Vandeventer said. \"Since snakes eat rodents, we want to get rid of them. Get rid of the shelter and get rid of the food and they'll pass right by and go to your neighbor's ratty house.\"\n\nSo, how do you limit food sources and shelter for snakes? Here are some simple steps that will make your home unattractive to snakes.\n\n• Feed your pets inside. No, snakes don't like cat or dog food, but rodents do. Feed your pets inside and limit the food for rodents.\n\n• Get rid of debris and leaf piles. Piles of leaves and other lawn debris not only attract rodents, but they also provide protection for snakes, making them a great place for snakes to set up shop.\n\n• Keep your grass cut. This may seem basic, but tall grass provides cover for snakes. Keep it cut and not only is your lawn less desirable to snakes, you can more easily spot them. Your neighbors will appreciate it, too.\n\n• Beware of birdhouses. Everyone likes seeing birds and hearing their young chirp, but these can be an attractant for snakes. Some snakes such as the gray ratsnake are excellent climbers. The gray ratsnake is also one of the most common snakes in Mississippi. Placing a birdhouse on a fence or tree limb is the equivalent of sending a dinner invitation to a ratsnake. Instead, place birdhouses on a metal pole of a wooden post that is wrapped with metal sheeting or has a conical barrier in place.\n\n• Limit bird feeding. Backyard bird watching is a popular activity, but birds are messy. They often knock food from the feeder to the ground which attracts rodents. Consider limiting bird-feeding to colder months when food sources are limited and snakes are less active.\n\n• Burn your fire wood. There's nothing like a fire on a cool winter night, but that wood pile can become a problem when the outside temperatures begin to warm. A wood pile is a good place for snakes to hide, so burn your wood before snakes become active in spring. If you keep wood year-round, place it on a rack at least a foot above the ground.\n\n• Pick up fallen fruit. Fallen fruit is another food source for rodents and in turn can attract snakes.\n\n• Avoid mulch. Mulch can make your lawn look more attractive and not just to you and your neighbors. Mulch can become home for invertebrates that some species of snakes eat. It can also provide cover for snakes. So, if you don't want to encounter snakes, you may want to reconsider putting out mulch or pine straw.\n\n• Get rid of the garden pond. Garden ponds can be aesthetically pleasing, but they can also be a problem. Garden ponds can attract frogs and other animals which are food sources for snakes. Put fish in it and you've just added another attractant.\n\nRelated:Snakebites are painful and costly: How to avoid them and what to do, and not do, if you're bitten\n\nThe vast majority of snakes in Mississippi are harmless to humans and all, venomous or not, are beneficial. Because of that, Vandeventer said people shouldn't let their fear of snakes dictate their activities.\n\n\"Don't let the fear of this take away from doing everyday things and enjoying the outdoors,\" Vandeventer said. \"Just be mindful.\"\n\nRead More What you've heard about snakes may not be true\n\nContact Brian Broom at 601-961-7225 or bbroom@gannett.com.

Face coverings are recommended but not required in open-air spaces, the release said. However, the university requires masks in indoor spaces, so fans using elevators, premium indoor seating or transit buses will need to bring them. While some schools such as LSU are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for stadium entry, Auburn is not. Tiger Walk will be back, but the team’s pregame procession into the stadium will be shortened. The traditional pregame war eagle flight is also returning this year. The marching band will be allowed on the field for pregame and halftime festivities after being prohibited from the field last season. The university is encouraging fans to use digital ticketing through mobile devices. Merchandising and concessions inside Jordan-Hare will be cashless and contact-free, but game programs will still sell in and around the stadium for $10 cash.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Plastic is no longer a choice when checking out from stores in Anchorage. A ban on plastic bags is back in force in Alaska’s largest city after a temporary suspension during the pandemic, Alaska’s News Source reports. As of Wednesday, the option when checking out is paper or reusable options. The ban first took effect in 2019, but Assembly member Felix Rivera said it was relaxed during the pandemic in part because the supply chain for paper bags was disrupted. There were also concerns about whether reusable bags could transmit the coronavirus, he said. “I think since last year, we’ve learned a lot about the virus, and now nothing that I am reading leads me to have a lot of concern about reusable bags transmitting the virus,” he told the Anchorage television station.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a process that some people call a “virgin birth,” a Brazilian rainbow boa was born at the Phoenix Zoo with DNA from only one parent. Its mom, who has been at the zoo for 10 years, has never been paired for mating. Imagine the keepers’ surprise when the baby boa was discovered in the snake’s enclosure Aug. 3. The snake was likely born through parthenogenesis, in which one – or multiple – eggs mature without fertilization. The zoo believes this is the second documented birth of its kind among Brazilian rainbow boas. Mom is currently in the Boa Hut on the Forest of Uco Trail, and the zoo plans to house the baby in a reptile nursery on the Children’s Trail. So-called virgin births, or asexual reproduction, may not be that uncommon among vertebrates. Thelma, a reticulated python at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, gave birth to six baby pythons without a partner in 2014. “Once considered an evolutionary novelty, facultative parthenogenesis has now been documented in an increasing number of vertebrate species, ranging from the hammerhead shark to domestic turkeys, komodo dragons to snakes,” Warren Booth, an associate professor of molecular ecology at the University of Tulsa who studies the phenomenon, said in a statement in 2016.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several inmates say they weren’t told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used for that purpose. Three inmates at the Washington County jail said they didn’t know they were being given ivermectin until its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said it’s heard similar complaints from inmates. The inmates’ comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail’s physician that use of the drug was voluntary. “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for the virus. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients. Edrick Floreal-Wooten said he was given ivermectin after testing positive Aug. 21. “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” Floreal-Wooten said. He said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates. “Never. I’m not livestock,” he said. “I’m a human.” The ACLU said it has also heard from inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon force large department stores to display some child products in gender-neutral ways after the Legislature passed a bill Wednesday aimed at getting rid of traditional pink and blue marketing schemes for items like toys and toothbrushes. The bill would not outlaw boys and girls sections in department stores but would require retailers to have a gender-neutral section to display “a reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” It would only apply to department stores with 500 or more employees, so most small businesses would be exempt. It also wouldn’t apply to clothes, just toys and “childcare items,” which include hygiene and teething products. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly for a procedural vote before it heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. If it becomes law, California would become the first state to require these sections in stores, according to the office of Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, the bill’s author. He said the measure was inspired by a 10-year-old whose mother works in his legislative office. “Britten asked her mom while shopping why certain things in a store were ‘off limits’ to her because she was a girl but would be fine if she was a boy,” Low said. “Thankfully, my colleagues recognized the pure intentions of this bill and the need to let kids be kids.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three suburban police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter that provoked national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. The grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Phil Weiser are the latest chapter for the police department in the city of Aurora, which has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. McClain’s death helped inspire a sweeping police accountability law in Colorado, a ban on chokeholds and restrictions on the use of the sedative ketamine, both of which the indictment alleges contributed to his death. The charges were announced days after the second anniversary of when police stopped McClain on the street after a 911 caller reported a man who seemed “sketchy.” “What I set out to do is still not over, but I’m halfway there. I’m halfway there,” McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, said of her efforts to hold police accountable. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over last year and has pledged to work to restore public trust, said the department will continue to cooperate with the judicial process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: A small jet crashed shortly after taking off from a small airport Thursday morning, killing all four people aboard, officials said. The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the building has been accounted for, and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said. Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida overnight, officials said the city was seeing historic flooding Thursday. The Wilmington Fire Department and other agencies were performing water rescues, and many streets and bridges remained closed, officials said. Flooding affected several neighborhoods, and a Wilmington Fire Department spokesperson said crews had rescued 60 to 80 people by noon. Delaware Department of Transportation Community Relations Director CR McLeod said the flooding was affecting homes and businesses, and there were many vehicles underwater, WDEL-FM reports. More than 50 bridges would need to be surveyed and assessed, he said. “A lot of this water is coming down from Pennsylvania with the excessive amounts of rain that they had associated with the storm yesterday,” McLeod said. “All that water is going to make its way down toward the Delaware River, and it’s all coming down the Brandywine.” The Brandywine entered a major flood stage Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it reached a maximum crest of 23.1 feet, a new record, according to the National Weather Service. Waters began to recede, and the creek was expected to fall below flood stage early Friday, according to the agency.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital ranks last in the country for teacher pay compared to other jobs, WUSA-TV reports, citing a study from business.org. The July study compared the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers to the average salary for all jobs within each state and the district. The data was collected using the National Center for Education Statistics and compared with the salaries of all occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results found that D.C. and Virginia rank last in the country, with educators earning 17% and 10% less than the average wage, respectively. Virginia and D.C. are among seven states that the study claims pay teachers below the state’s average salary. The study reports that Mississippi has the lowest salary for teachers at just more than $45,000 per year, but that is still 8.6% higher than the average salary in the state. Pennsylvania ranked highest in the country, according to the study, with teachers earning 30% more than the average wage.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An elementary school was placed in a temporary, limited lockdown after a parent threatened to leave his job and confront an assistant principal for telling his children they couldn’t come to school without being masked. Christopher Kivlin was met by police officers Tuesday outside Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota. No charges were filed, but he was ordered not to come back to the school without calling first and getting permission. An incident report said Kivlin showed up to campus saying the school was violating the law by not allowing his children to attend school. The Sarasota County school district is among a dozen of Florida’s 67 districts, representing about half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students, that have defied Gov. Rob DeSantis’ executive order barring schools from requiring masks over parent objections. A judge last week ruled that DeSantis did not have the authority to issue the order. The DeSantis administration is expected to appeal the decision. Kivlin told television station WFLA he had no intention of hurting anyone but just wanted to talk to a school official. He apologized for scaring anyone and said that “it was just emotions built up.” “I found out after the fact that the school had to go into lockdown, I was like, ‘That’s horrible,’ ” Kivlin said. “I feel like I might have scared other parents.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge’s decision striking down a Trump-era rule that eliminated federal protections for some wetlands and streams is giving hope to opponents of a proposed mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge in southeast Georgia. A federal judge in Arizona on Monday tossed the rule that narrowed the types of U.S. waters that qualify for federal protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. The judge’s order, which applies nationwide, says the rule enacted under former President Donald Trump improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. One high-profile project directly affected by the environmental rollbacks under Trump was a proposal by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals to mine titanium dioxide on land about 3 miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge near the Georgia-Florida line. Conservationists fear mining close to the swamp’s edge could cause irreparable harm to the largest federal wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. Yet the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the project no longer required a federal permit because the rollbacks under Trump excluded wetlands on the site from federal protection. That left sole authority to Georgia state regulators to decide whether it could move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tourism officials have released a plan to reduce visitors on Oahu, the state’s most frequently visited and populous island. The plan was approved by the Hawaii Tourism Authority in July, and the full plan has now been released to the public, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Decreasing the total number of visitors to Oahu to a manageable level by controlling the number of visitor accommodations and exploring changes to land use, zoning and airport policies,” the plan says. It also establishes a regenerative tourism fee, creates reservation systems for natural and cultural sites, manages visitors’ use of cars, and promotes consumption of locally produced and sold goods. “We appreciate the Oahu residents who participated in the (plan) process and passionately contributed their diverse viewpoints, discussed various tourism-related challenges in their neighborhoods and helped set forth an actionable plan that is necessary for the community’s well-being,” said John De Fries, the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s president and CEO. “It’s about continued collaboration and moving forward together to malama (care for) this cherished place and each other, as desired by the people of Oahu.” The three-year plan was developed by community members and county officials in collaboration with the tourism authority.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: At least two state lawmakers received threatening letters concerning their votes on a law intended to drastically reduce wolf numbers. The anonymous letters to Republican Sen. Dan Johnson and Republican Rep. Caroline Troy say that “just as the wolf went from predator to prey, so shall you.” It’s not clear how many more lawmakers received the letters. The Lewiston Tribune reports some of the lawmakers contacted the Idaho State Police. Backers of the wolf law that took effect July 1 said the state can cut the number of wolves to 150 before federal authorities would take over management. That would be a 90% reduction of the state’s 1,500 wolves. The letters describe lawmakers as “nothing more than a sellout to the Cattle Association and that pitiful minority of cattle producers that seemingly dictate how our wildlife lives and dies.” Johnson said the envelope had a Sacramento postmark, and the return address was the Statehouse in Boise. “It’s OK for people to disagree with my votes or my bills, but some comments cross the line,” he said. “I think this letter comes close to the line, if not stepping over it.” The law passed the Senate 26-7 with no support from Democrats. It passed the House 58-11 with one Democrat in support and no Republicans opposed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Rowers, kayakers and other users of the Chicago River are getting a real-time look at one measure of water quality in the system that weaves through downtown and several neighborhoods. Chicago nonprofit Current installed three sensors in the river’s three main branches in 2019 to continuously estimate the amount of bacteria from human and other warm-blooded animals’ waste. The organization initially planned to begin making the real-time results public in 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic delayed its plans until Thursday, when a website updating with data taken every 15 minutes went online. The city’s development in the 19th century was thanks to the river – truly a system of rivers and manmade canals – that provided a path between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system. While the meatpacking and lumber industries could use it for shipping, the waterway also became a dumping ground for those and other industries and for sewage from homes and businesses. Quality of the 156-mile river system has improved in recent years, helped by multibillion-dollar construction of new reservoirs and underground tunnels. But when rain overwhelms Chicago’s sewer systems, sewage and stormwater is diverted to the river, prompting warnings to stay off the water for several days.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Schools got an incentive from the governor Wednesday to require face masks in classrooms in hopes of slowing down the number of COVID-19 outbreaks among students. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a new statewide executive order that eases quarantine requirements for students if all children and adults in the school were wearing masks throughout the day. The revised order comes as many Indiana schools have seen COVID-19 outbreaks and as the state’s vaccination rate remains stubbornly low. Holcomb said the coronavirus’ spread in Indiana was regrettable but avoidable. “To the skeptics or unbelievers or deniers, I would just plead to look at the facts, to look at the numerical data that shows we can all stay safe if you get vaccinated,” Holcomb said. Meanwhile, the state’s largest hospital system will be stopping all inpatient nonemergency surgeries as the state faces a growing surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Indiana University Health announced Thursday that the surgery suspension would start Monday. The decision comes after IU Health said last week that it was cutting such surgeries by half. IU Health, which operates 16 hospitals around the state, also said that more than 1,000 employees did not meet Wednesday’s deadline to get COVID-19 vaccinations and would be suspended immediately.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A federal judge on Thursday ordered a prominent participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to return to jail after he was caught accessing the internet to watch false conspiracy theories about the presidential election. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said Doug Jensen, 42, of Des Moines, had violated the strict conditions that were set when he was released from jail July 13, including prohibitions on accessing the internet and using a cellphone. Prosecutors had moved to revoke Jensen’s pretrial release Aug. 19, days after a federal officer found Jensen in his garage using an iPhone to watch news from Rumble, a streaming platform popular with conservatives. Jensen acknowledged that he had earlier watched two days of the cyber symposium sponsored by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who used the event to push false theories that the 2020 election’s outcome was changed by Chinese hackers. Kelly noted that he had released Jensen from jail in July after Jensen claimed he had an awakening behind bars and realized the QAnon conspiracy theory to which he adhered was a “pack of lies.” The judge said it was significant that Jensen’s violations were caught during the first unannounced visit to his home by pretrial services officers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About a third of Kansas nursing homes have less than half of their health care workers vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data released by the state. Just four of the more than 300 federally licensed nursing homes are meeting the state’s goal for 90% of health care workers vaccinated, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows. The departments released the data about a week after President Joe Biden announced that his administration will require nursing home staff to be vaccinated as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. The department for aging and disability services said in a statement last week that it released the data to prepare for those new rules. Gov. Laura Kelly’s office said in a statement, without offering details, that the administration would encourage nursing home workers to get inoculated. As of Wednesday, about 46% of Kansans were fully vaccinated, according to data provided by the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A judge has refused to grant a divorce decree to a couple who swore under oath that their marriage was irreparably broken. The reason, she said: They were too nice to each other in court. In a decision condemned by divorce lawyers, Bullitt Family Court Judge Monica Meredith at least temporarily declined to dissolve Douglas and Nicole Potts’ 13-year marriage, which both insist can’t be salvaged. In an Aug. 23 order continuing the case and suggesting the couple undergo counseling, Meredith observed they were “respectful and courteous toward one another, and both held themselves in dignified and mature composure.” Meredith, who was elected to Family Court in 2018, said that “divorce court does not typically bring that demeanor out in its participants.” But in interviews and emails, a half-dozen family lawyers said Meredith’s order was inappropriate, unlawful and ridiculous. “It sends a terrible message to litigants: You are better served by acting like a petulant child in court than by acting mature,” said Louisville attorney Hal Helmers, who wasn’t involved in the case. Louise Graham, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, said counseling may be ordered only if one side disagrees the marriage is over. “Ninety-nine percent of divorce lawyers agree with the above, and we can never agree on ANYTHING,” Helmers said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: Photos show what appears to be a miles-long oil slick near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida, according to aerial survey imagery released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reviewed by the Associated Press. The government imagery, along with additional photos taken by the AP from a helicopter Tuesday, also show Louisiana port facilities, oil refineries and shipyards in the storm’s path where the telltale rainbow sheen typical of oil and fuel spills is visible in the water of bays and bayous. Both state and federal regulators said Wednesday that they had been unable to reach the stricken area, citing challenging conditions in the disaster zone. The NOAA photos show a black slick floating in the Gulf near a large rig with the name Enterprise Offshore Drilling painted on its helipad. Aerial photos taken by NOAA on Tuesday also show significant flooding to the massive Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery along the bank of the Mississippi River, just south of New Orleans. In some sections of the refinery, rainbow sheen is visible on the water leading toward the river. Asked about reports of levee failures near the refinery Monday, Phillips 66 spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there was “some water” in the facility and stressed that operations were shut down before the storm.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Newly unionized nurses at Maine Medical Center are frustrated over the end of pandemic accommodations. The policies had let high-risk employees work outside COVID-19 care, covered COVID-19 treatment costs, provided quarantine pay for coronavirus exposure outside the workplace and allowed pregnant nurses to start paid maternity leave in the last month of their pregnancy. “In the middle of a spike in infections from a fast-moving variant, this is not the time to remove the protections that have helped both staff and patients here for the past several months,” nurse Madison Light said. The surge is causing nurses to scramble to staff the COVID-19 units. They’re not getting enough breaks, they said. “Now it feels like there is no end in sight. Nurses and caregivers are exhausted, frustrated, and stretched to their physical and emotional limits,” Light said. MaineHealth said its policies on COVID-19 exposure and pregnancy leave follow current clinical and OSHA guidelines. Accommodations for high-risk employees are considered on a case-by-case basis, the company said.\n\nMaryland\n\nThurmont: First responders in western Maryland used a boat to rescue 10 children and a driver from a school bus caught in rising floodwaters as the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon. Frederick County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Todd Wivell said the bus got stuck when it tried to cross a bridge in the Thurmont area that had water going across it, WTOP-FM reports. The driver and 10 children were rescued from the bus by boat, with the help of first responders from the sheriff’s office and the Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, he said. Even 6 inches of moving water is enough to knock a person off their feet, Wivell said. Frederick County Public Schools recalled all school buses that were in the process of dropping students off. Parents were asked to pick their kids up from school buildings. Frederick County Public Schools’ Superintendent Terry Alban apologized after facing criticism for not dismissing children early, saying the decision to remain open for a full day led to “stress and anxiety for many,” The Frederick News-Post reports. School systems in neighboring counties sent students home early ahead of forecasted inclement weather.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A question that would require voters to present an ID and a second that would grant new benefits for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft while stopping short of declaring them employees have cleared an initial hurdle on their way to next year’s ballot. Other proposed initiatives that received a constitutional green light from Attorney General Maura Healey’s office Wednesday would legalize the sale of fireworks, create a “whale safe fishing act,” allow for the return of “happy hours,” and create a “Right to Counsel Program” for those facing eviction. The questions were among 16 proposed laws and one proposed constitutional amendment that met the requirements for ballot initiatives outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution, according to Healey’s office. Another 13 proposals were deemed unconstitutional. The state constitution requires proposed initiatives be in the proper form to present to voters, not be substantially the same as any measure on the ballot in either of the two preceding statewide elections, contain only subjects related to each other and not involve topics specifically excluded from the ballot initiative process.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Thousands of Flint residents were put at potential risk because a New York law firm, for six months, used handheld X-ray devices to scan their bones for lead without first registering the devices and putting recommended safety measures in place, documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press show. Starting in about August 2020, the Napoli Shkolnik firm used the portable scanners – which are tools in the mining and scrap metal industries but are not designed for use on humans – as a way of bolstering residents’ claims for larger shares of a proposed $641.25 million settlement of civil lawsuits arising from the 2014 lead poisoning of Flint’s drinking water supply. The law firm’s failure until February 2021 to register the devices with the state of Michigan, as required by law, and the state’s low-key response once it learned the scanners had been used for months without required approvals add insult to the injury that was the Flint drinking water crisis. “Unfortunately, thousands of bone scans using these devices ... went forward under improper and illegal circumstances,” said Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician and former president and CEO of Mott’s Children’s Health Center, who first raised concerns about the scanners in a February court filing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys for three former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death asked a judge Thursday to bar their upcoming trial from being livestreamed, saying some witnesses won’t testify if the proceedings are broadcast. The request from attorneys for Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao is an about-face from their earlier request to have the trial publicly broadcast, and it is opposed by prosecutors and news outlets. Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to stand trial next March on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 2020 death. Their co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter after weeks of proceedings that marked the first time in Minnesota that a criminal trial was livestreamed in its entirety. Before Chauvin’s trial, attorneys for all four men requested the trials be broadcast, but Lane and Kueng recently backtracked, with their attorneys saying that the “worldwide publicity” from televised coverage of Chauvin’s trail “crushed” their clients’ right to a fair trial. Attorneys Earl Gray and Tom Plunkett say the public access led some witnesses to decline testifying for the defense, noting one witness in the Chauvin trial has been harassed and another faced professional scrutiny.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The U.S. Marshals Service has arrested a man in connection with an assault on an MSNBC reporter during a live broadcast from the state Monday. Benjamin Dagley was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a shopping center in Dayton, Ohio, according to a report. With the assistance of the public, the Gulfport Police Department identified Dagley, of Wooster, Ohio, as a suspect in an assault on Shaquille Brewster as he covered Hurricane Ida. Dagley allegedly pulled up in white pickup truck and ran toward the camera crew. The suspect could be heard off-camera repeatedly screaming something about reporting the hurricane accurately. Brewster attempted to go on with the live coverage, even shifting his position to move away from the suspect, but when he realized the accused was not backing down, Brewster tossed it back to the studio. As the camera faded, viewers could see Brewster being physically confronted. Gulfport police issued warrants Tuesday charging Dagley with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbance of the peace and one count of violating emergency curfew. Police also said Dagley is on probation for a previous charge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state senator from Kansas City said he is demanding answers after an exhibit on the gay rights movement in Missouri was removed from the state Capitol. Democrat Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay member of the Missouri Senate, said he was “appalled” when he was told the exhibit, “Making History: Kansas City and the Rise of Gay Rights,” had been removed from the Missouri State Museum. Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources, did not immediately reply to questions about why the exhibit was moved and who made the decision. On Tuesday, Uriah Stark, legislative aide for state Rep. Mitch Boggs, R-La Russell, posted pictures of the exhibit on Facebook and questioned why the “taxpayer funded museum is pushing the LGBT agenda in our state capitol?” The next day, Stark thanked “several of our great elected officials” for having the exhibit removed, specifically mentioning Republican Reps. Ann Kelley, of Lamar, and Brian Seitz, of Branson, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “There is NOTHING controversial about an exhibit that explains how members of the LGBT community fought to end persecution and demand rights as citizens,” Razer tweeted Thursday. “I’m extremely disappointed and angry that @mostateparks may think otherwise.”\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park is ending its reservation requirement to travel on the Going-to-the-Sun Road after Labor Day as the busy summer season winds down. The reservation system has been in place for anyone wanting to travel on the scenic highway since May 28. Reservations were required between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. The pilot program testing the reservation system worked to alleviate traffic, but park officials said some people struggled to find available tickets. The park’s shuttle service will also end after Labor Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government is stepping in to help shuffle patients between local hospitals that are dealing with a surge of people with COVID-19 and other health issues, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. The Republican governor said the state has partnered with Nomi Health, the creators of the TestNebraska program, to offer call centers that overcrowded hospitals can contact when they need to transfer patients elsewhere. The around-the-clock call centers will serve as coordinators for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed, at a cost of $200,000 a month. The announcement is another sign that the state is once again struggling with coronavirus cases, even though most of the hospitalizations are patients without the coronavirus. State officials opened a similar call center last year but ended the program after the number of cases and hospitalizations declined. The new call center is scheduled to open Saturday. Nebraska’s hospitals reported to the state Wednesday that 72% of their 3,234 beds were occupied, although some facilities were far more crowded and having to send patients to other places. Ricketts relaxed licensing restrictions for nurses last week in an attempt to fix severe staffing shortages.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. said Wednesday that a conference scheduled next month in Las Vegas by a group espousing the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon won’t be held at any Caesars property. It wasn’t immediately clear if the “Patriot Double Down” event organized by Patriot Voice would be moved, postponed or canceled. Caesars Entertainment executive Kate Whiteley confirmed a Las Vegas Review-Journal report that the Oct. 23-25 event billed as a “Great Awakening Weekend” won’t be held at the new Caesars Forum convention space near the Las Vegas Strip. With tickets from $650 to $3,000, the conference was billed to feature speakers including former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and 8kun website owner Jim Watkins. QAnon is a theory featuring the baseless belief that satanic pedophiles, child sex traffickers and cannibals are in collusion with the so-called deep state and will be uncovered at a reckoning followers call a “Great Awakening.” QAnon signs are often seen at rallies for ex-President Donald Trump, and some adherents are facing trial for roles in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The group also derides the COVID-19 pandemic as a “plandemic,” suggesting the coronavirus was manufactured and its severity exaggerated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it’s experiencing staff shortages during the coronavirus pandemic that range from nursing positions to food service workers. The health care system said Wednesday that it organized a “Managing and Staffing to Capacity” task force to identify solutions to the shortage, especially in the inpatient units and other care areas at its flagship hospital in Lebanon. Dartmouth-Hitchcock also began planning for reallocation of resources and staff. Earlier this year, it increased the starting rate for newly licensed nurses to $30 per hour and made wage adjustments for experienced clinical nurses and nurse supervisors. It plans to provide a 2% wage increase for other staff beginning in October. Joni Menard, task force leader, said that “the overall situation continues to be challenging as clinical demand increases and the supply of traveling staff is depleted across the nation.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Murphy administration officials used an unapproved encryption app at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and deleted correspondence “on at least one occasion,” according to new court records. The alleged use of the encrypted messaging application Telegram by Department of Health officials shows the limits of New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act and the ability to skirt them and other laws and rules, experts said. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy revealed that health officials were communicating on Telegram in the administration’s latest legal filing in the whistleblower lawsuit brought by Christopher Neuwirth, an assistant health commissioner who was fired shortly after first-wave peak of the coronavirus. In a 308-page response countering Neuwirth’s claim that he was improperly fired last May, Murphy’s lawyers said Neuwirth required employees who reported to him “use a non-state-approved messaging application – Telegram – furthering burdening those state employees.” The Open Public Records Act does not specifically address encrypted messages but does include emails and text messages used for official business in its definition of government records. Such records are subject to public access unless they fall under one of more than two dozen exemptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta officials say they’re canceling some parts of the event and will require guests to wear masks to enter the grounds and while in indoor areas and crowded outdoor settings to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Wednesday he didn’t believe that face mask requirements and other safety practices would affect attendance numbers for the Oct. 2-10 event. “Masks have been a way of life that we’ve all been experiencing for the past year or more, so I think it’s one of those things that people are used to,” he said. The music fiesta is being canceled this year due to close proximity of guests, and the discovery center is being shelved because of its indoor nature featuring activities with multiple touchpoints, officials said. Other steps being taken include providing cashless options to buy tickets, moving hospitality seating outdoors and increasing spacing between popular special-shape balloons inside the park, officials said. The changes track federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and the current public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Democratic-led Legislature voted Wednesday to extend an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for commercial and residential tenants who fell behind on their rent because of hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had called the Legislature to return for an “extraordinary session” to pass the legislation, which will put evictions on hold until Jan. 15. New York’s previous eviction moratorium, which included foreclosure protections for property owners, expired Tuesday. In an Aug. 12 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court nixed part of the moratorium that allowed tenants to pause eviction proceedings simply by filing a form declaring they’d had a COVID-19-related financial hardship or that moving in a pandemic would prove a health risk. The court said landlords should have the ability to challenge those hardships in court. New York is poised to change how the moratorium works in light of that ruling. Landlords will be able to challenge hardship declarations and direct judges to require tenants with hardships to apply for rental assistance. Hochul said the legislation will stand up to legal scrutiny. But the leader of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest organization of landlords in New York, vowed Wednesday to sue to block the moratorium in federal court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The majority of public school students taking standardized state exams in reading, math and science last school year failed them, data shows. State education leaders cautioned against making year-over-year comparisons with the tests taken during a school year marked by limited in-person instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 45.4% of K-12 students passed the exams for the 2020-21 school year, according to results released at a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday. Two years ago – the last time testing was required – nearly 59% of K-12 students passed state exams. The U.S. Education Department did not require states to test students in the 2019-20 school year but required it this past year to assess pandemic learning loss. Because of coronavirus safety concerns, some high school students this past year took exams months after completing the course on which they were being tested. Some tests were revised, and a lower-than-normal share of students took them, news outlets report. “While the 2018-19 data is included as a way to provide context, comparison of the two years should only be made with a recognition that multiple anomalies occurred during the 2020-21 school year and during test administration,” state board member Jill Camnitz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A lawmaker who heads the state’s anti-abortion legislative caucus said Thursday that it’s likely the Republican-led Legislature will seek to pass a measure mirroring a new Texas law that virtually bans all abortions and that the Supreme Court has allowed to remain in force. GOP Sen. Janne Myrdal, one of the Legislature’s most ardent anti-abortion lawmakers, said she “assumes” legislation will be crafted eventually that uses the Texas law as a template. “I hear people talking about it,” Myrdal said. About a third of the Legislature’s 141 members are active in the caucus, which already has successfully pushed some of the nation’s toughest abortion laws. If it is drafted, it’s unclear when it would be introduced, though it could happen when the Legislature meets later this year in a reconvened or special session meant to deal with legislative redistricting. North Dakota is one of several states that have so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Myrdal said the high court’s action – or lack thereof – offers “a glimmer of hope” the court might eventually overturn Roe v. Wade because of its shift to the right following the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief this week launched an effort to purge inactive voters from state rolls, while using the announcement to push for passage of a bill making several changes to Ohio’s election process. The four-year process for purging inactive voters targets those who have not voted for two years and whose addresses may have changed and whose voter registration must be updated to reflect the move, according to Wednesday’s directive by GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose to Ohio’s 88 county elections boards. Inactive voters can keep themselves on the rolls by voting in any election in the next four years, submitting an absentee ballot application, registering to vote or taking other election-related steps. Earlier this year, LaRose said 97,795 inactive voter files were removed in scheduled post-2020 election voter roll maintenance, a lower number than predicted after thousands of voters avoided the purge by voting and undertaking other election activities. In his announcement Wednesday, LaRose also urged for the passage of a Republican voting bill introduced this spring that prohibits the placement of ballot drop boxes anywhere but at local elections offices, eliminates a day of early voting, shortens the window for requesting mail-in ballots and tightens voter ID requirements.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge on Wednesday said she will temporarily block a state law banning public school mask mandates, but students or their parents can opt out of the requirement if they choose. Judge Natalie Mai said she will issue a temporary injunction that will go into effect next week when she issues a written order detailing her ruling. Mai said she is blocking the law because it applies only to public, not private, schools, and schools adopting a mask mandate must provide an option for parents or students to opt out of the requirement. The ruling drew praise from Gov. Kevin Stitt, who signed the law and opposes mask mandates without exemptions, and Dr. Mary Clarke, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, which joined the lawsuit brought by four parents who oppose the law. “This is a victory for parental choice, personal responsibility and the rule of law,” Stitt said in a statement. Clarke said she was also pleased with the ruling. “This is just a first step in ensuring our schools maintain local control and can choose the best path for their students, faculty and staff,” Clarke said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Slugs and snails love bread dough, finds recent research from the Oregon State University Extension Service and other universities, suggesting a cheap, easy-to-make, nontoxic and widely available solution for gardeners and farmers alike. The state’s grass seed industry loses roughly $100 million a year to the slimy pests, according to the Oregon Seed Council. “Slugs and snails have a big impact on seed crops,” said Roger Beyer, the council’s executive director. “Our guys will work with anything, be it biological, pesticides or chemicals – whatever it takes to protect their crops, but it has to be economical.” The Oregon Seed Council provides $60,000 to $70,000 a year to fund slug and snail research at OSU, including for the work of gastropod specialist Rory McDonnell, who participated in the multi-university study that discovered bread dough attracts the pests. McDonnell and his fellow researchers ran simple experiments comparing how slugs and snails are attracted to different foods, essentially pitting foods in head-to-head contests until one was determined the most attractive. Cucumber was an early front-runner, and beer and strawberries did well, but bread dough was what really called the mollusks to dinner. McDonnell said it might be deployed in the creation of molluscicides, but dough should work for now.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change passed its last regulatory hurdle Wednesday, in a hard-fought bid to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. The plan to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants won a 3-2 party-line vote from the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, a five-member panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees. The commission voted after almost six hours of testimony and nearly two years of Wolf’s administration working on the regulation and shepherding it through the long regulatory process. The vote allows Pennsylvania, through regulation, to join a multistate consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By joining the consortium, “Pennsylvania is taking a historic, proactive and progressive approach that will have significant positive environmental, public health and economic impacts,” Wolf said in a statement after the vote. Mark Szybist, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it the “most important climate action that Pennsylvania has taken in more than a decade.” At 34%, Pennsylvania’s energy sector is its largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: Some residents will be paying more for their health insurance next year, but not as much as insurers wanted them to pay, the state Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner said Thursday. The rate increases for 2022 approved by Commissioner Patrick Tigue were lower than insurers has requested. “As Rhode Islanders confront significant threats to their health and financial well-being due to the spread of COVID-19, my responsibility is to limit the burden of the cost of health insurance within the standards for review and approval set forth by law,” Tigue said in a statement. “Given the strong reserve positions of health insurers operating in the state, I did not believe that charges for profit and contributions to reserves for 2022 were consistent with the proper conduct of the insurers’ business or consistent with the public interest.” Rhode Islanders will save almost $42 million in 2022 compared to what the commercial health insurers requested, his office said. For Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which has 40,255 members in its small group plan and requested an average rate increase of 2.9%, Tigue approved a 0.3% decrease. Gail Carvelli, a spokesperson for BCBSRI, told The Boston Globe the company accepted the modifications and recognized the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Thursday tossed out a school mask mandate in the capital city, saying it contradicts a state budget measure aimed at preventing face covering requirements. State Attorney General Alan Wilson had sued Columbia after the City Council passed the ordinance requiring masks at elementary and middle schools. City leaders said the mask requirement, which carries a $100 violation fine, was meant to protect children too young to be approved for COVID-19 vaccines. But Wilson argued the city’s mask rule conflicts with the budget requirement that went into effect July 1 and bans school districts from using appropriated funds to require face coverings. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court sided unanimously with the attorney general. The Columbia ordinance is written so that the burden of enforcing the mask rule falls on school employees, “all of whom have an obvious connection to state-appropriated funds,” wrote Justice John Kittredge. That means school employees have to choose between violating state or city laws, the opinion said. “The City has made clear that every school employee is in the crosshairs,” Kittredge wrote.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers looking to remake the state’s voter-passed medical marijuana law previewed a coming battle in the Legislature on Wednesday as they recommended outlawing growing the plant in homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. A legislative subcommittee approved a spate of recommended changes to a ballot measure approved by 70% of voters last year. The law is set to take full effect in the coming months as the state government faces deadlines to issue medical marijuana identification cards and provide for the licensure of dispensaries. However, the law will continue to be in flux. Republicans, who dominate the Legislature, are currently debating just how far to go in changing the law. The subcommittee on Wednesday recommended changes that could potentially make it more difficult for people in rural areas to access the drug – most significantly by striking all provisions allowing medical marijuana ID-card holders to grow cannabis plants in their homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. The recommendations will next face approval by the Marijuana Interim Study Committee before they can be passed to the full Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state Department of Education video celebrating the return to school drew sharp criticism across social media. The 41-second video released Tuesday features Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who shares her own memories of excitedly starting school as a kindergartner. “All of our students – 1 million of them – across the state of Tennessee are starting the school year right now,” Schwinn says. “The smell of new books, clean hallways, the energy and feeling of being back in classrooms with their friends and their teachers. It’s such a special time, and I am so excited for our state.” She then asks parents to share stories about why they are excited for the new school year in the comments. The video received swift feedback from parents and teachers experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, quarantines and a growing number of schools already closing as the coronavirus spreads. As of Wednesday, Tennessee was averaging a record-setting 2,330 infections per day among school-age children, ages 5 to 18, according to state data. “How tone deaf do you have to be to ask parents to ‘share their stories’?” commenter Joshua Allen said on Facebook. Several commenters said they sent kids back to school after 18 months of avoiding the virus only to have their children exposed or infected within a few weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The state on Wednesday became the 20th and largest in the nation to allow some form of the unregulated carry of a firearm. Under the new law, most people 21 or older who haven’t been convicted of a felony can carry a holstered handgun – concealed or otherwise – in public without undergoing any training or getting a permit. Supporters of the law, including Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature, laud it as a necessary expansion of the so-called constitutional carry movement that will allow people to more easily defend themselves without government interference. But critics, including some law enforcement groups and others, say this further loosening of firearms restrictions in a state that has had more than its share of mass shootings is reckless. Until Wednesday, Texans needed a license to carry a handgun outside their homes and vehicles. To get one, they had to submit fingerprints, go through several hours of training on gun laws and gun safety, and pass a shooting proficiency test. Now, they can still take an online training course that the law requires the state to provide, but it is not necessary. While recent mass shootings have put many on edge, Texas has cultivated a strong culture of gun ownership with echoes of the Wild West, and many residents support the loosened restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A suspect charged with setting fire to three churches in the city and then leading police on a high-speed chase across Washington County that didn’t end until he crashed his minivan inside Zion National Park told police he was a “type of deity” who was acting in “righteous anger.” The man was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on seven separate charges, including two second-degree felony counts of arson and a third-degree felony count of failing to stop for a police officer, according to a report filed in 5th District Court. Local fire officials and federal agents had been investigating the string of fires as a possible hate crime, as all three happened at houses of worship of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. The suspect, a 36-year-old identified as Benjamin Johnson, was being held without bail. The police report suggests investigators worried that he could be a danger to the community and that his mental health was a consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A refugee resettlement organization is offering to accept about 100 Afghan refugees over the next several weeks if its proposal is approved by the U.S. State Department. Amila Merdzanovic of the Vermont chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said that if the request is approved, the state’s well-publicized housing crisis will prompt her organization to look for families to host at least some of the new arrivals. It would not be the first time refugees arriving in Vermont lived with host families. “In the 1970s and 1980s when Laotians and Cambodians were coming into the state, there was no refugee resettlement program, so people were being hosted by Vermonters,” said Merdzanovic, who came to Vermont in 1995 as a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina and lived with a host family when she first arrived. “That’s the model we are looking to implement.” She said Thursday that since word of the proposal first became public Wednesday, she has already received dozens of messages of support. Historically, Vermont has not been a location where refugees with the types of visas granted to the Afghans have been resettled. Merdzanovic said last week she was not expecting any Afghans, but she learned Aug. 25 that refugee resettlement agencies had two days to submit proposals.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the state can remove an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a prominent spot in its capital city, saying that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The 7-0 decision cited testimony from historians that the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the Southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. More than a century later, its continued display “communicates principles that many believe to be inconsistent with the values the Commonwealth currently wishes to express,” the justices ruled. The high court’s decision came in two lawsuits filed by residents who attempted to block Gov. Ralph Northam’s order to remove the bronze equestrian sculpture, which shows Lee in military attire atop a massive stone pedestal. Virginia promised to forever maintain the statue in the 1887 and 1890 deeds that transferred its ownership to the state. But the justices said that obligation no longer applies. “Those restrictive covenants are unenforceable as contrary to public policy and for being unreasonable because their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees,” the justices wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, the state’s most populous county is reinstating outdoor mask mandates for large events and strongly encouraging people to wear masks in other outdoor settings when they can’t remain 6 feet apart. In a statement Thursday, Public Health – Seattle & King County said as of Tuesday there will be a requirement for face masks for outdoor events of 500 or more people. The directive applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people over age 5. The recommendation for outdoor masks when people are unable to socially distance from non-household members is also for people 5 and up regardless of vaccination status. “With high rates of disease spread, and our health care system straining to keep up, it is time to take additional steps to keep ourselves and our communities safe,” the health agency said. King County, which includes Seattle, is home to about 2.2 million people.

The federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is giving the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection 60 days to submit an amendment to its reclamation program, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. An Aug. 23 letter from federal officials to state officials said a review found that the program “has not taken sufficient steps” to make sure reclamation obligations are estimated correctly. Such a failure can lead to unfunded environmental liabilities, the letter said. “The WVDEP recognizes the concerns raised in OSMRE’s notice related to reporting and disclosure and those issues will be addressed,” Environmental Protection Department Secretary Harold Ward said in a statement Wednesday, without specifying what kind of amendment the agency plans to submit. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s review of the state’s reclamation program follows lawsuits filed by environmentalist groups.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Calling the situation horrific and inexcusable, city, county and state leaders said this week that they are committed to doing what it takes to improve conditions that leave Black renters in Milwaukee far more vulnerable to electrical fires than anybody else in the city. “These people paid for a place that ultimately took their lives,” said State Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, who represents part of the city most affected by suspected electrical fires. “That’s inexcusable. ... I have no choice but to find a way to get this addressed. I honestly didn’t know that people were literally losing their lives and everything they own like this.” Johnson said she plans to reach out to Gov. Tony Evers’ office and work with colleagues in the Legislature to consider changes that could help tackle the problem. The reaction follows a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that uncovered how suspected electrical fires disproportionately harm Black renters in the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and how systems at all levels of government fail to address the underlying issues. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Evers said. “It’s very disheartening.” Evers said he already has spoken to staff members about potential ways to address the problem, which he blamed largely on legislative changes in the last decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city expects to face labor shortages across all industries as school-related coronavirus cases spike, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.

Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

The survey finds the public’s outlook on the state of the country the worst it’s been since 2009, while its view on the economy is the worst since 2011. And nearly 7 in 10 say President Joe Biden hasn’t paid enough attention to the nation’s most pressing problems.\n\nBiden’s approval rating in the poll stands at 38%, with 62% disapproving. His approval ratings for handling the economy (30%) and inflation (25%) are notably lower. Rising costs are a primary economic pressure for most Americans: 75% call inflation and the cost of living the most important economic problem facing their family. Last summer, that figure stood at 43%.\n\nWith midterm elections approaching, the poll finds no indication that Biden’s standing with the public is improving – and among some critical constituencies, it is worsening. Among Democrats, for example, Biden’s approval numbers have softened by 13 points since the spring (from 86% in a late April through early May poll to 73% now), while his numbers among independents and Republicans have held about even. Biden’s approval rating among Democrats for handling the economy is also on the decline (62% approve, down from 71% this spring). And on inflation, it is barely above water (51% of Democrats approve, 47% disapprove).\n\nAmong people of color, 45% now approve of Biden’s overall performance, down from 54% in the spring. That decline includes a 6-point dip among Black adults and a 9-point decline among Hispanic adults. Biden’s approval ratings for handling the economy and inflation now break negative among Black adults, who have been among the President’s strongest backers (47% approve and 52% disapprove on the economy, while 34% approve and 65% disapprove on inflation).\n\nFew Americans who approve of Biden’s overall performance say they do so strongly. Overall, just 12% strongly approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency compared with 43% who say they strongly disapprove of his work. Only 28% of Democrats strongly approve, while among Republicans, strong disapproval is nearly universal at 84%.\n\nThe public’s perceptions of the economy and of how things are going in the country overall are deeply negative and worsening. Since the spring, the share saying things are going badly for the country has climbed 11 points to 79%, the highest since February 2009, and shy of the all-time worst reached in November 2008 by just four points. That shift comes largely among Democrats. Just 38% of Democrats now say things are going well in the country, down from 61% this spring. Likewise, there’s been a steep drop among people of color, from 41% saying things were going well in the spring to 27% now.\n\nOnly 18% of Americans describe the nation’s economy as in good shape, while 82% say economic conditions are poor. About 4 in 10 (41%) describe the economy as “very poor,” up 11 points since the spring and nearly doubled since December. As some economists warn of a looming recession, most Americans think the country is already there. The poll finds 64% of Americans feel the economy is currently in a recession, higher than the shares who said so just ahead of the Great Recession (46% felt that way in October 2007) and a recession that began in 2001 (44% said the country was already in a recession in February ’01). Majorities across parties say the country is already in a recession, including 56% of Democrats, 63% of independents and 76% of Republicans.\n\nAsked to name the biggest economic problem facing their family today, 75% call out an issue related to the cost of living or inflation, including 38% who mentioned inflation and rising costs generally, 29% who mention gas prices, and 18% who mention the cost of food. All of those figures have increased sharply since last summer. One poll participant said, “Prices on everything just keeps getting higher and higher. is it going to stop?” Another said, “I work 40+ hours and can barely afford to survive. With the price of gas and price of food so high, I don’t see how anyone can have extra money to do anything other than work.” And a third participant said, “Inflation causes so much pain with everything we buy and everything we do.”\n\nWhile the public’s attention has shifted sharply to inflation, few think the President’s focus has followed. In the poll, 68% say Biden has not paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems, up from 58% who said so last November. That outpaces the previous high in CNN polling saying a President’s attention has been misplaced (59% saying Donald Trump hadn’t paid attention to the most important problems in late summer 2017).\n\nOn this question too, Biden is losing ground among his core support groups. Among Democrats, 57% say he has the right priorities, down nearly 20 points from 75% last fall. Among people of color, just 35% say he has the right priorities, and among those younger than 35, only 23% say the President has the right focus.\n\nThe poll finds Biden’s approval ratings for handling immigration (39%) and the situation in Ukraine (46%) outperforming those for economic issues, but majorities disapprove on both issues.\n\nThe survey also suggests both the President’s and vice president’s personal favorability has taken a hit. A year and a half ago, just before their inauguration, 59% held a favorable opinion of Biden and 51% had a favorable view of Kamala Harris. Now, those figures stand at 36% and 32% respectively. Meanwhile, the public’s view of first lady Jill Biden is mixed: 34% have a favorable opinion, 29% unfavorable and 37% are unsure how they feel about her.\n\nThe new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS June 13 through July 13 among a random national sample of 1,459 adults initially reached by mail, and is the third survey CNN has conducted using this methodology.

Vote-by-mail advocates dispute both claims. Although some Republican governors and secretaries of state favor more absentee voting, others have said a large-scale expansion in six months is unrealistic.\n\n\"Because Trump is in power, his M.O. has to be, let's replicate as closely as possible the conditions under which he was elected.

Five states – Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington – hold all-mail elections in which all registered voters are mailed ballots. More than two-thirds of voting in three other states – Arizona, California and Montana – is conducted by mail.\n\nIn 16 states, voters can receive mail ballots but only if they meet certain exceptions such as being 65 years or older, having a disability, or being out of the county on Election Day and during the early voting period.\n\nLeaders in some of these 16 states, including Delaware and Connecticut, have taken steps toward expanded vote-by-mail or pledged support. But other states led by Republicans, particularly in the South, have expressed concerns about changes\n\nThe state of Tennessee was sued on Friday by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Campaign Legal Center – on behalf of two voters and five organizations, including Tennessee’s NAACP chapter – over its absentee voting law, which the plaintiffs said is among the nation's most restrictive.\n\nThe groups argue the U.S. Constitution does not allow Tennessee to require voters to \"jeopardize their health and safety\" in order to exercise their fundamental right to vote.\n\nMore:Amid vote-by-mail push, civil rights groups say in-person voting still needed during pandemic\n\nThe poll found even greater support for absentee voting as an alternative during the pandemic –74% of Americans in favor and 21% in opposition – and in-person early voting, 74%-24%. Americans are split on online voting, with 48% opposing and 47% supporting.\n\nVoting rights advocates, including the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York School of Law, have sounded the alarm about the urgency for quick action to build the necessary infrastructure for vote-by-mail on a national scale.\n\nTheir fear is a nationwide repeat of last month's Wisconsin primary when voters were forced to weigh safety with exercising their democratic rights. Many stood in line for hours wearing face masks to brave their way to the polls, particularly in the state's largest city, Milwaukee.\n\nBut the estimated price-tag needed to pay for everything from postage stamps to signature-identification software is at least $2 billion The CARES Act, approved by Congress last month, allocated $400 million to election security amid the pandemic, but states aren't required to use the money on vote-by-mail.\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ron Wyden of Oregon, introduced the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act in March that seeks to ensure all voters nationwide can vote absentee and at least 20 days of early voting. The bill, which lacks any Republican co-sponsors, is a long shot to pass in the GOP-led Senate.\n\n\"Politicians follow all of the polls very closely,\" Paleologos said. \"It's not the pollsters talking here. It's people.

But there is a common thread: Concern.\n\nWhen asked her outlook on the future of American democracy, Patricia Reasoner, an 83-year-old independent from Vermont, said, “I’m concerned because we came so close this time and we’re not putting enough controls in place to keep it from happening again so far. And if it happens again, I’m afraid it will topple us.”\n\nIn January 2021, shortly after the attack on the US Capitol, 59% of Americans said they had at least some confidence that US elections reflected the will of the people. That included 36% who were very confident that elections were representative of the public’s wishes.\n\nNow, a year and a half later, only 42% have some confidence, and just 16% are very confident.\n\nThe biggest shifts over that time have come among Democrats and independents, even as Democrats remain the political group most likely to express confidence in American elections. In early 2021, 90% of Democrats said they were at least somewhat confident that elections reflected the will of the people; now, just 57% are. Among independents, the share who have at least some confidence has fallen from 54% to 38%. Among Republicans, by contrast, confidence has modestly increased but remained low, from 23% confident then to 29% now.\n\nKelly Woodward, a teacher and parent from Denver, where all voters receive mail ballots, said her experience of voting has been largely positive.\n\n“I take both girls when I do it, when I drop off the ballot, and they sit with me as I’m filling it out. I know for my parents, who are older and are both very politically active, it’s very easy for them, which I appreciate, because it would be hard for them to go stand in line.”\n\nBut Woodward, a Democrat, has concerns about how well the system works elsewhere. “Even though it works for me, I don’t think it works for everybody, and it shouldn’t be that way in our country. It should be the same for everybody; they should feel that it works for them.”\n\nSome worried that not everyone who should be able to vote actually could. LaRee Smith, a health care worker in Washington state said in an email to CNN, “[M]y biggest concern is not for myself but for voters in states (particularly in the South) where conservatives appear to be ramping up voter suppression and intimidation for citizens in lower socioeconomic classes.”\n\nAnd Isaac Odibo, a Democrat from Norfolk, Virginia, said the nation’s election system is weaker now because, “a lot of people qualified to vote might be prevented from voting because of all the laws placed and new laws being passed.”\n\nBut on the other side, Republicans’ concerns seem rooted in doubts about the last presidential election, even as there has been no evidence of either voter fraud or tampering that would change the results. Despite the lack of evidence, numerous candidates for office and former President Donald Trump continue to push the falsehood that the election was stolen.\n\nStill, Ruben Andres Delgado, a 26-year-old Republican from El Paso, Texas, said of 2020, “Anyone with logic and reasoning could tell you something fishy happened, something illegitimate happened.”\n\nAnd another survey-taker from Northport, Alabama, who did not wish to be named, said, “There were instances of polls going smoothly and turning in the true vote count. But there were also instances that were claims from viewers and people working the polls that that didn’t take place, so there was a question mark.”\n\nThe survey was conducted as the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol held public hearings on its findings.\n\nWoodward has been following the hearings a little bit.\n\n“I just never thought in my lifetime that I would have seen something like January 6,” she said. “I guess there’s a fear of if that could happen, and if there aren’t any lasting consequences for the individuals who participated, does that just leave the door open for that to happen again? I do place great importance on the hearings, and sort of the precedent that that sets that this cannot happen in our country.”\n\nSusan Loconsole, a Democrat from Carol Stream, Illinois, who has been watching as much of the hearings as she can and said she felt “devastated” by the attack, believes the election system has been weakened in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“I don’t think that there’s suddenly any more fraud or anything different going on,” she said. “It’s just one person saying there was and having so many people that believe everything he says, that they now have taken that as their message. There in itself is the most frightening thing in this country.”\n\nAmericans’ views on the likelihood that an election in the US would be overturned for partisan reasons have held steady at a roughly even split since last summer. Republicans (53% very or somewhat likely) and Democrats (49%) are about equally apt to say it is likely an election would be overturned, but Republicans are more likely to see such an outcome as “very” likely (21% among Republicans vs. 11% among Democrats).\n\nThe poll participant from Alabama, a retired teacher who backed Trump in 2020, said, “I still have my values, so I’m going to vote for the candidate that I normally would vote for, but there’s a concern about the correct candidates that are truly elected being put in office.” Transparency, the respondent said, was key. “Make sure the true vote is shown, whether it’s the vote I want or not, it should be the true vote, the true voice of the American people.”\n\nLoconsole, the Democrat from Illinois, expressed faith that the results would be trustworthy. “I will, again, trust the system in the next election, even if that means that the Republicans take over.”\n\nAnd when asked about her views on the future of American democracy, Woodward, the teacher from Colorado, said, “I’m an optimist. I have to be to wake up and vote and to watch the news. I am optimistic that people will do the right thing and that we’ll find a way to come together, also because I have children and teach children. I just have to think that good things are on the horizon, and that we can do this.”\n\nThe new CNN poll was conducted by SSRS June 13 through July 13 among a random national sample of 1,459 adults initially reached by mail, and is the third survey CNN has conducted using this methodology.

Some keep guns for protection, hunting or sport, while others see guns and the lax regulations around them as a threat to life and safety. Recurring tragedies involving guns contribute to a climate of fear in which those positions become more entrenched.\n\nUnderstanding gun ownership in the US can help inform debates about firearm laws (or lack thereof). Obtaining a precise picture, however, is challenging because no definitive database of gun sales exists. What we have to rely on then are polls and survey data from think tanks and academic researchers, which vary somewhat in their estimates. Still, there are some broad trends that stand out.\n\nHere’s what those polls and surveys tell us about who owns guns in the US.\n\nWhite men have the highest rates of gun ownership\n\nThree in 10 adults say they personally own a gun, while four in 10 say they live in a household where someone owns a gun, according to a 2017 survey from Pew Research Center.\n\nOn the whole, gun owners are more likely to be White and male. They’re also more likely to live in rural areas and identify as Republican.\n\nAbout 48% of White men say they own a gun, the Pew survey found. By contrast, 24% of White women and 24% of non-White men said they owned a gun. Women of color reported the lowest rates of gun ownership at 16%.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there is a stark partisan divide in gun ownership. About 44% of adults who identify as Republican or lean Republican say they own a gun, while just 20% of those who identify as Democrat or lean Democrat say they do, according to Pew.\n\nWhere a person lives also plays a role. The Pew survey found that 46% of those who lived in rural areas said they owned a gun, while only 28% of suburbanites and 19% of city dwellers owned a gun. The Northeast has the lowest rates of gun ownership at 16%, while roughly a third of people in the South, Midwest and West report personally owning a gun.\n\nThere are also some slight variations in gun ownership across educational levels. Those who have a bachelor’s degree or higher are somewhat less likely to own a gun, compared to those who have a high school diploma or only completed some college.\n\nHow a person is raised can also influence gun ownership. About 67% of gun owners say they grew up in a gun-owning household, while only 40% of those who don’t own guns did, Pew researchers report.\n\nOnly a few gun owners hold a large share of guns\n\nThere are more guns in the US than people.\n\nThere are about 393 million privately owned firearms in the US, according to an estimate by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey – or in other words, 120 guns for every 100 Americans. That’s the highest rate of any country in the world, and more than double the rate of the next country on the list.\n\nA majority of those guns, however, are owned by a minority of people, studies show.\n\nTake, for example, a report published in 2017 by researchers at Harvard and Northeastern universities. The authors estimate that of the 265 million privately owned firearms in the US, about half are owned by 3% of the US adult population. And while about half of gun owners own one or two guns, 8% of gun owners own 10 or more – a figure that amounts to about 40% of the total US gun stock, according to the report.\n\nAnother finding that bears that out: National polls show that gun ownership has declined modestly since the 1970s, while FBI firearm background checks show that gun purchases are at record highs. What that suggests is that while the share of gun owners in the US is getting smaller overall, those who do own guns are buying more and more of them.\n\nMost gun owners say they own guns for protection\n\nPeople own guns for a number of purposes, and most gun owners say they own a gun for more than one reason.\n\nProtection is a motivator for a vast majority of people. A Gallup survey conducted in October 2021 found that 88% of gun owners counted protection against crime as a reason for owning a gun, while 70% counted target shooting and 56% counted hunting as reasons. Similarly, Pew found that two-thirds of gun owners cited protection as a major reason for owning a gun, while about four in 10 cited hunting and three in 10 cited sport shooting as major reasons.\n\nAbout three-quarters of gun owners see firearms as key to their freedoms, while about half see them as important to their identities, according to Pew.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/sport/mlb-opening-day-baseball-popularity-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "MLB Opening Day: Why is baseball no longer America's Game? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nMajor League Baseball is finally back. Despite a lockout and delay in Opening Day, the players are actually going to take the field. When my father, born in 1927, was my age, Opening Day was one of the biggest events on the sports calendar.\n\nFor his son, it’s just another day. It’s not that I don’t like baseball – I do. It’s that baseball is not the sport that stands out above all others in my mind.\n\nMy family’s story is part of a larger one about America’s declining interest in baseball and generational replacement.\n\nThe sport, which was once the most popular in the country, has a bevy of problems that has landed it, at best, a distant second place in America’s hearts. This is especially true among America’s youth.\n\nJust 11% of adults listed baseball as their favorite sport to watch in a 2021 Washington Post poll. That put it well behind football (34%) and tied with basketball for the second favorite sport. Soccer and “something else” (e.g. esports/competitive video gaming) were closely behind at 7%.\n\nWhen examining the poll more in-depth, the problem baseball has becomes both more apparent – and even scarier. A mere 7% of those under the age of 30 say baseball is their favorite sport. This ranked fifth behind football (24%), basketball (17%), “something else” (12%) and soccer (10%).\n\nWhile these fans are overjoyed to be at the ballpark, only 11% of total adults and 7% of people aged under 30 in the US list baseball as their favorite sport. Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nTo put baseball’s overall 11% in perspective, there were many more fans of baseball the last time there was a work stoppage in 1994. In an average of Gallup polls that year, 19% of Americans said baseball was their favorite sport.\n\nWhile the 1994 baseball strike may have hurt the sport’s popularity, the truth is baseball had been on the decline for a while. Baseball hadn’t ranked as America’s favorite sport to watch since 1960, when 34% said it was. Soccer that year came in at less than 0.5%, while football picked up 21% support. By the next poll Gallup did on the subject in 1972, baseball was second to football.\n\nThe rise of TV\n\nThe fact that 1960 is the last time baseball reigned supreme is notable. The sports landscape has changed dramatically from 62 years ago.\n\nOne big reason baseball no longer finds itself the darling of American sports is competition and the dawn of the television age.\n\nThe NFL didn’t sign its first league-wide TV contract until 1962; it led to every game being on television and each team receiving a share of the revenue pie. This came around the same time that the AFL – a rival league which would eventually merge with the NFL – started play and signed its own league-wide TV deal.\n\nAfter this point, this meant that over 20 teams had their contests televised, and the country had universal access to the pro game. Additionally, the Super Bowl would begin in 1967. The NFL, of course, is a sport that benefits tremendously from being seen. Baseball, on the other hand, doesn’t gain as much going from radio to television.\n\nAn NBC camera at Yankee Stadium circa 1950 in the Bronx, New York City. MLB/Getty Images\n\nAnother sport which is better visually than audibly is basketball. The NBA was less than 15 years old in 1960. There were just eight NBA teams at that point – half the size of either professional baseball or football. The NBA Finals wouldn’t be aired in their entirety nationally until 1970.\n\nThe country was years away from a successful professional soccer league in 1960 – let alone the incarnation of the MLS. Now, a soccer fan can watch games from here and those across the Atlantic Ocean – the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League, for example – with ease.\n\nAs for other sports, there were only six NHL teams compared to the 32 today. And the idea of competitive video gaming was a science fiction fantasy and not at all conceivable.\n\nThe increased competition and the use of screens to watch sports came at an inopportune time for baseball.\n\nIf bored, Americans can change the channel very quickly. On social media platforms like TikTok, things go by faster than a bullet train. Baseball is anything but fast as far as Americans are concerned.\n\nCheck out this 2007 Gallup poll when people who weren’t pro baseball fans were asked why they didn’t like the sport. The two top reasons given were boring/uninteresting (31%) and games being too slow/too long (21%).\n\nBaseball boredom?\n\nThe Atlanta Braves' Truist Park during the national anthem prior to Game Four of the 2021 World Series against the Houston Astros. Michael Zarrilli/Getty Images\n\nWhen you look at the data from actual games, you get why people might think the sport is either too boring or too slow.\n\nBalls being put into play have shrunk dramatically, and the strikeout rate has skyrocketed. About 100 years ago, there were well more than twice as many hits than strikeouts in baseball. In 1960, there were 1.7 times as many hits than strikeouts. Last year, there were nearly 3,000 more strikeouts than hits.\n\nIn most sports besides baseball or football, the game is constantly in action. Unlike in baseball, there’s a real rhythm to when each football play starts up with a moving game and play clock.\n\nIncreasingly too, baseball fans need to sit through a game which is taking longer and longer to finish. The length of the average a nine-inning game has gone from two hours and 33 minutes in 1960 to three hours and 10 minutes in 2021. Compare this with a soccer match, which has 90 minutes of play, a 15-minute halftime and some stoppage time – usually two to four minutes.\n\nAdditionally, there simply isn’t a sport that requires someone to sit through more minutes with so little action – so often. While NFL game lengths are similar, remember that an MLB team has 162 regular season games per year. The NFL has just 17.\n\nPerhaps, people might be more willing to sit through long games if they cared about the players. Many people have pointed out the fact that baseball doesn’t have any “stars” as a reason why the sport has struggled.\n\nIn an era in which fans are increasingly rooting for players over teams, this could be a big problem.\n\nOne way we can look at this is through the number of Instagram followers the top athletes in baseball, basketball and football have.\n\nArguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years, Mike Trout still lags far behind his sport competitors on social media. Billie Weiss/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n\nMike Trout – arguably the best MLB player of the last 50 years alone – has only about two million followers. This trails NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. and his more than 15 million followers. It’s well behind NBA great LeBron James, who has over 100 million followers. International soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has over 420 million followers, though many of those are outside the United States.\n\nThe inability to be big on social media is just one reason that baseball is likely struggling with today’s youth.\n\nBeyond social media, there was a time when the greatest baseball stars were household names. Consider a 1945 poll from Gallup asking Americans whether they knew who different stars across various industries were.\n\nMore than 90% said they knew who former baseball star Babe Ruth was. The vast majority – 90% of all Americans – not only knew who he was but were able to give a description of what he was famous for. Keep in mind, this poll was taken 10 years after Ruth last suited up to play professional baseball.\n\nRuth was better known at the time than World War II General George Patton. The same percentage of Americans knew who Ruth was as they did future president and five-star General Dwight Eisenhower, who had just helped lead the Americans to victory in Europe.\n\nModern polling indicates that there isn’t any modern baseball player who is anywhere near the level of recognition of Ruth. In fact, some data indicates that less than half of Americans even know who Trout is.\n\nThe lack of star power just isn’t the case in basketball or football. You have stars like James and the recently retired Tom Brady, who have Ruth-level name identification among the American public. Both sports, not surprisingly, have many more athletes known by at least 50% of the public than baseball.\n\nIs there anything baseball can do to reverse the tide? I don’t know.\n\nPerhaps the better question to ask at this point is whether baseball is merely trading on its legacy. As the Greatest Generation – i.e. my father’s – fades into the memory books, it seems quite plausible that baseball’s spot in the top 2 or 3 favorite sports in America may fade along with it.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/cnn-poll-biden-2024/index.html", "title": "CNN Poll: 75% of Democratic voters want someone other than ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new CNN poll finds 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than President Joe Biden in the 2024 election, a sharp increase from earlier this year.\n\nThe poll comes as Biden’s approval ratings remain low and most Americans are discontented with the state of the country and the economy. Inflation remains high and a new report released Tuesday showed consumer confidence slipped for the third straight month.\n\nTwenty-four percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they want someone else because they don’t think Biden can win in 2024, up from 18% in a poll conducted in January and February. Thirty-two percent feel that way because they don’t want Biden to be reelected, up from 16% earlier this year. Twenty-five percent said they prefer Biden as the nominee, which is a steep drop from 45% in January/February.\n\nThe poll shows a sharp downturn in enthusiasm for a 2024 reelection bid by the President. In January/February, 51% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they wanted someone other than Biden to be the Democratic nominee in 2024.\n\nThe new poll shows 31% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters 45 years and older would prefer Biden to be the 2024 nominee.\n\nAmong Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters under 45, just 18% prefer Biden as the 2024 nominee.\n\nThe poll also showed a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say they do not want former President Donald Trump to be their party’s nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Fifty-five percent say they want someone else other than Trump to be the nominee, which is up from 49% in a January/February poll.\n\nThe Biden administration is struggling to get a handle on inflation that has risen to 40-year highs and left millions of Americans struggling with high prices of essentials like food, housing and gas. The spike in prices comes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic upending key global supply chains and Russia’s war on Ukraine further affecting oil and food prices.\n\nBiden’s approval rating remains in the 30s, according to a separate CNN poll released earlier this month, and Democrats are bracing for losses in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe CNN poll was released the same day as a new Granite State Poll from the University of New Hampshire that shows just 31% of New Hampshire Democrats want Biden to run for reelection and that 59 do not want him to run again. In June, 54% of New Hampshire Democrats said they did not want him to run again.\n\nThis CNN poll was conducted July 22 to July 24 by SSRS online, using sample drawn from a probability-based panel.

Raphael Warnock of Georgia holds a narrow lead over Republican challenger Herschel Walker among those likely to vote in a runoff election Tuesday, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nThe survey shows that Walker faces widespread questions about his honesty and suffers from a negative favorability rating, while nearly half of those who back him say their vote is more about opposition to Warnock than support for Walker. Voters’ modestly more positive views of Warnock and a firmly committed base of supporters appear to boost the incumbent in the new poll.\n\nOverall, 52% of likely voters say they plan to support Warnock in Tuesday’s runoff and 48% pick Walker. Partisans on both sides are deeply entrenched, with nearly all Democrats (99%) behind Warnock and 95% of Republicans backing Walker. Independents break in Warnock’s favor, 61% to 36%, but make up a relatively small slice of likely voters, 17%, compared with 24% in a CNN exit poll of voters in the first round of this contest last month. (Warnock finished narrowly ahead of Walker in November but without the majority of the vote needed to avoid a runoff.)\n\nWhite voters remain broadly behind Walker ahead of Tuesday’s election: 69% support him, with 30% backing Warnock, in the new poll, while Black voters likely to cast a ballot next week are near unanimous in their support for the Democrat (96% Warnock to 3% Walker). Those divides are similar to the racial split in the 2021 runoff during which Warnock initially won his seat, when 93% of Black voters backed him while 71% of White voters favored his Republican opponent, then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to CNN’s exit poll.\n\nThere is also a wide age gap in the upcoming contest, with voters under 35 sharply behind Warnock (74% to 25%), while those 65 or older break in Walker’s favor by 26 points (63% to 37%). Younger White voters are far more closely divided than older White voters (52% Walker to 48% Warnock among White voters younger than 45, while 75% of White voters age 45 or older say they back Walker). Support for Warnock is about the same among younger and older Black voters.\n\nWhite voters without college degrees are heavily behind Walker – 83% support him – while White voters with four-year degrees are closely divided, 51% Walker to 47% Warnock. White women with degrees tilt toward Warnock (53% Warnock to 44% for Walker) while White men with degrees break in Walker’s favor (58% Walker to 42% Warnock).\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Obama mocks Herschel Walker's vampire remark 01:42 - Source: CNN\n\nWarnock’s supporters broadly say they are casting ballots to support their candidate (83%) rather than to oppose Walker (17%), but it’s a more mixed bag among those who favor Walker (52% say their vote is more to support him, 47% to oppose Warnock).\n\nThat difference, the poll suggests, could be a factor in driving turnout. The runoff between Warnock and Walker is the only race on the ballot in most of the state, and voters who say they are voting more to support their Senate candidate than to oppose the other candidate express deeper motivation to vote – 79% of likely voters who say their vote is to support their chosen candidate are extremely motivated to vote, compared with 69% among those who say their vote is more one of opposition.\n\nThere are several indications in the poll that negative views of Walker are also a potential drag on his chances.\n\nBeyond the gap in affirmative support behind each man’s candidacy, there’s a big difference in views of Warnock and Walker personally. Views of Warnock tilt narrowly positive, with 50% of likely voters holding a favorable opinion, 45% unfavorable, while far more likely Georgia voters have a negative view of Walker (52%) than a positive one (39%).\n\nA broad majority say that Walker is not honest and trustworthy – 59% feel that way, including 18% of those who say they plan to vote for the Republican. A narrow majority, 52%, say they believe Warnock is honest and trustworthy, and views of his honesty are closely connected to vote choice (93% of Warnock’s own voters say he is honest, 91% of Walker’s voters say Warnock is not honest). Walker holds a wide lead among those likely voters who say that neither Walker nor Warnock are honest and trustworthy (they break 71% Walker to 27% Warnock).\n\nLikely voters are more apt to see Warnock than Walker as well qualified to serve as senator (52% say that describes Warnock better, 27% Walker, and 21% say neither is well qualified); as someone who would represent Georgia effectively in Congress (50% Warnock, 41% Walker, 8% neither); as someone who has good judgment (50% Warnock, 33% Walker, 17% neither); and as someone who has the right priorities (49% Warnock, 43% Walker, 7% neither). Among the roughly 1 in 5 likely voters who say neither candidate is well-qualified, about 9 in 10 back Walker (92%), and he wins roughly 8 in 10 of those who say neither candidate has good judgment (82% say they’ll vote for Walker).\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why Georgia's GOP lieutenant governor left runoff polling station without voting for either candidate 01:33 - Source: CNN\n\nStill, when asked directly whether their votes are more about the candidates’ positions on the issues or their character and integrity, 57% of likely voters say issues are the more important factor and 42% choose character and integrity. Among those saying that the issues are their main concern, 64% are voting for Walker; on the character side, 74% favor Warnock.\n\nNearly half of likely voters say the economy is their top issue in this runoff contest (46%), while 17% say voting rights and election integrity is their top concern and 16% choose abortion as their top issue. Walker holds 68% support among economy-focused voters, while broad majorities of both those who called elections and voting their top issue (79%) and those most concerned with abortion (78%) back Warnock.\n\nAbout half of likely voters (48%) say that abortion should be legal under most circumstances (37% say it should be legal under any circumstances, 11% in most circumstances), while 52% say it ought to be either legal in only a few circumstances (39%) or illegal in all circumstances (13%). The issue sharply divides the electorate: Those voters who feel it should be legal in most or all cases break heavily in Warnock’s favor, 88% for him vs. 11% for Walker, while those who say it should be legal in only a few cases or illegal in all circumstances are broadly behind Walker – 82% back him to 18% who favor Warnock.\n\nAfter an extended legal battle over when early voting would be allowed in the run-up to the runoff election, likely Georgia voters largely feel that the rules around voting in the runoff were about right. About 1 in 5 say they thought the rules made it too hard to vote (21%), a smaller share say it was too easy (14%) and around two-thirds say the rules were about right (66%). Liberals (47%), voters who considered voting rights and election integrity a top issue (39%) and Democrats (38%) were among the most likely to say the rules made it too hard to vote.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s approval rating in the new poll stands at 42% approve to 57% disapprove, about the same as in the November CNN exit poll among Georgia voters who cast ballots in the first round of this Senate race (41% approved, 58% disapproved). But both Biden and his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, are viewed negatively in Georgia. In the new poll, 41% hold a favorable view of Biden and 52% an unfavorable one, while views of Trump split 39% favorable to 54% unfavorable.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 25-29 in Georgia, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources – a probability-based online panel and a registration-based sample – and combined. Respondents were initially contacted by mail, phone or email. Results among the full sample of 1,886 registered voters has an error margin of plus or minus 3 points.

CNN Weather\n\nHurricane watches, meanwhile, are in effect for the US Virgin Islands as well as parts of the Dominican Republic, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona, having pelted Guadeloupe and other northeastern Caribbean islands with heavy rain and winds Friday and early Saturday, was centered over the Caribbean about 75 miles south of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands as of 8 p.m. ET Saturday, the hurricane center said.\n\nParts of the Leeward Islands had seen “very heavy rains and flooding,” the hurricane center said Saturday, adding one station in the mountains in southwestern Guadeloupe had recently measured 19.85 inches of rainfall in 24 hours. And a station at Teagues Bay, St. Croix, reported a wind gust of 45 mph, the center said Saturday night.\n\nThe storm had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph Saturday night, short of the 74 mph threshold for a Category 1 hurricane, though strengthening is expected as the weekend progresses.\n\nOuter bands already were hitting the Virgin Islands and parts of Puerto Rico since Saturday afternoon, causing some showers and storms.

Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states and all of the eastern seaboard, causing an estimated $78.7 billion in damage.\n\nFiona was about 1,200 miles southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Thursday morning, and the area is already bracing for a rare and historic impact.\n\n“Please take it seriously because we are seeing meteorological numbers in our weather maps that are rarely seen here,” said Fogarty.\n\nLohr, with the emergency management office in Nova Scotia, said the storm has the potential to be “very dangerous” for the province.\n\n“The storm is expected to bring severe and damaging wind gusts, very high waves, and coastal storm surges, intense and dangerous rainfall rates and prolonged power outages,” Lohr said Thursday. “The time to get ready is now before Fiona hits tomorrow evening.”\n\nThe lowest pressure ever recorded in Canada was 940 millibars in January 1977 in Newfoundland, said Brian Tang, an atmospheric science professor at the University of Albany. “Current weather forecast models are indicating that Fiona will make landfall in eastern Nova Scotia with a pressure around 925 to 935 millibars, which would easily set a new record,” he said.\n\nA pressure 920 to 944 millibars is typically found in a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nMany forecasters, including Fogarty, are comparing this storm to 2003’s Hurricane Juan, which battered the Canadian coast as a Category 2 storm.\n\n“That storm was much smaller. This one is huge,” said Fogarty.\n\nThe storm’s hurricane force winds extend 70 miles in either direction from its center – and tropical storm-force winds extend more than 200 miles. A path 140 miles wide could experience hurricane-force winds, and an area more than 400 miles across could experience tropical storm-force winds.\n\nAnd Fiona could grow even more by the time the storm reaches Canada, according to Tang.\n\nWhat Fiona could bring\n\nFiona is expected to reach Atlantic Canada on Friday evening, and the region will begin to experience deteriorating conditions earlier in the day.\n\nHere is the latest update on #Hurricane #Fiona.\n\n\n\nHurricane Fiona has the potential to be a landmark weather event in Eastern Canada this weekend, and we encourage the public to continue to monitor the forecasts regularly.\n\n\n\nRead the new bulletins at: https://t.co/QURfkCQp7W pic.twitter.com/RSdj9L75RI — ECCC Canadian Hurricane Centre (@ECCC_CHC) September 22, 2022\n\n“Fiona is purely a hurricane right now. As it begins to interact with a cold weather system and jet stream, it will transition into a superstorm with characteristics of both a strong hurricane and a strong autumn cyclone with hurricane-force winds, very heavy rain, and large storm surge and waves,” explained Tang.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is forecasting the storm “to continue producing hurricane-force winds as it crosses Nova Scotia and moves into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.” In fact, the storm could still carry winds over 100 mph when it slams onshore.\n\nNova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and western Newfoundland could receive up to 6 inches of rain, with some areas receiving up to 10 inches. This could result in significant flash flooding.\n\n“We want people to take it very seriously and be prepared for a long period of utility outages and structural damage to buildings,” explained Fogarty.\n\nLife-threatening storm surge and large waves are forecast for the region.\n\nMike Savage, the mayor of Halifax Regional Municipality, the capital of Nova Scotia, warned wave watchers and surfers to stay away from coastal areas, adding people who live near the coast “must be prepared to move on short notice and pay close attention to possible evacuation orders.”\n\n“Throughout our entire Halifax region you should be prepared for downed trees, extended power outages and local flood conditions,” the mayor added.\n\nCape Breton Regional Municipality Mayor Amanda McDougall said officials are preparing and working to ensure residents will be safe, as the area is in “the direct impact zone.”\n\n“We need to make sure that there’s going to be a center for people to go to prior to the storm because we know that there are different types of housing that are not going to be able to withstand the winds, the flooding, the way other buildings may,” McDougall said.\n\nHow to prepare for a hurricane\n\nSome of the waves over eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence could be higher than 39 feet, and the western Gulf will see waves from the north up to 26 feet in places, which will probably cause significant erosion on north facing beaches of Prince Edward Island, the Canadian hurricane center said.\n\nThe hurricane center also warns of coastal flooding, especially during high tide.\n\nIt’s been roughly 50 years since a storm this intense has impacted Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. Both of those were winter storms – in 1974 and 1976, Fogarty said.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA previously unknown dinosaur with a remarkably flat head lived around 70 million years ago on an island home to dwarfed prehistoric creatures.\n\nDiscovered in what’s now western Romania, the Transylvanosaurus platycephalus (flatheaded reptile from Transylvania) was 2 meters (6 feet) long — a relatively small size for a dinosaur, according to a new study. Its skull bones were unearthed in 2007 in a riverbed of the Haţeg Basin.\n\nIn the Cretaceous Period, this region of Romania was a tropical archipelago. Dinosaurs living there were smaller than their relatives elsewhere; paleontologists think these dinosaurs were an example of what biologists call “island rule,” where large animals isolated on islands become dwarfed or stunted in their growth over time and small animals become larger.\n\nSauropods, the largest type of dinosaurs that have ever lived, reached average heights of a puny 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) on the archipelago, for example, compared with 15 to 20 meters (49.2 to 65.6 feet) typical for the group.\n\nHowever, the mechanism that gives rise to such changes isn’t fully understood but could be linked to a shortage of resources.\n\nThe dinosaur’s bones were able to survive for tens of millions of years because the sediments of an ancient riverbed protected them.\n\n“If the dinosaur had died and simply lain on the ground instead of being partly buried, weather and scavengers would soon have destroyed all of its bones and we would never have learned about it,” study coauthor Felix Augustin, a paleontologist and doctoral student at the University of Tübingen in Germany, said in a news release.\n\nThe dinosaur's flat head was its most unusual feature. Felix Augustin/Peter Nickolaus/Dylan Bastiaans\n\nNone of the bones the researchers uncovered was longer than 12 centimeters (about 5 inches), but they revealed a remarkable amount of detail about the little plant-eating dino that would have walked on two legs and had a powerful, thick tail. It was possible to discern the contours of the brain of Transylvanosaurus, the research team said.\n\n“We were able to see the impressions, and thus the proportions, of different brain sections — more specifically, of the olfactory bulbs (the brain section responsible for the sense of smell) and the cerebrum, which serves several different functions from sensory processing to memory,” Augustin said via email.\n\n“The next step would be to compare the proportions of the brain and eye to other related species, as this may give information on what senses were important to Transylvanosaurus,” he added.\n\nThe Haţeg Basin has been a hotbed for dinosaur discoveries. Ten dinosaur species have already been identified during excavations in the region, with the first dinosaur discovered in 1900. The Transylvanosaurus platycephalus is the first new dinosaur species to be discovered there in 10 years after a small carnivore and long-necked plant eater were found in 2010, Augustin said.\n\nTransylvanosaurus was a plant eater and part of a family of dinosaurs known as Rhabdodontidae that were common during the Late Cretaceous Period. Its head was far wider than other Rhabdodontidae species, the study said.\n\nPrecisely how the Transylvanosaurus ended up in the eastern part of what was the European archipelago remains unclear.\n\nResearchers believe this type of dinosaur could have originated in what’s now France, where fossils of its nearest relatives have been found, and somehow made it to the region — perhaps by swimming, or due to fluctuations in sea level or tectonic processes that created a land bridge.\n\n“They had powerful legs and a powerful tail,” Augustin said of the Transylvanosaurus. “Most species, in particular reptiles, can swim from birth.”\n\nAnother possibility is that various lines of rhabdodontid species evolved in parallel in Eastern and Western Europe.\n\nRegardless of its geographic origins, the newly discovered species helps disprove assumptions that there was a low diversity of dinosaurs and other fauna in the Late Creaceous Period, the researchers said. As well as the dwarf dinosaurs, the Haţeg Basin was also home to crocodiles, giant pterosaurs (flying reptiles) and turtles — before dinosaurs went extinct 66 milion years ago.\n\n“Almost every terrestrial animal on this island was pretty small,” Augustin said via email. “An exception were the pterosaurs, some of which reached gigantic body sizes — the reason for this is probably that they could fly and thus were not as severely impacted by the limited resources on the island.”\n\nThe research was published November 23 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/asia/tonga-volcano-tsunami-recovery-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Tonga faces 'unprecedented disaster' as New Zealand warns of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA massive volcanic eruption and tsunami near Tonga caused “an unprecedented disaster,” the Pacific nation’s leader said Tuesday, as New Zealand warned of further eruptions that may complicate the delivery of aid to remote islands where communications are down.\n\nIn its first official update since Saturday’s eruption of the underwater Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano, Tonga’s government on Tuesday confirmed the deaths of three people and several other injuries, and outlined the scale of destruction to communities.\n\nTongan Prime Minster Siaosi Sovaleni said all houses on the island of Mango, where 36 people live, were destroyed. Only two houses remain on Fonoifua island, and extensive damage was reported on Nomuka island, home to 239 people, he said.\n\n“An unprecedented disaster hit Tonga,” Sovaleni said, adding a “volcanic mushroom plume” extended to cover all of the country’s roughly 170 islands – of which 36 are inhabited – impacting the entire population of more than 100,000 people.\n\nLarge swaths of land in Tonga are covered in volcanic ash, in this photo taken January 17, 2022.

No evacuation centers are open on the main island, and people who were displaced are mostly staying with extended families.\n\nOn ‘Eua, 89 people are in evacuation centers, the spokesperson said, adding that information from outer islands remains scarce.\n\nRace to deliver aid to Tonga\n\nThe first details of the devastation emerged on Tuesday after Tonga’s Pacific neighbors, Australia and New Zealand, made reconnaissance flights to the archipelago – a three- to five-hour journey.\n\nPhotos show entire island communities that were once lush and green, now blanketed by thick, gray ash. Many homes appear damaged or completely destroyed.\n\nWidespread stagnant pools of salt water, coupled with the volcanic ash, are polluting drinking water sources, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThe delivery of aid was hampered by ashfall covering Tonga’s Fua’amotu International Airport runway, forcing New Zealand to send two navy ships to assist with recovery – but they will not arrive until Friday.\n\nYutaro Setoya, the official in charge of the WHO liaison office for Tonga, said he believed the first aid flights could arrive on Thursday.\n\nHe also described the the conditions in the wake of the disaster.\n\n“After the eruption initially, there was a sound on the roof like rain, and it was not actually a rain. It was small pellets falling from the sky,” Setoya told CNN on Wednesday. The pellets were followed by very fine ash, which by the time Tonga woke up the next day resembled “gray snow like two centimeters everywhere.”\n\nWith cleanup efforts underway, rescue workers are racing to deliver safe drinking water to the island nation as it grapples with the shortages.\n\n“Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority,” said Katie Greenwood, the Pacific Head of Delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, pointing to the mounting risk of diarrhea and diseases such as cholera.\n\nAn area of Nukuʻalofa is pictured under a layer of volcanic ash on Wednesday.

But it knows all about you.\n\nChances are, it’s living inside you right now. About 95% of American adults are infected sometime in their lives. And once infected, the virus stays with you.\n\nMost viruses, such as influenza, just come and go. A healthy immune system attacks them, kills them, and prevents them from sickening you again. Epstein-Barr and its cousins, including the viruses that cause chickenpox and herpes, can hibernate inside your cells for decades.\n\nThis viral family has “evolved with us for millions of years,” said Blossom Damania, a virologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. “They know all your body’s secrets.”\n\nAlthough childhood Epstein-Barr infections are typically mild, exposure in teens and young adults can lead to infectious mononucleosis, a weeks-long illness that sickens 125,000 Americans a year, causing sore throats, swollen glands, and extreme fatigue. And while Epstein-Barr spends most of its time sleeping, it can reawaken during times of stress or when the immune system is off its game. Those reactivations are linked to a long list of serious health conditions, including several types of cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nScientists have spent years trying to develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr, or EBV. But recently several leaps in medical research have provided more urgency to the quest — and more hope for success. In just the past year, two experimental vaccine efforts have made it to human clinical trials.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nFirst, the Epstein-Barr virus has been shown to present an even greater threat. New research firmly links it to multiple sclerosis, or MS, a potentially disabling chronic disease that afflicts more than 900,000 Americans and 2.8 million people worldwide.\n\nThe journal Science in January published results from a landmark 20-year study of 10 million military personnel that offers the strongest evidence yet that Epstein-Barr can trigger MS. The new study found that people infected with Epstein-Barr are 32 times as likely as people not infected to develop MS.\n\nAnd shedding new light on the mechanisms that could explain that correlation, a separate group of scientists published a study in Nature describing how the virus can cause an autoimmune reaction that leads to MS. The disease, which usually strikes between ages 20 and 40, disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is often marked by recurring episodes of extreme fatigue, blurred vision, muscle weakness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. At its worst, MS can lead to impaired speech and paralysis.\n\nAmplifying that newfound urgency, several new studies suggest that reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus also is involved with some cases of long covid, a little-understood condition in which patients experience lingering symptoms that often resemble mononucleosis.\n\nAnd just as crucial to the momentum: Advances in vaccine science spurred by the pandemic, including the mRNA technology used in some covid vaccines, could accelerate development of other vaccines, including ones against Epstein-Barr, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Hotez co-created a low-cost, patent-free covid vaccine called Corbevax.\n\nSome researchers question the need for a vaccine that targets a disease like MS that, while debilitating, remains relatively rare.\n\nEliminating Epstein-Barr would require vaccinating all healthy children even though their risk of developing cancer or multiple sclerosis is small, said Dr. Ralph Horwitz, a professor at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University.\n\nBefore exposing children to the potential risks of a new vaccine, he said, scientists need to answer basic questions about MS. For example, why does a virus that affects nearly everyone cause disease in a small fraction? And what roles do stress and other environmental conditions play in that equation?\n\nThe answer appears to be that Epstein-Barr is “necessary but not sufficient” to cause disease, said immunologist Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National MS Society, adding that the virus “may be the first in a string of dominoes.”\n\nHotez said researchers could continue to probe the mysteries surrounding Epstein-Barr and MS even as the vaccine efforts proceed. Further study is required to understand which populations might benefit most from a vaccine, and once more is known, Hotez said, such a vaccine possibly could be used in patients found to be at highest risk, such as organ transplant recipients, rather than administered universally to all young people.\n\n“Now that we know that Epstein-Barr is very tightly linked to MS, we could save a lot of lives if we develop the vaccine now,” Damania said, “rather than wait 10 years” until every question is answered.\n\nModerna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched separate clinical trials of Epstein-Barr vaccines over the past year. Epstein-Barr vaccines also are in early stages of testing at Opko Health, a Miami-based biotech company; Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; and California’s City of Hope National Medical Center.\n\nScientists have sought to develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr for decades only to be thwarted by the complexities of the virus. Epstein-Barr “is a master of evading the immune system,” said Dr. Jessica Durkee-Shock, a clinical immunologist and principal investigator for NIAID’s trial.\n\nBoth MS and the cancers linked to Epstein-Barr develop many years after people are infected. So a trial designed to learn whether a vaccine can prevent these diseases would take decades and a lot of money.\n\nModerna researchers initially are focusing on a goal more easily measured: the prevention of mononucleosis, which doubles the risk of multiple sclerosis. Mono develops only a month or so after people are infected with Epstein-Barr, so scientists won’t have to wait as long for results.\n\nMono can be incredibly disruptive on its own, keeping students out of class and military recruits out of training for weeks. In about 10% of cases, the crippling fatigue lasts six months or more. In 1% of cases, patients develop complications, including hepatitis and neurological problems.\n\nFor now, the clinical trials for Epstein-Barr immunizations are enrolling only adults. “In the future, the perfect vaccine would be given to a small child,” Durkee-Shock said. “And it would protect them their whole life, and prevent them from getting mono or any other complication from the Epstein-Barr virus.”\n\nThe NIAID vaccine, being tested for safety in 40 volunteers, is built around ferritin, an iron-storage protein that can be manipulated to display a key viral protein to the immune system. Like a cartoon Transformer, the ferritin nanoparticle self-assembles into what looks like a “little iron soccer ball,” Durkee-Shock said. “This approach, in which many copies of the EBV protein are displayed on a single particle, has proved successful for other vaccines, including the HPV and hepatitis B vaccine.”\n\nModerna’s experimental vaccine, being tested in about 270 people, works more like the company’s covid shot. Both deliver snippets of a virus’s genetic information in molecules called mRNA inside a lipid nanoparticle, or tiny bubble of fat. Moderna, which has dozens of mRNA vaccines in development, hopes to learn from each and apply those lessons to Epstein-Barr, said Sumana Chandramouli, senior director and research program leader for infectious diseases at Moderna.\n\n“What the covid vaccine has shown us is that the mRNA technology is well tolerated, very safe, and highly efficacious,” Chandramouli said.\n\nBut mRNA vaccines have limitations.\n\nAlthough they have saved millions of lives during the covid pandemic, the antibody levels generated in response to the mRNA vaccines wane after a few months. It’s possible this rapid loss of antibodies is related specifically to the coronavirus and its rapidly evolving new strains, Hotez said. But if waning immunity is inherent in the mRNA technology, that could seriously limit future vaccines.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDesigning vaccines against Epstein-Barr is also more complicated than for covid. The Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses are comparatively huge, four to five times as large as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes covid. And while the coronavirus uses just one protein to infect human cells, the Epstein-Barr virus uses many, four of which are included in the Moderna vaccine.\n\nEarlier experimental Epstein-Barr vaccines targeting one viral protein lowered the rate of infectious mononucleosis but failed to prevent viral infection. Targeting multiple viral proteins may be more effective at preventing infection, said Damania, the UNC virologist.\n\n“If you close one door, the other door is still open,” Damania said. “You have to block infection in all cell types to have a successful vaccine that prevents future infections.”", "authors": ["Liz Szabo"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/us/hurricane-ian-florida-recovery-monday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian: Death toll surpasses 100 as the search for survivors ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe number of people killed in Florida by Hurricane Ian rose to at least 101 on Monday, days after the storm made landfall at Category 4 strength, decimating coastal towns and leaving rescue crews searching for survivors while communities face the daunting task of rebuilding.\n\nAt least 54 people died in Lee County alone, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said Monday – up from the county’s previously announced death toll of 42 – and officials there are facing questions about whether evacuation orders should have been issued earlier. Twenty-four deaths were recorded in Charlotte County – up from 12.\n\nHurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of eight people in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County and one each in Lake, Hardee, Hendry, Hillsborough and Polk counties, officials said. Four other people died in storm-related incidents as Ian churned into North Carolina.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have been rescued from Hurricane Ian’s path in parts of southwest and central Florida since last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said Sunday.\n\nNow, as blue skies return, Floridians who took shelter while the hurricane raged have emerged – many of them still without power or clean drinking water – to find their communities unrecognizable.\n\nMore than 491,000 homes, businesses and other customers in Florida still did not have power as of Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us. In Fort Myers Beach, where search crews are going through the rubble one house at a time, power may not be restored for 30 days due its electrical infrastructure being destroyed, Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said.\n\nThe National Guard will be flying power crews to Sanibel and Pine islands to assess the damage and start working on restoring power, DeSantis said.\n\nMany residents are without clean tap water, with well over 100 boil-water advisories in places around the state, according to Florida Health Department data.\n\nLIVE UPDATES\n\nIn Naples, Hank DeWolf’s 4,000-pound boat dock was carried through a condo complex by the powerful hurricane, landing in his neighbor’s yard. And the water brought someone’s car into his own backyard. He doesn’t know who it belongs to or how to remove it.\n\nAs crews in Naples comb through the wreckage to make sure no one is still trapped, residents face the enormous task ahead of cleaning up and restoring the city, Jay Boodheshwar, city manager of Naples, told CNN.\n\n“People need to take care of their emotional and mental health, because we’re really going to need to work together on this,” Boodheshwar said.\n\nNaples received record-high storm surge, when the hurricane sent rising ocean water flooding into the city’s streets and tearing through its infrastructure.\n\n“The amount of water that we received and the height of the surge affected a lot of the infrastructure,” Boodheshwar said. “So there are transformers that are fried. It is not simply rehanging lines. There are things that may need to be replaced.”\n\nA man stands in front of a home damaged by storm surge in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Naples, Florida.

Hurricane Ian – expected to be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history – devastated neighborhoods from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nIn some cases, emergency workers out searching for signs of life are at the same time contending with losing their own homes.\n\n“Some of the guys on Pine Island, they lost everything, but they’re doing what they can,” said emergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who was preparing to join first responders on a rescue mission Sunday near decimated Sanibel Island and Pine Island.\n\nAnd the flooding isn’t over yet.\n\nSeminole County continues to experience significant flooding in certain neighborhoods, with families being rescued from waist-high waters over the weekend.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Cameraman rushes to help family during live report 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDays after the hurricane left, flooding continues to increase in areas near the St. Johns River, Lake Monroe, and Lake Harney, with an additional 100 homes suffering floodwater damage over the last 24 hours, Seminole County emergency management officials told CNN affiliate WESH.\n\nQuestions over timing of evacuation orders as deaths mount\n\nLee County officials have faced criticism about why the first mandatory evacuations weren’t ordered until a day before Ian’s landfall, despite an emergency plan which suggests evacuations should have happened earlier.\n\nDeSantis has said Lee County officials acted appropriately when they issued their first mandatory evacuations on Tuesday, less than 24 hours before Hurricane Ian made landfall on the barrier island Cayo Costa, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDesjarlais said the county made the decision to evacuate at the earliest time possible.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that so many people chose not to evacuate,” he said. “You know, I think I told you the other day we had room for 40,000 people in our shelters, but only 4,000 showed up, which means that people made the conscious choice not to evacuate, and it is regretful and you know, no one feels worse than we do about all that.”\n\nBut people are “used to longer evacuation orders,” Shawn Critser, a pastor in Fort Myers Beach, told CNN Monday. “But we got it the day before.”\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, Critser believed – like many others – that the heaviest impacts would be felt farther to the north, near Tampa Bay. But then the forecast was revised, showing the storm’s track shifting to the south.\n\n“When that evacuation order came, we’re like, ’24 hours, that’s not a lot. But we’ll still kind of make it,’” Critser said. “And it wasn’t until Wednesday morning when we woke up and saw that it had made another adjustment. And at that point, it’s just too late.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Miracle': Captain tells incredible story about his boat during Hurricane Ian 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\nSheriff Marceno stood by the handling of the evacuation orders Monday, saying he was “confident in our county manager, our leaders, our governor, all of us in law enforcement that we got that message out at the right time.”\n\nHard-hit Sanibel Island will be ‘out of commission’\n\nHurricane Ian wiped away parts of the Sanibel Causeway, which connects Sanibel Island to the mainland, stranding residents as their only link became impassable.\n\nSearch and rescue personnel have been going door-to-door searching properties for anyone who may need to be evacuated, and nearly 100 members of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue continue to conduct rescue efforts along Southwest Florida’s Barrier Islands like Sanibel, Captiva and Pine Island.\n\nThe fire rescue team is helping evacuate residents, dispensing medicine, treating injuries, helping people get in touch with family and just providing hard-to-come-by information, said Capt. Michelle Steele, a medical specialist.\n\n“People aren’t getting a whole lot of information right now. So whatever we can offer, that’s what we’re here for,” Steele said.\n\nA man along with his dog prepares to be evacuated in a Florida Army National Guard helicopter in Pine Island, Florida.

It wasn’t. God is good. We made it out alive,” Lynn wrote on Facebook. “We lost everything. My car is gone. I haven’t seen my home on Sanibel. I’ve been told it’s destroyed.”\n\nLynn was thankful to be alive, but, she wrote, “This is so much more than devastating. The heart of the (Southwest Florida) coast is forever changed.”\n\nAuthorities will allow residents to return Wednesday by private boat but said they should look online first. Sanibel officials plan to post photos and information on whether the property is deemed destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe bridge to Pine Island was knocked out by the storm and the transportationdepartment hopes to have a temporary bridge in place by the end of the week, the governor said Monday.\n\n“This is not necessarily going to be a bridge you’re going to want to go 45 miles per an hour over, maybe, but at least you’ll have connectivity to the mainland,” DeSantis said.\n\nOfficials said food is being dropped at fire stations on Pine Island.\n\nPower could be out for weeks\n\nSome residents and businesses in storm-damaged counties may not be back on the grid for “weeks or months” because of the structural damage caused by the hurricane, said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company.\n\nFPL expects to have power restored by Sunday to 95% of its 126,700 customers in Charlotte County, which includes Punta Gorda, Patrick Fuller, the county emergency management director said Monday.

In addition, there will be little relief during overnight hours.\n\n“Even after the sun goes down, heat can be a real danger – especially in large cities.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNear the summit of Costa Rica’s Poás volcano is one of Earth’s most acidic lakes, bright blue and full of toxic metals.\n\nThe harsh conditions of Laguna Caliente, where temperatures can fluctuate between 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) and 194 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius), are where a few lucky scientists go to learn more about Mars.\n\nFrequent phreatic eruptions occur when groundwater is heated by volcanic activity, releasing explosions of ash, rock and steam.\n\nYet microbes have found a way to live in this environment, one of the most hostile on our planet, according to multiple studies of the lake and new research published last week in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences.\n\nAlthough the diversity of the life in this lake isn’t high, it has managed to adapt and persist in a multitude of ways.\n\nToxic, stinging steam surrounds the lake and volcano. courtesy Justin Wang\n\n“Our finding shows that life persists in the most extreme environments on Earth,” said study author Justin Wang, graduate student and research assistant at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine something more hostile to life than an ultra-acidic volcanic lake with frequent eruptions,” Wang said. “The low biodiversity coupled with numerous adaptations and metabolisms in our sample suggests the lake hosts highly specialized microbes for this kind of environment.”\n\nThis otherworldly environment could suggest how life might have existed on Mars billions of years ago and reveal new places to search for evidence of ancient life on the red planet, according to the researchers.\n\nA tale of two lakes\n\nThe two crater lakes near the volcano’s summit, both formed after craters filled with rainwater, couldn’t be more different from each other. One inactive crater holds Botos lake, which is surrounded by tropical vegetation. The active crater is home to Laguna Caliente, which contains liquid sulfur and iron. Gases from the lake create acid rain and acid fog, harming nearby ecosystems and irritating the eyes and lungs of intrepid explorers.\n\nResearchers conducted active field studies at the lake in 2013, 2017 and 2019. While the results from the 2019 excursion are still pending, it’s a trip Wang will never forget.\n\nPoás volcano, located in the middle of the Costa Rican rainforest, erupted most recently in 2017 and 2019. The area immediately around the volcano is devoid of life due to the toxic gases it releases.\n\nWang and his collaborators hiked to the volcano in November, a month after the crater lake reformed. They were mindful of where they stepped in the loose soil caused by acidity breaking down the surface material. Parts of the lake boiled and volcanic openings called fumaroles belched out hot sulfurous gases.\n\nJustin Wang stands adjacent to fumaroles in the crater during field research in 2019. courtesy Justin Wang\n\n“When I went to the Poás Volcano, it was after over a year of magmatic eruptions and only a month after the lake reformed and it was deemed safe enough to return to the crater lake’s surface,” Wang said. “The lake itself is roiling and dynamic. As you get even closer, you can smell the strong stench of sulfur, which has remained on the clothes I was wearing to this day. Even worse is the smell of hydrochloric acid, which tastes sour in the air and stings the eyes.”\n\nSurrounding the lake are puddles of boiling water and acid, and Wang felt the volcano’s heat through the bottoms of his shoes near the lake shore.\n\nThe researchers collected samples from the lake, just as they had in 2013 and 2017.\n\n“It is a very intense and thrilling experience to sample from the lake,” Wang said. “I’m very lucky to be one of the handful of scientists in the world to have been able to visit this environment.”\n\nLiving on the edge\n\nIn 2013, the researchers determined that Acidiphilium bacteria lives in the lake. These microbes are often found in acid mine drainage as well as hydrothermal systems, like Laguna Caliente. Acidiphilium bacteria have multiple genes that allow them to adapt to survive across different environments.\n\nMore eruptions occurred at the site before the team returned in 2017. After gathering more samples, the researchers found that there was a little more biodiversity among the bacteria in the lake than expected. Additionally, their DNA sequencing revealed that the Acidiphilium bacteria has developed ways to convert elements like sulfur, iron and arsenic to create the energy needed to survive.\n\nToxic gases rise from the lake in 2019. courtesy Justin Wang\n\n“Between 2013 and 2017, there were numerous phreatic eruptions that influx toxic metals, extreme acidity, and heat to the lake, but nevertheless we saw some of the same microorganisms in the same environment,” Wang said.\n\nAbout a month after the team collected samples from the lake in March 2017, the Poás volcano erupted with magma. The force of the explosion hurtled rocks over a mile away from the site, spewed lava, drained the crater lake and released an ash plume about 12,000 feet above the crater multiple times, said study coauthor Geoffroy Avard, volcanologist at the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica.\n\n“We would like to characterize how life reclaims this environment,” he said. “A main hypothesis from our study is that life in the Poás Volcano is able to survive on the fringes during these extreme environments. So we’d love to sample not only the crater lake but the shore line, connected groundwater systems, and anywhere where life might be harbored nearby.”\n\nThe search for life\n\nThe genetic adaptations discovered by Wang and his colleagues during their study suggests that life could have survived in hydrothermal environments on Mars much like it does in some of the most extreme places on Earth.\n\nHydrothermal systems provide heat, water and energy – all necessary for the formation and evolution of life. While previous Martian exploration has looked at ancient sources of water like craters and rivers, the researchers think that the sites of ancient hot springs are another key target in the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\n“These places are not hard to find since early Mars had rampant volcanism and abundant near-surface water,” said study coauthor Brian Hynek, associate professor at University of Colorado Boulder’s department of geological sciences and a research associate at the university’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, via email.\n\nResearchers will continue to collect samples from the lake to determine how environmental shifts impact life. courtesy Justin Wang\n\n“In fact, we have discovered many ‘dried up Yellowstones’ across Mars, based on sulfur-bearing mineral signatures detected from orbit,” he said.\n\nThe NASA Spirit rover even came across a volcanic vent when it explored Mars between 2004 and 2011, Hynek noted.\n\n“The crater rim of the Jezero Crater, where the Perseverance rover is now, is a place that likely exhibited hydrothermal activity due to the crater-forming impact that occurred, so I’d be curious to see what results Perseverance finds when it reaches there,” Wang said.\n\nResearch to understand the tiny organisms that live in extreme environments is changing how scientists regard the limits of life, whether it be within an active volcanic crater lake or along hot hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.\n\nWhile that helps researchers change the way they think about how life might exist within the hostile conditions on other planets, Wang warns that scientists shouldn’t be too “Earth-centric” in their approach. Life on Earth is usually found in the presence of water, but the existence of water on Mars was much more limited and episodic in the past, he said.\n\n“I think we need to change the way of how we think of life on other worlds,” Wang said. “We need to consider the unique geological histories of our extraterrestrial environments and put that in context with what we have here on Earth. If rivers were unstable on Mars while hot springs were common, then perhaps life in hydrothermal environments is the most likely place where life could have existed.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/weather/hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico-dominican-republic-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Fiona reaches Category 4 as it moves north, leaving ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith Category 4 Hurricane Fiona poised to sideswipe Bermuda later this week, people in the storm’s deadly wake still faced days without basic utilities late Wednesday – including much of Puerto Rico, where most were left without power and running water.\n\nMore than a million people in Puerto Rico still had no power by Wednesday afternoon, according to the island’s emergency portal system. And more than 450,000 people across the island were without water service or with intermittent service as of Wednesday night, according to the website.\n\nWater is the top concern for residents like Carlos Vega, whose town of Cayey in the mountains of east-central Puerto Rico faced not only utility outages but also partially collapsed roads – an effect of the major flooding and more than 2 feet of rain that parts of Puerto Rico were hit with.\n\n“(Being without) power … we can face that and we can deal with that.

Juan Méndez García, director of the country’s emergency operations center.\n\nMeanwhile, parts of Puerto Rico, where hundreds of thousands remained without power, reached heat indices – what the air feels like when combining temperature and humidity – of 105 to 109 degrees Wednesday, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Shackelford.\n\nThe landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday came nearly five years after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, leaving thousands dead and cutting power to and water service to more than 1 million people for what would become months.\n\nStorm presses north and could threaten Bermuda and Atlantic Canada\n\nFiona, after its center passed the Turks and Caicos as a Category 3 storm, strengthened to Category 4 – sustained winds of at least 130 mph – early Wednesday over the Atlantic.\n\nBy around 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, it was centered about 605 miles southwest of Bermuda, heading north with sustained winds of 130 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona is expected to strengthen some through Wednesday night and approach Bermuda late Thursday, potentially still as a Category 4 storm, forecasters said.\n\n“Fiona is forecast to be a hurricane-force cyclone through Saturday,” the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona’s powerful center is currently expected to pass west of Bermuda, sparing the British island territory its worst winds. But sustained winds of at least tropical-storm force – 39 to 73 mph – are expected to reach Bermuda by late Thursday or early Friday, the center said.\n\nThe US State Department issued a travel advisory Tuesday urging US citizens to reconsider travel to Bermuda because of the storm. The department also authorized family members of US government personnel to leave the island in anticipation of the storm.\n\nThough the storm isn’t expected to track near the US East Coast, it could generate onshore waves of 8 to 10 feet there over the weekend, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Wednesday.\n\n“It’s not a good weekend to go to the shore and get in the water – it’s time to stay out of the water,” Myers said of the East Coast.\n\nFiona could affect portions of Atlantic Canada as a powerful hurricane-force cyclone late Friday and Saturday, potentially hammering the region with high winds, storm surge and heavy rainfall. A storm surge is expected to bring up water levels along Bermuda’s coast starting late Thursday.\n\n“Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,” the hurricane center said.\n\nThe storm has strengthened over the past few days – it made landfall in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as a Category 1 hurricane before battering both with outer bands as it moved over water and toward the Turks and Caicos as a storm in Categories 2 and 3.\n\nNicasio Gil walks through the stagnant water left by the swollen Duey River while grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Higuey, Dominican Republic, on Tuesday, September 20.

Criswell arrived on Tuesday to determine what additional federal help is needed, and that day surveyed damage with the governor in the city of Patillas.\n\n“The community there … (had) severely impacted roads, and bridges were damaged. Water was flooding the streets, and … other parts of the community (were) inaccessible,” Criswell said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n“But I also saw a resilient Puerto Rico,” she said. “I met with a woman named Anna, who opened up her own home in her own driveway to help create a path for the community. With the bridge that was washed away, her home became that pathway to help give food and water to the rest of her community.”\n\nNational Guards direct traffic in Cayey, Puerto Rico, as resident Luis Noguera helps clear the road.

This figures to be one of the World Cup's more evenly-matched pools, with the Netherlands having made great strides in recent years and New Zealand possessing a tough unit capable of causing shocks.\n\nPredicted finishing order: 1. China 2. Canada 3. Netherlands 4. New Zealand\n\nGROUP B\n\nGermany, led by outgoing coach Silvia Neid, has not forgotten the pain of falling in the quarterfinal on home soil four years ago, a defeat which caused it to miss out on qualification for the Olympics. Ranked first in the world, they will be the team to beat, while Norway is always capable of an upset. For the Ivory Coast and especially Thailand the tournament will likely be a learning experience, possibly a painful one.\n\nPredicted finishing order: 1. Germany 2. Norway 3. Ivory Coast 4. Thailand\n\nGROUP C\n\nDefending champion Japan is an overwhelming favorite to win the group, but some conspiracy theorists have wondered whether unpredictable head coach Norio Sasaki might prefer to finish second – and get the more favorable rest schedule that comes with it. Switzerland is an emerging contender in Europe, while both Cameroon and Ecuador have made reaching the round of 16 a publicly stated target.\n\nPredicted finishing order: 1. Japan 2. Switzerland 3. Ecuador 4. Cameroon\n\nGROUP D\n\nThere have been some naysayers who cast gloomy aspersions on the United States' chances after it landed in the \"Group of Death\", but in reality the tough draw might be just what the side needs. A tricky opener against Australia should sharpen American minds before its toughest clash, against Sweden on June 12. The Swedes are led by former U.S. coach Pia Sundhage and are a class act, but no team in this group can be discounted.\n\nPredicted finishing order: 1. USA 2. Sweden 3. Australia 4. Nigeria\n\nGROUP E\n\nBrazil is the standout name in the group although South Korea, with its sound defense and Spain, with attacking flair and poise, could make things interesting. Costa Rica will likely be outmatched, although the other three teams all have the talent to reach the knockout stage — with ambitious Brazil and its superstar Marta confident of making a serious run at the title.\n\nPredicted finishing order: 1. Brazil 2. South Korea 3. Spain 4. Costa Rica\n\nGROUP F\n\nFrance is one of the most improved teams in soccer, a far better unit now even than the outfit that reached the semifinal four years ago and in the Olympics in 2012. England has been revitalized under a new coaching regime, while the best Colombia and Mexico can probably hope for is third place and a back-door route into the knockout phase.\n\nPredicted finishing order: 1. France 2. England 3. Colombia 4. Mexico\n\nROUND OF 16\n\nCalculating the knockout stage is fraught with danger, especially with the quirky scenario whereby four of the six third-placed teams qualify. This format benefits teams in groups containing the weakest opponent, even if they are also lumped in with one of the title favorites. A single group stage victory — for example if the Ivory Coast can beat up on underdog Thailand — could be enough to secure passage through to the knockouts.\n\nThe highlight of the round of 16, and the biggest likelihood of a big-name casualty, promises to be whoever finishes second in Group D (Sweden by our calculations), up against 2007 champ Brazil (assuming it wins Group E).\n\nPredictions:\n\nCanada beats Switzerland\n\nUnited States beats Colombia\n\nGermany beats Ecuador\n\nFrance beats South Korea\n\nSweden beats Brazil\n\nJapan beats Ivory Coast\n\nEngland beats Norway\n\nChina beats Spain\n\nQUARTERFINALS\n\nIf the tournament plays out as we predict then the quarterfinals will be nothing short of mouth-watering, especially the regional derby between the United States and Canada. That contest would be played in Ottawa but despite home advantage and having had two days' extra rest, Canada would likely find their neighbors from the south too strong.\n\nAnother regional battle between France and Germany would be high-quality fare, we are tipping the French to spring an upset and leave Germany broken-hearted for the second tournament in succession.\n\nUnited States beats Canada\n\nFrance beats Germany\n\nJapan beats Sweden\n\nEngland beats China\n\nSEMIFINALS\n\nThe U.S. met France at this juncture four years ago and looked unconvincing in stretches before pulling away to clinch victory in the second half.

Alexandra Popp seemed to position two-time champion Germany for a draw with an 89th-minute penalty.\n\nBut Vanegas' header in the 97th minute gave Colombia a World Cup upset.\n\nCOMEBACK\n\nNorway looked down and out after an opening game loss to co-host New Zealand and a goalless draw against Switzerland. With star player Ada Hegerberg injured, the odds were beginning to stack up against the Norwegians going into their final Group A match against the Philippines.\n\nBut three goals within 31 minutes set up a 6-0 rout that saw Norway advance to the knockout rounds in second place. The Norway win knocked New Zealand out of the tournament, making the Football Ferns the first host to be eliminated in group play in tournament history.\n\nEMERGING STARS\n\nCaicedo's standout performances aren't a surprise to those who have followed her career. The Real Madrid forward has long-been tipped to be one of the biggest stars in women's soccer.\n\nShe hasn't disappointed in her first World Cup and has inspired Colombia to back-to-back wins with goals in each game.\n\nEngland coach Sarina Wiegman unleashed Chelsea forward James from the start in the Lionesses' second game against Denmark, and she made a quick impression. Collecting the ball outside the area after six minutes, she swept a curling effort past Lene Christensen.\n\nHaiti's Melchie Dumornay has shown flashes of the talent that earned her a move to French powerhouse Lyon, while 19-year-old Aoba Fujino has become the youngest player to score at a World Cup for Japan's men's or women's teams.\n\nCasey Phair, a 16 year old, became the youngest-ever player to appear in a senior soccer World Cup when she was a second-half substitute for South Korea against Colombia.\n\nDISAPPOINTMENTS\n\nWhile youngsters have capitalized on their chance to shine, some of the established names have yet to make their mark.\n\nThere have been differing reasons for that.\n\nSam Kerr's calf injury robbed Australia of its star striker for its opening two games, while Hegerberg's groin injury has cut her playing time for Norway.\n\nAlex Morgan, who was the co-leading scorer at the last World Cup, is still finding her footing in the United States' new look attack.\n\nRecord international scorer Christine Sinclair was benched for Canada's second game and is still waiting for her first goal of the tournament, while Brazil great Marta has also been used sparingly.\n\nSURPRISES\n\nNew Zealand kicked the tournament off with a 1-0 win against Norway, but couldn't keep up its momentum and went on to lose by the same score to the Philippines to set up the co-host's early exit.\n\nJamaica's 0-0 draw with fifth-ranked France was described by its coach Lorne Donaldson as the country's greatest soccer result, for men or women. But the biggest surprise could be yet to come if Jamaica can avoid defeat against Brazil to advance to the round of 16.\n\nColombia's dramatic late winner against Germany, meanwhile, was one of the great upsets.\n\nENTERTAINERS\n\nThe goals have been flowing for Spain and Japan, teams that both advanced from the group stage with a game to spare. Both teams secured 5-0 wins against Zambia and both have produced technically excellent displays.\n\nGermany was on a high after its 6-0 rout of Morocco, but was humbled by Colombia.\n\nSweden routed Italy 5-0, while Norway found its scoring touch just in time against the Philippines.\n\nONES TO WATCH\n\nSome of the favorites have made underwhelming starts. The two-time defending champion United States, England, Germany and France have not been totally convincing in group play and the tournament still looks wide open.\n\nColombia looks legitimate, and with Kerr back in action, Australia could become a contender.\n\nThe Netherlands look like serious contenders, while Spain and Japan have impressed. Brazil has shown flashes, but faces a fight to advance from the group stage.\n\nNigeria has shown it is dangerous, and Sweden has picked up back-to-back wins.\n\n___\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\n___\n\nMore AP Women’s World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/08/17/brazils-marta-isnt-finishing-the-olympics-as-shed-hoped/88884132/", "title": "Brazil's Marta isn't finishing the Olympics as she'd hoped", "text": "AP\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Marta crumbled to her knees on the field at Brazil's famed Maracana Stadium, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nThe major international title that has eluded her for her entire career would not come on home soil at these Olympic Games. Brazil was ousted from a shot at the gold-medal match 4-3 on penalties after a scoreless draw against Sweden on Tuesday.\n\nBrazil will still play for the bronze medal against Canada on Friday in Sao Paulo with a chance to salvage the tournament in a smaller way than Marta and her teammates had hoped. Sweden will play Germany for the gold at Maracana.\n\nEven Sweden's players consoled her after the game. Marta has played professionally in that country for the past four years.\n\n\"'They praised our team and said they were sorry for taking Brazil out of the final. They wanted to see us playing in the final here in Brazil. But this is football. Someone has to lose,\" she said. \"They fought until the end, just like we did, and came out on top in the penalties.\"\n\nWhen she finally rose, she and Sweden coach Pia Sundhage shared a warm embrace.\n\n\"All of the Swedish players know Marta very well. I think she had a fantastic game,\" Sundhage said. \"She created a couple of problems for us, but at the end of the day, trying to stop her, I think we did pretty good. Marta is a very good player.\"\n\nKnown simply by her first name, Marta Vieira da Silva won fans all over Brazil during the Olympic tournament.\n\nWhile women's soccer is not very popular in Brazil, Marta impressed with her intelligent play and stellar footwork. When the men's side was struggling early in the tournament, some fans crossed out Neymar's name on their No. 10 jerseys and wrote in \"Marta\" in magic marker.\n\n\"Better than Neymar!\" fans cheered after one match.\n\nMarta grew up playing street soccer with the boys in Dois Riachos, a town about 1,250 miles north of Rio de Janeiro. She was only 17 when she appeared at the 2003 World Cup in the United States.\n\nFor the 2006 season, Marta won the first of an unprecedented five straight FIFA World Player of the Year awards.\n\nDubbed \"Pele in skirts,\" Marta scored seven goals at the 2007 World Cup in China, but Brazil finished as runners-up in the tournament after falling to Germany 2-0 in the final.\n\nWith Marta, the Brazilians won the silver medal at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. Her duel with goalkeeper Hope Solo in the final at the Beijing Games was considered epic. Carli Lloyd scored the game-winner in extra time for the Americans, but it was Solo who fended off a point-blank shot from Marta in the 72nd minute.\n\nOne of their biggest showdowns came at the 2011 World Cup in Germany. Solo came out the victor on penalty kicks after a dramatic 2-2 draw. Marta had both goals for Brazil, including a controversial penalty kick, but Solo was able to stop Daiane in the shootout. The Americans, knocked out in the Rio quarterfinals by Sweden, would go on to the final that year.\n\n\"With Marta you have to have a little extra attention to her, even though our team defense is really good and really organized. That's a compliment to her,\" Solo told The Associated Press during the Olympics. \"I have played for coaches in the past who thought we could just play our style of soccer against Marta, and we've been punished for it. So I'm very aware that we have to pay extra attention to her.\"\n\nMarta has scored 104 goals in 107 international appearances. She has the most World Cup goals with 15. She has 10 Olympic goals, tying her for third on the career list with Abby Wambach of the U.S.\n\nBut what Marta doesn't have in her storied career is a major international title. At 33, it is conceivable that Marta could play in the 2019 Women's World Cup in France.\n\nBrazilian coach Vadao said he hoped Marta and the team's other vets — namely Formiga and Cristiane — don't walk away following the Olympics.\n\n\"I think to lose Formiga, Marta and Cristiane would be regrettable because we need their experience to lead the next generation,\" the coach said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/football/morocco-spain-quarter-finals-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Morocco's World Cup success is no fluke | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter three hours of constant noise, the Education City Stadium was brought to library-like silence as Achraf Hakimi stood over the penalty spot.\n\nHakimi was born in Madrid and the the weight of Africa and the Arab world on his shoulders, but you would never have guessed as the Paris Saint-Germain coolly clipped the ball into the net and set off wild celebrations not just in the stadium, but also in Morocco and for the Moroccan diaspora.\n\nThis was a historic day for Morocco, for Africa, for Arabs and for Muslims. The Atlas Lions had roared to stun 2010 World Cup winner Spain and reach the quarterfinals of Qatar 2022. The significance of the occasion was not lost on head coach Walid Regragui.\n\n“Before it was just the Moroccans who supported us,” he said ahead of the game against Spain. “Now it is the Africans and Arabs.”\n\nFor many, it was the shock of the tournament, as the North Africans won their first ever knockout game at a World Cup.\n\nOn Saturday, Morocco went one better, beating Portugal 1-0 in the quarterfinals to become the first African team to reach a World Cup semifinal.\n\nYoussef En-Nesyri netted the only goal of the match ijust before half time with a spectacular header to score the first ever knockout stage goal in the nation’s history.\n\nBut how did Morocco get to the final four of the most prestigious competition in world football?\n\nReturn of Morocco’s chosen son\n\nMany eyebrows were raised when the Moroccan Federation made the decision to sack Vahid Halilhodžić in August, just over three months ahead of the World Cup after the Bosnian coach had guided the team through qualifying to Qatar 2022.\n\nBut for those in Morocco, it was instead the heir to the Moroccan coaching throne simply taking his place at the perfect time.\n\nAffectionately nicknamed “Rass l’Avocat” (Avocado Head) because of his bald head, Regragui was a hard-tackling defender who, despite being born in France, chose to represent the nation of his family, notching up 45 caps.\n\nRegragui was part of the first group of coaches to earn CAF Pro coaching license which was offered for the first time this year. Youssef Loulidi/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nSince becoming a coach, Regragui has enjoyed success everywhere he has been, leading a mid-table Moroccan club FUS Rabat to their only ever league title.\n\nHe had a brief stint in Qatar where he won the league with Al Duhail SC, before moving back to Morocco where he led Wydad Cassablanca to a league and Champions League double earlier this year.\n\nIt was a matter of when, not if he would take charge of the national team. Many Moroccans thought that it could be after the World Cup or in a few years, but none were unhappy when it was announced he would take over the national side less than 100 days before their first game at the World Cup.\n\nIn African football, Regragui has often been compared with José Mourinho thanks to his tactical discipline and stellar man-management skills. Both of those have been present in the World Cup.\n\nMorocco has played more than 400 minutes of football at the tournament and negotiated a penalty shootout, and yet the Atlas Lions have conceded just once – and that was an unfortunate own goal against Canada in the team’s final Goup F match.\n\nAfter the dramatic shootout win against Spain, video circulated on social media of Regragui running to the stands and hugging and kissing his mother who was in the crowd.\n\nRegragui is a French-born Moroccan. He has assembled the most nationally diverse team at the World Cup – 14 of the 26 players were born outside of Morocco from six different countries – and has seamlessly integrated this group players from around the world into one coherent unit.\n\nWorld Cup tournaments can be tough emotionally to navigate – players are away from home for weeks – but Regragui has counteracted that by allowing the players’ families to stay with the team in camp in Qatar.\n\nAs with that of emotional video of Regragui embracing his mother, one of the most heartwarming photos of the World Cup was Hakimi kissing his mother after Morocco’s victory against Spain.\n\nHakimi scored the winning penalty as Spain missed all three of their penalties. Youssef Loulidi/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nIt’s not only the players who have had their families with them. Regragui himself was filmed going to the stands to visit his mother Fatima who told Morocco broadcaster Arriyadia how much it meant to her.\n\n“During his whole career as a player and as a coach, I never traveled to watch him,” Fatima said. “I’ve been living in France for more than 50 years now and this is the first competition that I left Paris for.”\n\nA Federation taking football seriously\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) should also be credited with the Atlas Lions’ success at Qatar 2022.\n\nAfter decades of footballing mediocrity, the FMRF – with the backing of King Mohammed VI – decided to overhaul the nation’s football structure.\n\nIn 2009 the FMRF opened its national football academy, the Mohamed VI Football Academy – which helped develop current international players like Nayef Aguerd and Youssef En-Nesryi – as well as trying to unearth talent in the Moroccan diaspora by employing scouts from across Europe to flag any eligible youth players in Europe.\n\nThe federation also began investing in women’s football, developing football in schools and clubs as well as a creating a national league structure. Funded by the FMRF, Morocco is currently the only nation in the world to have two tiers of women’s football that are both fully professional.\n\nThe crown jewel of Morocco’s football investment is the Mohamed VI Football Complex just outside Rabat.\n\nThe training complex contains four five-star hotels, eight FIFA standard pitches – one of which is indoor in a climate-controled building – as well a medical facility that includes a dentist.\n\nThat investment over the last decade has begun to pay off.\n\nFor the first time in history, Moroccan clubs are the holders of the men’s and women’s African Champions League titles as well the men’s Confederations Cup – Africa’s Europa League.\n\nMorocco is also the African Nations Championship champion – a continental tournament where nations put out teams exclusively featuring players who play domestically – while the women’s team came second in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year and qualified for its first World Cup.\n\nMorocco’s success at the World Cup may be best story of the tournament so far, but it is not the not the result of luck and grit, but rather expertise and planning.", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}]}

They’re not allowed to touch the gas nozzle. Seriously.\n\nIn New Jersey, it’s been illegal for drivers to pump their own gas since 1949. A ban on self-service gas has been in place in Oregon since 1951, although the state relaxed restrictions for rural towns a few years ago. Violators can be fined up to $500 for breaking these states’ laws.\n\nSo why don’t New Jersey and Oregon let you pump your own gas? And what happened to the days of gas station attendants filling up your tanks in the rest of the country?\n\nIt’s a strange, complex history that dates back more than a century.\n\nSelf-service bans\n\nThe United States has experimented with self-service gas since the first stations were built in the early 1900s. Yet it wasn’t until about 1980 that self-service became the primary gas station model in this country.\n\n“Their rise to the top was not a smooth one,” write Ronald Johnson and Charles Romeo in a 2000 study on the growth of self-service.\n\nThe earliest self-service gas pumps in the United States appeared around 1915. They were designed primarily for emergencies or for after dark when gas stations were closed. People would pre-pay with coins to operate them.\n\nFull-service gas stations adamantly opposed self-service. They saw cheaper, self-service gas as a competitive threat to their business and wanted to limit its spread.\n\nFull-service gas stations with attendants to fill up drivers' tanks were the main form of gasoline retail for decades. FPG/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nFuel sales have slim profit margins. Gas stations made their money and distinguished their brands by offering a variety of services such as oil and battery checks, windshield wiping and vehicle repairs. Station attendants in full uniforms – some wearing bow ties – filled up customers’ tanks, a key part of their larger service strategy to attract drivers in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nFull-service gas stations played up safety hazards around self-service, arguing that untrained drivers would overfill their tanks and start a fire. With support from local fire marshals, gas stations lobbied state legislators to pass bans on self-service. By 1968, self-service was banned in 23 states.\n\nIt was not until the success of self-service internationally and a crucial change in gas stations’ business model that self-service began replacing attendants in the United States.\n\n“Modern self-service gas stations actually were pioneered in Sweden,” said Matt Anderson, the curator of transportation at The Henry Ford museum in Michigan. “Drivers there paid less for self-service than for full-service. From there the concept spread through Europe.”\n\nSelf-service gas stations, like this early one in 1948, became popular as stations lost their hold on the auto service and repair market. AP\n\nAt the same time, vehicle warranties began to stipulate that cars must be serviced at dealerships, a shift that eroded gas stations’ service and repair business.\n\n“Traditional full-service gas stations lost their profit center in automotive repairs and were forced to change their method of operation,” said Wayne Henderson, the author of the book “One Hundred Years of Gas Stations.”\n\nGas stations had to look for new ways to grow profit. They moved to self-service, which reduced their costs and increased volumes on gas sales, and they diversified into selling food, tobacco, coffee, snacks and other items with higher margins.\n\nSelf-service “ended up being more popular because it could create large volumes and opportunities for other profit,” said Gary Scales, a doctoral candidate at Temple University writing a dissertation on the history of gas stations.\n\nGas station operators began pushing states to repeal their self-service bans. By 1992, around 80% of all gas stations nationwide were self-service, up from just 8% two decades prior.\n\n‘Political third rail’\n\nDespite frequent legislative attempts, court challenges and opposition from the gas station industry, New Jersey and much of Oregon still don’t permit self-service.\n\nOregon’s law says it’s in the public interest to maintain the ban. Allowing self-service would increase fire hazards, create challenges for elderly citizens and drivers with disabilities and lead to gas station attendant job losses, according to the statute.\n\nIn 1982, Oregon voters defeated a ballot measure to overturn the ban, but more recent polling shows attitudes in the state are split. A 2014 poll found that Oregon residents were almost evenly divided on the subject, with 44% backing a move to self-service and 46% in favor of keeping the ban.\n\nOregon relaxed its ban in 2018, allowing self-service for drivers in rural counties with populations under 40,000.\n\nIn New Jersey, the self-service ban, along with the state’s reputation for low gas prices, is part of its culture. “Jersey Girls Don’t Pump Gas,” proclaims a popular bumper sticker.\n\nSelf-serve gas is a \"third rail\" of New Jersey politics. Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAttempting to overturn the ban has been seen as a loser politically.\n\n“On self-service gas, that’s been sort of a political third rail in New Jersey,” Gov. Phil Murphy said in April.\n\nBut record gas prices and gas stations’ struggles to find workers have led to renewed attempts by New Jersey gas station industry advocates to lift the ban. In May, 75 gas stations in the state lowered prices in an effort to gain support for allowing self-service gas.\n\nIt’s unlikely that the state will allow drivers to pump their own gas anytime soon, however. The president of the state’s Senate opposes a bill that would end New Jersey’s ban.\n\nThe state’s residents have little interest in self-service. A March poll found that 73% of them say they prefer having their gas pumped for them.\n\n“There is apparently one thing all New Jerseyans can agree on nowadays,” Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, said when the poll was released. “And that’s the time-honored Jersey tradition of having your gas pumped for you.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/03/oregonians-freaking-out-over-law-requires-some-them-pump-their-own-gas/1000215001/", "title": "America is laughing at Oregon for having to pump its own gas", "text": "DETROIT -- Jan. 1 was a monumental day in the state of Oregon, and not just because it rang in a new year.\n\nA brand new state law went into effect that day, and it's a big one. It's a first for the Beaver State. And it's sending shock waves across all 98,000-plus square miles and all 4 million residents as we speak.\n\nFor the first time — in counties with fewer than 40,000 people — Oregonians are allowed to pump their own gas.\n\nReread that last sentence. Take a moment to process it. Oregon didn't pump its own gas. And it still won't in its major counties. The only other state that doesn't allow you to pump your own gas is New Jersey.\n\nWhat's so complicated about pumping gas?!\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAt least several Oregonians are freaking out about the new law.\n\nCase in point: KTVL CBS 10 News in Medford, Ore., posted this Facebook poll on Dec. 29, asking followers if Oregon should allow self-serve gas stations statewide.\n\nHere are some of the, um, more concerned responses, and they're all quite serious:\n\n♦ \"Not a good idea, there are lots of reason to have an attendant helping, one is they need a job too. Many people are not capable of knowing how to pump gas and the hazards of not doing it correctly. Besides I don't want to go to work smelling of gas when I get it on my hands or clothes. I agree Very bad idea.\"\n\n♦ \"I don't even know HOW to pump gas and I am 62, native Oregonian.....I say NO THANKS! I don't want to smell like gasoline!\"\n\n♦ \"I've lived in this state all my life and I REFUSE to pump my own gas. I had to do it once in California while visiting my brother and almost died doing it. This a service only qualified people should perform. I will literally park at the pump and wait until someone pumps my gas. I can't even\"\n\nSo, to recap: Pumping your own gas is too difficult. It's too hazardous. It's too unsafe. And, heaven forbid, you might end up smelling like gasoline afterward. (Somewhere out there, Brian Fantana is smiling at that last one.)\n\nTo be fair, these Oregonians have a point: Pumping gas is a pretty difficult task, right up there with scraping your windshield and turning the heat on. And the fear of smelling like fuel is all too real when there isn't enough time in the day to shower.\n\nLook, Oregon, if you're reading this, we're here to help. Here's a handy guide from roadandtrack.com on how to pump your own gas. It's only 13 steps long.\n\nIn the meantime, while the rest of us point and laugh, maybe don't proclaim you're a better state than the rest of us for a while.

Phil Murphy signed the law, known as the \"Safe Passing Law,\" in August and it went into effect on Tuesday. It was inspired by the death of Metuchen resident Oscar Zanoni, who was fatally struck in 2020 by a tractor-trailer while riding his electric bicycle on Route 27 in Edison near Vineyard Road.\n\nHere's what the law instructs drivers to do when they see a cyclist or pedestrian on the road:\n\nWhen possible, motorists should change to a non-adjacent lane.\n\nIf a lane change is impossible, drivers should leave at least 4 feet of distance while approaching and maintain that distance until the motor vehicle has safely passed.\n\nWhen it is impossible to make a non-adjacent lane change or maintain at least 4 feet of distance, the driver should reduce the speed of the motor vehicle to 25 miles per hour or a lower posted speed and be prepared to stop.\n\nA violator will be fined $100. A driver who commits a violation that results in bodily injury or harm will be fined $500 and assessed two motor vehicle points.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, which Sen. Patrick J. Diegnan Jr. sponsored in the Senate and Assemblymen Robert Karabinchak and Sterley Stanley sponsored in the Assembly, makes New Jersey the 42nd state to enact some form of a safe passing law.\n\nPump your own gas?:NJ ban on self-service fuel may be going away\n\nBetween 2010 and 2019, the number of pedestrian fatalities across the nation increased by 46%, from 4,302 in 2010 to an estimated 6,301 in 2019, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association data.\n\nIn 2010, New Jersey state law changed to require drivers to stop for pedestrians at crosswalks, instead of yielding, as they were required to do before.\n\nA recent NorthJersey.com investigation analyzed hundreds of public records related to pedestrian deaths. Public records requests to the 171 police departments across North Jersey, as part of the investigation, found that 296 people died on highways and streets in Bergen, Passaic, Essex, Morris and Sussex counties between 2010 and 2020.\n\nA combination of high speeds, lack of infrastructure for pedestrians and arterial roadways account for the increase in deaths nationwide and trends on the rise in New Jersey, according to the report.\n\n\"The NJ Safe Passing Law is the strongest safe passing law in the country, and with the increase in road fatalities and serious injuries across the state it comes at a critical time,” Debra Kagan, executive director of the New Jersey Bike & Walk Coalition, said in a statement. \"This law gives us the opportunity to build awareness and prioritize safety first, making our roads safer for everyone, especially vulnerable road users.”\n\nThe future: NJ MVC went from dreaded visit to 'easy' online services after COVID. Here's what's next\n\nDiegnan, who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said in an unrelated interview with The Record last month that pedestrian safety continues to be a priority issue for him.\n\n\"You’ve seen young people, really all ages, riding bicycles on roadways and people are flying past them at 40 miles per hour.

The new program will allow people as young as 18 to drive big interstate semi trucks.\n\nThe new program is coming on-line as the industry complains of driver shortages, which have gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic. Last October, the head of the American Trucking Associations said the industry needed about 80,000 more drivers. Safety advocates, however, are objecting to the program, saying it puts potentially dangerous, inexperienced drivers at the controls of some of the biggest, heaviest vehicles on road.\n\nCurrently, 49 states and the Washington DC give commercial driver licenses to people under 21, Nick Geale, ATA vice president of workforce policy pointed out in a statement. These younger drivers can drive semis throughout large states like California and Texas, he noted, they just can’t cross state lines. This new program will just take some of those drivers and train them so they can cross state lines in their rigs.\n\nChris Spear, CEO of the trucking group, said at the time in October that this program was needed and would help alleviate some of the driver shortage. The ATA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newly enacted regulations.\n\nUnder current federal regulations, only those at least 21 years of age are allowed to drive semi trucks across state lines. The new Safe Driver Apprenticeship Pilot Program will allow people at least 18 years old, and who have a state-issued commercial driver’s license with a clean record, to take the wheel of interstate trucks under the direct supervision of an experienced driver.\n\nThe program was proposed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in September, 2020, but it wasn’t implemented at the time. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law this past November, required the creation of the program, though. The program will soon become operational, according to a notice in the Federal Register.\n\nThe FMCSA will issue a specific exemption to the normal age restrictions for each young driver admitted to the program.

The membership-card requirement was ultimately abandoned.\n\nWhile the state attorney general's office had not commented on Costco's move, a New Jersey Treasury Department spokeswoman told NJ Advance Media it has no restriction on gas sales, as long as motor fuels taxes are paid.\n\nCostco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti confirmed the change to USA TODAY, saying the company now will have a uniform policy nationwide requiring a membership for gas purchases.\n\nAn industry association official said he saw nothing wrong with the policy.\n\n\"I am learning they (Costco) are taking a position that it is not illegal to limit their customers to members at their New Jersey gas stations and I see nothing in state law that prevents them from doing this,\" said Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline, C-Store, Automotive Association headquartered in Wall Township.\n\nLast time around:I learned a painful lesson from inflation in the ’70s that's paying off as things get ugly again\n\nPaying the price:Biden and top aides misread threat of inflation as warning signs gathered\n\nSo I can't buy gas without a Costco card in New Jersey?\n\nRegardless, customers under the impression Costco cannot legally can limit gas to only its club members were confused.\n\n\"I always had to use my Costco card in Ohio, but here in New Jersey they never ask for it,\" said Carnita Brown of the Pemberton area. \"I wonder why it's going to change ... and I have no idea if it's legal to do that here.\"\n\nKelly Borreggine, a former Medford resident now living in Naples, Florida, and who is visiting New Jersey for a week, said she has no problem with Costco restricting gas to club members like her.

Phil Murphy should combat what they call a budding safety and financial crisis at the pumps by suspending a singular, seven-decade old Garden State tradition: the ban on drivers fueling their own vehicles.\n\nIn the past month, attendants across the state's 2,200 stations have quit in droves over fears of contracting the coronavirus from customers, forcing some businesses to close shop, according to an industry trade group. Others have shuttered for a week or more after their employees tested positive – all while sales have reportedly plummeted with fewer cars on the road leading to lower demand.\n\nStory continues below the gallery.\n\nMurphy has remained mum on the issue, remarking in late March that “We have no plans to turn our gas stations into self-service at this time.\" Asked about the issue at his daily coronavirus news conference Friday, the governor said there was \"nothing new to report.\"\n\nThe gas station lobby, however, has proposed a solution, an executive order that relaxes the state law against self-service fueling, at least temporarily.\n\nIronically, the argument for the change is the same as the one that proponents have long used to justify a ban: public safety.\n\n“Providing gasoline stations with this option would allow motorists in New Jersey to refuel their vehicles more safely by eliminating close contact with gasoline station employees,\" reads an April 2 letter sent to the Murphy administration on behalf of 183 stations. That would \"contribute to the slowing of the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the risk to fuel supply lines within the state by the closure of gasoline stations.”\n\nNew Jersey and Oregon remain the only states with laws restricting self-serve gasoline. In late March, Oregon made the practice optional in response to the outbreak, leaving the Garden State as the nation’s lone holdout.\n\nNew Jersey:Murphy's talk on coronavirus testing was consistent — until top aide needed one | Stile\n\nFor subscribers:Bergenfield mom's lawsuit says son's support cat was 'devoured' by dogs while they watched\n\nA change would shift attendants to a more supervisory role, allowing them to sanitize handles and buttons on pumps and to assist the elderly or disabled if needed, according to Sal Risalvato, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline-Convenience-Automotive Association. The group represents hundreds of independently owned gas stations across the state.\n\n“You could pump your own gas and get back in your car after using your own credit card that you don’t have to hand to anybody,” Risalvato said. “I don’t see the sense in not permitting that when you are closing parks.”\n\nHelp can’t come soon enough for Kashmir Gill, the owner of 65 gas stations statewide, who helped author the letter to the governor. At peak employment, he enlisted 350 attendants across his Exxon, Mobile and BP locations, a majority of them immigrants. Within the last month, that number has dwindled to 150, forcing him to cut hours of operation, he said.\n\nThe problem, according to Gill, is that maintaining 6 feet of separation from a customer is “near impossible.”\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak, Wawa convenience stores in Old Bridge, South River and Sayreville have been forced to close temporarily because employees tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"That scared gas station attendants,” Gill said. “Imagine you have to give me change. You're giving me the previous customer’s cash and you’re putting the same money in your pocket, and then giving that to 500 other customers throughout the day.”\n\nThe effects have trickled down to smaller operations like the two-pump Mobile in New Milford, operated by Vikram Kumar. He said his sales dropped 75% almost overnight, with his current clientele comprised of mostly hospital workers, police and other government employees. All of his attendants are outfitted with masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, but he still can’t keep a regular rotation.\n\n“I can’t guarantee their safety, so how can I force them to come to work?” Kumar said. “I’ll be out of business in the next five weeks if things don’t improve.”\n\nA majority of drivers wear masks and gloves, according to Gill, and are sometimes hesitant to roll down their window.\n\n“Customers have come and asked to pump their own gas. And we have to tell them ‘Ma’am, sir, it’s illegal’. They don’t understand that it’s a New Jersey law,” he said.\n\nThe ban has its roots in a Bergen County price war dating back to 1949, when local gas station owners banded together against Paramus entrepreneur Irving Reingold, the last businessman to offer self-serve fuel in New Jersey.\n\nReingold’s prices undercut the competition, and rival station owners reacted by persuading state lawmakers to outlaw self-service, citing public safety as the reason. The state statute reads, in part, “Because of the fire hazards directly associated with dispensing fuel, it is in the public interest that gasoline station operators have the control needed over that activity to ensure compliance with appropriate safety procedures.”\n\nThrough the decades, the prohibition in New Jersey has stuck, even as improvements in credit-card payment systems and pump safety technology helped make self-serve gas available across the country.\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie talked about lifting the self-serve prohibition on the campaign trail in 2009, but later seemed to change his view, citing public opposition and the risk of losing part-time service-station jobs. The industry says it employs more than 5,000 attendants in the state.\n\nThe law has survived despite thawing support among gas station owners. The businesses had long argued that relaxing the ban would allow big oil companies to open high-volume self-serve outlets on the busiest highways, undercutting smaller competitors. But that fear receded as the larger players shed most of their properties, saying the profit margin was too low.\n\nThe gas station trade group estimates that full-service adds at least a 15 cent premium per gallon at the pump.\n\nSome in the state Legislature remain dedicated to bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Gerald Cardinale has introduced half a dozen bills since the 1980s to repeal the self-service law. None has reached a vote, even though advances in pump technology have rendered safety arguments obsolete, said Cardinale, whose district covers northern Bergen and Passaic counties.\n\nThe real obstacle, he said, is the belief that New Jersey residents are above self-serve, a cultural credo epitomized by the popular bumper sticker “Jersey Girls Don’t Pump Gas.”\n\n“We’re the only state left with this idiotic notion that people cannot pump their own gas safely,” Cardinale said. “I’ve always maintained that they have a choice.”\n\nTom Nobile covers Superior Court in Bergen County for NorthJersey.com.

Greg Abbott signed a bill into law Saturday requiring new electric vehicle owners to pay $400 to register their vehicles, in addition to other standard registration fees. Current owners would pay $200 a year when renewing registration. The proposal, Senate Bill 505 was passed by the Texas Senate at the end of March, followed by the House in late April.\n\nThe new fee, which will take effect Sept 1, would not affect hybrid vehicles, who still pay gas taxes, nor would it affect owners of electric motorcycles, mopeds and autocycles, or a neighborhood electric vehicle with a maximum speed of 35 miles per hour.\n\nLawmakers have sought ways to make up for the lack of gasoline tax payments by electric vehicle drivers, but attempts to pass similar measures in the past have been unsuccessful, including measures that would have been a flat fee, or fees based on miles driven.\n\nGas taxes are the primary source of funding for road work in Texas. Currently, drivers of gas-fueled vehicles pay a 20 cent per gallon tax when they fill up at the pump. The gas tax regularly generates more than $3 billion annually, according to state records, including $3.7 billion in fiscal 2018.\n\nMore:With Tesla leading the way, Austin revs up as a key electric vehicle hub\n\nAustin is already an EV hub\n\nThe fee comes as electric vehicle industry experts say alternative fuel vehicles have started to reach a tipping point toward widespread public adoption, and as Central Texas becomes an increasing hub of electric vehicle activity.\n\nCompanies have increasingly set up shop in the Austin area in recent years, including Tesla, which now has its headquarters and a massive manufacturing facility in southeastern Travis County.\n\nAt the same time, electric vehicle ownership has been on the rise. While electric vehicles make up just 2% of overall registered vehicles in the Central Texas region, registration has jumped significantly in the past year, up from nearly 26,700 in May 2022 to nearly 39,000 this May.\n\nThe Austin area is considered particularly bullish on EV adoption, and the region is home to 20% of all registered electric vehicles in Texas.\n\nComparatively, the Dallas-Fort Worth region has 69,996 registered electric vehicles, and Houston has 45,566 registered electric vehicles.\n\nTom \"Smitty\" Smith, executive director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance, an advocacy group for adoption of electric vehicles, said Austin's affinity for electric vehicles is not surprising.\n\n“We're a high-tech titan technology leader,\" Smith said. \"You are likely to have a lot more early adapters and because Tesla's here, people see the enormous Texas Tesla plant and facilities out there. are intrigued and do research and very quickly figure out that this is something they would want to purchase.\"\n\nMore:Tesla moving HQ from California to Austin: 'A huge feather in the cap' for region\n\nMore than two dozen states pay similar fees\n\nTexas is far from the first state to enact a fee for electric vehicles. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles released a 'fair fee' study in December 2020, as part of previous legislative efforts, which showed that at the time nearly 30 other states already have special fees on electric vehicles to make up for a lack of gas tax income. On average, electric vehicle owners in these states paid $119.54.\n\nIn most states the fee only replaces lost state tax, but not federal. Texas's fee is designed to make up for both state and federal gas taxes.\n\nIn Texas, the report said the most straightforward and common approach used by most states that enacted an alternative fuel vehicle fee has been to add a fee to the vehicle registration. The report estimated that the equivalent state gas tax amount would be about $100 a year for electric vehicles, and lower for a hybrid. However, it did note that an increased vehicle registration fee indexed to the cost of inflation would help keep pace with rising costs of building and maintaining Texas transportation infrastructure.\n\nSeveral states including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Michigan Ohio, West Virginia, and Wyoming pay a fee of $200 or more, and several more states, including California, charge $100 or more yearly.\n\nEV advocates say a mileage-based system would be preferred\n\nPrior to the session, electric vehicle groups predicted an electric vehicle specific registration fee would likely pass this year, despite previous failed attempts.\n\nSmith said the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance is neutral on the fee's passage, but he would have preferred to see a mileage-based fee, which he views as a more equivalent system to what gas car drivers are paying.\n\n“We would prefer our members get charged based on miles driven much like other drivers are,” Smith said. “The more you drive in Texas, the more you pay. Those people who drive less pay less than the average for the average driver that's calculated based on what you pay at the gas pump.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/us/california-ban-new-gas-cars-vote/index.html", "title": "California votes to ban new gas car sales by 2035 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCalifornia air regulators voted Thursday to approve stringent rules that would ban the sale of new gasoline cars by 2035 and set interim targets to phase the cars out.\n\nThe measure is a historic one in the US, and would be one of the first such bans worldwide. It has major implications for the US car market, given how large California’s economy is and that several states are expected to implement similar rules.\n\n“This is monumental,” California Air Resources Board member Daniel Sperling told CNN. “This is the most important thing that CARB has done in the last 30 years. It’s important not just for California, but it’s important for the country and the world.”\n\nThe board’s new rules would also set interim quotas for zero-emission vehicles, focusing on new models. Starting with 2026 models, 35% of new cars, SUVs and small pickups sold in California would be required to be zero-emission vehicles. That quota would increase each year and is expected to reach 51% of all new car sales in 2028, 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. The quotas also would allow 20% of zero-emission cars sold to be plug-in hybrids.\n\nThe rules would not impact used vehicles, allowing them to stay on the roads. The rules won’t be immediate, and will go into effect in 2026, Sperling said.\n\nMultiple states are expected to follow suit. Already, 15 states including Colorado and Minnesota, as well as states on the Northeast and West Coast followed California’s previous zero-emission vehicle regulations.\n\nCalifornia doesn’t have an exact count of how many of those states will adopt the 2035 ban on new gas vehicle sales but expects the “majority of the states to follow,” said Alex Stack, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom. New York, Oregon, Washington state and Rhode Island officials confirmed to CNN they plan to adopt California’s rule through their own rule-making process, while New Jersey and Maryland officials said they were reviewing California’s decision. Public comment in Washington state on a similar plan will start September 7.\n\n“This is a critical milestone in our climate fight, which is why Washington is poised to institute these same requirements by the end of the year,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told CNN in a statement. “We look forward to partnering with other states and the Biden Administration to rapidly reduce the country’s primary source of greenhouse gas emissions.”\n\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos told CNN in a statement that California’s Thursday vote “unlocks New York’s ability to adopt the same regulation.”\n\nSperling said that if most of these states follow California’s lead, it could transform the US auto industry.\n\n“This is a big part of the US market,” Sperling said. “Even if the feds don’t move on a regulatory perspective, a big chunk of the country will be moving forward.”\n\nSperling added the process of drafting the rules had received “surprisingly little debate” and pushback from car companies, a signal that companies themselves are embracing the move to zero-emission vehicles. Several companies including Ford and GM have already announced ambitious plans to move toward zero-emission cars, trucks and SUVs.\n\n“The car companies see what’s happening in China, in Europe,” Sperling said. “Many of them have already made announcements about how they’re converting totally to electric vehicles.”\n\nThursday’s vote is the culmination of years of work; in 2020, Newsom signed an executive order mandating that all vehicles sold in the state must be zero-emission by 2035.\n\n“What these new standards do is set the roadmap to get there,” California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Thursday.\n\nCalifornia also got a boost from the Biden administration, which reinstated California’s longtime ability to set its own vehicle emission standards earlier this year.

After Oregon changed its law against self-serve gas at the beginning of this year, New Jersey is the last state to bar the practice.\n\nBut in the late 1960s, it was a hard sell. In Wisconsin, approval for the self-operated pumps — you fed the pump with coins or $5 bills, at a time when you could get three gallons of gas for $1 — came over the objections of gas dealers.\n\n\"How about the guy with a cigarette in his mouth and his car blows up?\" Robert Felker, managing director of the Wisconsin Petroleum Association, asked at a Feb. 16, 1967, hearing, according to a story the next day in the Milwaukee Sentinel.\n\nEven after the new rules were enacted, the dealers fought, convincing a legislative committee that more talk was needed, and to put the rule on hold.\n\n\"As more and more people are exposed to it, there is going to be more and more danger,\" Harold Johnson, assistant to the president of Clark Oil Co., said in a Feb. 24, 1968, Sentinel story about a hearing held Feb. 23.\n\nCharles Miller, chairman of the committee recommending the rules for the self-service pumps, countered that the gas dealers \"were underestimating the driving public.\"\n\nOn May 8, 1968, over the gas dealers' objections, DIHLR gave its final approval on self-service gas pumps.\n\nStill, it took awhile for DIY gas to take hold in Wisconsin. In August 1971, The Milwaukee Journal's Mildred Freese checked around the city and found only a half-dozen self-service stations. A couple of energy crises later, The Milwaukee Journal's Larry Sussman reported on Nov. 5, 1984, 81% of the gas sold in Wisconsin was self-serve.\n\nSelf-service gas wasn't the only car-related trend to become law but not fact in 1968.\n\nOn Jan. 1 of that year, federal law mandated that all vehicles (except buses) with seats had to be fitted with seat belts. To see what drivers might be up against, the Sentinel sent reporter Keith Spore — later the editor of the Sentinel and publisher of the Journal Sentinel — to try one on for size.\n\nIt wasn't a good fit.\n\n\"After fumbling with several buckles, the reporter feared he would never find the right combination,\" Spore wrote in a story published Jan. 4, 1968.\n\nSpore also talked to salesmen at three local car dealerships, who agreed that customers generally didn't like the seat belts.\n\n\"One salesman said, 'To them (car buyers), it's just something extra hanging on the wall. They don't realize that the harnesses can save your neck.\"\n\nIt was a message that took awhile to sink in. Wisconsin didn't require seat-belt use until December 1987.\n\nOur Back Pages: 1968\n\nAbout this feature\n\nOn Wednesdays this year, the Green Sheet's Our Back Pages will look back at 1968 in Milwaukee, sharing stories of the events that shaped and reflected a changing city as reported and photographed by the Journal Sentinel's predecessor newspapers, The Milwaukee Journal and Milwaukee Sentinel.\n\nSpecial thanks and kudos go to senior multimedia designer Bill Schulz for finding many of the gems in the Journal Sentinel photo archives.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/27"}]}

We're using mobile apps for everything from cashing checks to transferring money to someone else to splitting a check at dinner or paying a bill.\n\nAmid stay-at-home orders nationwide, many bank branches didn't allow walk-up traffic and were available to customers only by appointment. So mobile banking is a welcome alternative and may continue to be one for some time.\n\nMobile banking is attracting many novice customers now, too, and they might not be familiar with some scams.\n\n\"Studies of U.S. financial data indicate a 50% surge in mobile banking since the beginning of 2020,\" according to an FBI alert about cybercrime.\n\nYet the FBI is warning that we've got to watch out for:\n\nFake banking apps\n\nBad actors are designing apps that impersonate the real apps of real banks. The goal is to trick you into entering your login credentials.\n\n\"These apps provide an error message after the attempted login,\" the FBI warned.\n\nThe fake app later will use smartphone permission requests to obtain and bypass security codes texted to users.\n\n\"U.S. security research organizations report that in 2018, nearly 65,000 fake apps were detected on major app stores, making this one of the fastest growing sectors of smartphone-based fraud,\" the FBI said.\n\nPhishing attacks\n\nNot surprisingly, hackers are out to steal your banking credentials through sophisticated phishing attacks as more people work from home amid the pandemic.\n\nAnd frankly, there may be more money to steal as Economic Impact Payments began steadily arriving in bank accounts since April. Even jobless benefits can become a target because they have provided a flow of cash when state benefits are combined with a $600 extra weekly payment from the federal government.\n\n\"We're seeing fraudsters trying to take advantage of the fear and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic,\" said Paul Benda, senior vice president of risk and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association.\n\nBenda would expect phishing attempts designed to harvest bank account information to heat up further if Congress approves a second round of stimulus checks.\n\n\"Any time there's a lot of money flowing from one place to another, the fraudsters try to intercept it,\" he said.\n\nIn general, con artists might attempt to send you an email claiming that a bank rejected depositing your stimulus payment, and the email could suggest you need to click on a link to fix the problem.\n\nIf you click on the link, of course, you're possibly downloading malware or being directed to a malicious website.\n\nIf you go to one of these fake sites and input your account number and password, the criminal has it now and can log in on the legitimate site.\n\nPhishing campaigns in the past have even spoofed the login pages of some Canadian banks. Phony sites could trick customers into entering a username and password to help a criminal access a bank account and steal money from it.\n\nBanks and others are trying to detect fraud early on, as well.\n\nIn 2018, banks stopped $22.3 billion in fraud attempts, according to the American Bankers Association’s 2019 Deposit Account Fraud Survey report. The industry group said banks’ prevention measures stopped nearly $9 out of every $10 of attempted fraud.\n\nEven so, it's up to the consumer to be skeptical and try to spot any trouble, too. Sometimes, you need to pay extra attention to your bank statements, especially when fraudulent activity is seeing an increase.\n\nConsumers need to use a two-factor authentication when they access banking via an app to secure accounts against compromise, the FBI said.\n\nWhat you don't want to do is act in haste if you get an email that seems to be alerting you to trouble. The con artists will always engineer a way to make you act quickly before you might suspect fraud.\n\nSo a phishing email might suggest that it's urgent that you act now if you want to avoid being locked out of your bank account. Again, don't click on any links or call any phone numbers listed in that email. Call your bank directly to see if there is a problem.\n\nAnd review your bank statements regularly.\n\nBank of America, for example, has sent notices in the past month to some of its customers that stressed that it's the customer's responsibility to examine their statements \"carefully and promptly.\" Customers need to raise questions when necessary about any errors with electronic transactions or withdrawals.\n\n\"You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account.\"\n\nAccording to federal regulations, customers must notify banks in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within specific timeframes in order to be fully protected against losses. You'd need to check your deposit agreement for a specific time to report problems.\n\nWhen it comes to errors involving your debit card or other electronic transactions such as a direct deposit, under the law you must dispute an error within 60 days of the first bank statement that shows the error.\n\n\"You may raise the dispute either in writing or orally, but the bank can ask that you send a written confirmation of the dispute within 10 days of an oral dispute. It may be a good idea to submit a dispute in writing so that you have a record of it,\" according to the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nScams, no doubt, will keep spreading in light of all the stress that consumers face in the COVID-19 era.

Just ask Linda Murray Bullard, who recently found herself in that situation.\n\n“A horrific experience!” says Murray Bullard, who owns a business consulting firm in Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\nHow common her experience is isn’t clear. The ATM Industry Association doesn’t have data that would show the scope of this issue, according to Michael Lee, the group’s chief executive, who says he hasn’t “heard of a single reported case of this happening.” The American Bankers Association didn’t respond to requests for comment when asked about such incidents.\n\nHowever, Murray Bullard certainly isn’t alone: Based on scores of online message board discussions on the topic, cash-hungry ATMs aren’t a completely unheard-of phenomenon. And considering that 68% of Americans use ATMs at least once a month, according to a 2014 Nielsen study, it’s worth knowing how to respond to this potentially frustrating situation.\n\nStand your ground and contact your bank\n\nAlthough it may not come naturally to some people, the name of the game is keeping your cool. For Murray Bullard, that meant staying put and immediately reaching out to her bank.\n\n“When it chewed up my money, I refused to move before I contacted the bank and spoke to a live person,” she says.\n\n“The lady assured me it would be corrected the next business day and someone would call me as soon as it was corrected. They did just what she said, and my deposit was credited.”\n\n»Star Wars-themed ATMs? Check out some of the world’s most unusual money machines.\n\nConfirm that your bank performs an investigation\n\nShane Allen, media relations director of Personal Trainer Food, a Fort Worth, Texas-based company that helps consumers create healthy meal plans, found himself in a similar predicament a few months ago when he tried to deposit $800 at a Capital One cash machine.\n\n“The ATM took the cash and printed out a receipt saying there’d been an error, and that I should call a certain phone number,” Allen says.\n\nHis bank assured him that it would look into the situation when he called and credited his account for the time being.\n\n“They warned me that they would investigate all the deposits that day and, if for some reason they determine the deposit was less, they’d take it out of my account,” Allen says.\n\nA month later, Allen received a letter in the mail saying that the bank had completed its investigation and determined that he did, in fact, deposit $800.\n\n“Overall, I think they handled it very well,” he says. Capital One didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment.\n\nIf an ATM eats your deposit, you should contact your bank immediately, says Kristopher Dahl, a spokesman for Wells Fargo. That will spur an examination of the incident.\n\n“I can’t share much information about the investigation process, but all transactions are logged, and we utilize our logs to research these transactions,” Dahl says, adding that those instances happen rarely. “If a problem with an ATM results in any account fees, we will also credit their account for those fees.”\n\nNote the time of the transaction, gather evidence\n\nAs well as eating cash, ATMs also swallow checks on occasion, as Natalie Nicole Gilbert can attest to.\n\n“If you must use an ATM and it goes awry, note the time of the failed deposit,” says Gilbert, a Los Angeles-based musician who recently tried depositing a check worth about $1,000.\n\nBecause she didn’t usually use that particular account to make deposits of that size, the transaction “tripped a security feature that suspected potential fraud,” Gilbert says. As a result, her financial institution froze her funds while trying to verify that the check was valid.\n\n“It was particularly inconvenient, as I’d intended to pay my rent that month with that check, and the hold didn’t release for another week or more after my rent was due,” she says.\n\nGilbert recommends that customers take smartphone pictures of the error screen on the ATM if one comes up during a botched transaction. She adds that people may want to copy the serial numbers on bills before inserting currency into a machine. The more evidence you can gather, the better.\n\nResponding quickly is crucial\n\nAlthough faulty ATMs can make you feel extremely powerless, the ball is very much in your court to fix the situation. Your first move should be to alert your bank or credit union, which will investigate before crediting your account.\n\nTony Armstrong is a staff writer covering personal finance forNerdWallet.

Taxpayers may exclude unemployment compensation up to $20,400 if married filing jointly when two people lost work. (The legislation excludes only some 2020 unemployment benefits from taxes.)\n\nIt's not a small change. Once that extra income is excluded, many people are owed big money. And some are happy to see it now.\n\nOne Detroit area taxpayer told me he spotted an extra $2,251.76 in his Comerica account on Thursday morning. The single man had collected unemployment compensation last year after auto factories shut down during the pandemic. But he filed his tax return on March 9 — two days before the American Rescue Plan was signed into law.\n\nHe was expecting $2,244 in an extra tax refund, thanks to the new exclusion. But on Thursday, he received an extra $7.76 — money he assumed could be added interest.\n\nNot everyone who is owed cash is receiving this money now.\n\nYou're not getting cash if you owe money to the federal government and others.\n\n\"These refunds are subject to normal offset rules, such as past-due federal tax, state income tax, state unemployment compensation debts, child support, spousal support or certain federal nontax debts (i.e., student loans),\" the IRS said.\n\n\"The IRS will send a separate notice to the taxpayer if the refund is offset to pay unpaid debts.\"\n\nAlso it's important to note that many people who are married — and have more complex income tax returns — won't receive the extra refund until later this summer.\n\nThe IRS had not given any official updates to the process as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nBut the IRS did post on Twitter on Wednesday: \"#IRS is now issuing refunds for taxes on 2020 unemployment compensation that were paid before they were excluded from taxable income by recent law changes.\"\n\nThe IRS gave some more details of the expected rollout for the money on May 14.\n\nThe IRS first stated on March 31 that it would recalculate taxes to \"automatically refund money this spring and summer to people who filed their tax return reporting unemployment compensation before the recent changes made by the American Rescue Plan.\"\n\nThat March 31 press release indicated that those refunds would start in May.\n\nMore:Extra tax refund money for unemployed isn't arriving soon enough for some\n\nMore:How some in Michigan who lost jobs in 2020 are getting extra cash now\n\nI heard last month from upset taxpayers who had not yet received their money by mid-May and I wrote about their anger.\n\nTaxpayers who didn't see their money for most of May also took to social media, including Twitter, to express extreme frustration about waiting more than two months to get their money.\n\n\"Same tweet day after day but yet nothing in my bank account,\" one person stated Wednesday.\n\n\"Nothing in my bank yet,\" tweeted another Wednesday.\n\nOne Twitter account — @unemploymenttax — voiced the frustration of many. But on Thursday, consumers began reporting that they had started seeing some direct deposits.\n\nSome of the direct deposits — which most likely would involve single taxpayers with simple returns — went out earlier to some online outfits, such as Chime Bank, based on crowdsourcing by @unemploymenttax.\n\nSome people who still haven't found jobs could use the extra $2,000 or so to pay bills or move to a town with better job prospects.\n\nUnder the tax rule change, taxpayers are able to exclude up to $10,200 of unemployment benefits received in 2020 for a single person from taxable income — or as much as $20,400 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nAnd the exclusion only applies to households earning up to $150,000. If your modified AGI is $150,000 or more, you can’t exclude any unemployment compensation.\n\nThe income cap is the same for singles and married couples filing joint returns.\n\nMillions of people claimed this break when they filed their federal income tax returns later in March or afterward once tax software or tax professionals would have been able to calculate your taxes based on the new rules relating to jobless compensation.\n\nThe IRS began accepting 2020 tax returns Feb. 12 — a month before the change — and has estimated that more than 10 million taxpayers in this group filed returns before the law was changed.\n\nOn May 14, the IRS said it would first begin issuing that extra refund money to single taxpayers who do not have complex returns, such as single taxpayers who did not claim children or any refundable tax credits.\n\nThe IRS said: \"The IRS will issue refunds resulting from this effort by direct deposit for taxpayers who provided bank account information on their 2020 tax return.\"\n\nBut the refund will be mailed as a paper check to the address of record if the IRS does not have direct deposit information.\n\nThe IRS has asked taxpayers not to file amended returns to get this extra refund. An amended return would be needed, though, if the taxpayer suddenly would qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit or other key credits, based on a lower overall income.\n\nIn Michigan, taxpayers need to file an amended state return if they are owed an extra refund of around $400 or so in state income taxes if they filed a return before the new tax break went into law.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/economy/china-bank-runs-protests-intl-mic-hnk/index.html", "title": "Small banks in China are running into trouble. Savers could lose ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nPeter had put his life savings of about $6 million into accounts at three small banks in China’s central Henan province. He says he hasn’t been able to access them since April.\n\nThe 45-year-old entrepreneur asked us to call him Peter for security reasons. He’s from the eastern city of Wenzhou and is just one of thousands of depositors who have been fighting to recover their savings from at least six banks in rural provinces in central China.\n\n“I’m close to having a nervous breakdown. I can’t sleep,” Peter told CNN Business.\n\nWhen he tried to access his accounts online, a statement would pop up on the homepage informing him that the website was under maintenance and services would be unavailable for a while, Peter told CNN Business. Two months later, those services have not been restored.\n\nThe trouble began in April, when four banks in Henan suspended cash withdrawals.\n\nIn China, local banks are only permitted to obtain deposits from their home customer base, but authorities say that “third-party platforms” were used to acquire funds from depositors outside the region. In Peter’s case, for example, his hometown is over 700 miles away from the banks in Henan.\n\nThe national banking regulator has accused a major shareholder of the four banks of illegally attracting money from savers. “Henan New Fortune Group, a shareholder of the four village banks, has illegally absorbed the public’s funds through internal and external collusion, the use of third-party platforms, and fund brokers,” the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission told state-run Xinhua News Agency in May.\n\nDepositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen. From Lan Nuo Nuo in February\n\n“The police have opened a case for investigation into the matter,” it added.\n\nRuns on small Chinese banks have become more frequent in recent years and some have been accused of financial improprieties or corruption. But experts worry that a much bigger financial problem could be looming, caused by fallout from a real estate crash and soaring bad debts related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThere are no official estimates yet on the total amount of funds that bank depositors are unable to withdraw. CNN Business did not receive a comment from the local police or the national banking regulator.\n\nAs many as 400,000 banking customers across China were unable to access their savings, according to an estimate in April by Sanlian Lifeweek, a state-owned magazine.\n\nThat’s a drop in the ocean of China’s vast banking system, but about a quarter of the industry’s total assets are held by around 4,000 small lenders, which often have opaque ownership and governance structures and are more vulnerable to corruption, say experts, and the sharp economic slowdown.\n\n“The scope of the bank scandals where bank officials embezzle and steal funds from depositors is alarming, and what is exposed could only be the tip of the iceberg,” said Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.\n\n“As the Chinese economy slows down further, the fiscal shortage worsens, and the debt repayments become more widespread among Chinese companies, especially in the real estate sector, bank runs could become more often and on a larger scale,” he said.\n\nMany savers have had enough. Late last month, hundreds of depositors traveled to Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, to protest outside the office of the banking regulator and to demand their money back, to no avail.\n\nAnother protest was planned in June. But as the depositors arrived in Zhengzhou, they were stunned to find that their health codes — which were green upon departure — had turned red, according to six people who spoke with CNN and social media posts. Anyone with a red code — usually assigned to people infected with Covid or deemed by authorities to be at high risk of infection — immediately becomes persona non grata.\n\nThey are banned from all public venues and transport and are often subject to weeks of government quarantine.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Zhengzhou government for comment. The Henan Provincial Health Commission told state-run news website thepaper.cn it was “investigating and verifying” the complaints from depositors who received red codes.\n\nWhat’s behind the problem in Henan\n\nIn Henan, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has put the blame on the private investment firm that holds large stakes in all four lenders.\n\nLast week, the Henan police said that a criminal gang headed by the investment firm’s controller “has been suspected of using village banks to commit serious crimes.” Police say several suspects have been arrested.\n\nThe Henan New Fortune Group no longer has a website. CNN tried to reach the company for comment on the phone and by email without success. The company has made no public statements and it’s believed to have been annulled.\n\nLater on Monday, the four Henan banks said they would start collecting information from customers who have been affected by the shutdown of their online transaction systems. The move was required by financial regulators, the banks added in separate statements on their website, without elaborating further.\n\nThat’s of little comfort to the banks’ customers. Deposits up to 500,000 yuan (almost $75,000) are guaranteed in the event of bank failures, but that’s not enough for some — like Peter — and if the government’s investigation finds that their savings are “non-compliant” transactions, they could lose everything.\n\n“I’m quite worried about how they [authorities] are going to deal with our money,” said Ye, who asked CNN Business to only use his surname. Ye is a 30-year old tech worker from the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province — about 1500 km (900 miles) from the banks he used in Henan. He said he has a total of 160,000 yuan (about $24,000) worth of deposits with them.\n\n“We were told by the banks that the deposit products were legal, and that they were protected by the deposit insurance scheme,” he said. “We just want to get our money back.”\n\nThe four banks — Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng — have not replied to requests for comment.\n\nRisky liabilities\n\nIn early 2021, Beijing banned banks from selling deposit products via third party online platforms, fearing that the rapid expansion of the fintech sector could increase risks in the wider financial system. The People’s Bank of China called such practices “illegal financial activities.”\n\nSo why were small local banks in Henan apparently ignoring the ban and raising deposits from savers — like Ye, who live on the other side of the country?\n\nChina’s national banking and insurance regulator says third party online platforms allowed them to bypass these geographical restrictions and grow their business nationwide.\n\nIn the Henan case, various state-run media are reporting that the deposit products were sold via platforms affiliated with, or owned by, giants of China’s tech scene such as Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com. (JD)\n\nThose platforms — Du Xiaoman Financial, which is the financial affiliate of Baidu, as well as JD Finance — have not responded to requests for comment.\n\n“The central government regulators seem to be incapable of enforcing those regulations aimed at preventing this kind of bank run from occurring,” said Frank Xie, the Chinese economy expert. He added that corruption was “rampant” at local levels of financial institutions.\n\n“Perpetrators such as the person stealing millions from the depositors often get shielded by accomplices in governments and in the upper-level management of the banks,” Xie said.\n\n“The core problem is that China’s financial system simply expanded far too fast relative to the size of the economy over the previous decade,” said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group.\n\nChina’s banking sector has increased sixfold in size since 2008, with total assets reaching over $50 trillion, according to government statistics.\n\nThe funding structure of small lenders also makes them more risky, say experts.\n\nCompared with big banks, they are more reliant on deposits for funding. Many of them offer high interest rates to attract commercial and interbank deposits. But as the slowing economy means borrowers struggle to repay the banks, it becomes difficult for them to deliver the returns they offered savers.\n\n“The funding structure of liabilities in many of China’s mostly smaller and regional banks is most likely still vulnerable to deposit runs, lender caution, and deteriorating economic performance and rising unemployment,” said George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University and former chief economist at UBS.\n\nDeteriorating financial health\n\nThe Henan crisis arrived at a time when public confidence in China’s banking system was already waning.\n\nIn the past decade, Beijing has been clamping down on “shadow banking” activities — which means unregulated, off-the-book lending by financial institutions — on worries that most of the funds had been diverted to property developers and local government infrastructure projects, leading to a rapid run-up in debt and growing financial risks.\n\nIn 2019, China seized control of Baoshang Bank, based in Inner Mongolia, citing serious credit risks posed by the lender.\n\nIt was the first bank seizure in China in more than 20 years and the lender was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe following year, there were at least five bank runs at small lenders, mostly triggered by public fears following reports of financial distress at the banks or anti-graft investigations into bank executives.\n\n“Financial institutions are still grappling with some of the losses that have resulted, particularly in China’s northeast, central provinces, and western regions, where shadow banking activities had expanded the fastest over the past decade,” Wright said.\n\nMaking matters worse, “the ongoing slowdowns in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic have further exposed financial institutions to new credit risks as well,” Wright added.\n\nSpillover effects\n\nInvestors are closely watching the government’s investigation into the Henan bank run. Analysts are gauging possible spillover effects to other banks.\n\n“The economy is a key reason why affected banks might be experiencing difficulties, and it is quite possible that other banks will be affected, perhaps even larger banks, given that the fate of the property market and real estate prices hang in the balance,” said Magnus from Oxford University.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling with the country’s zero-Covid policy. Many cities have been placed under full or partial lockdowns since March, wreaking havoc on activity. Analysts are worried that the economy could contract in the second quarter.\n\n“This could have multiplier effects given that real estate as an asset class could be compromised now for a few years,” Magnus said.\n\nChina’s gigantic real estate sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, is in a worsening downturn. Sales by the country’s top 100 developers collapsed 59% in May from a year ago, according to a recent survey by property research firm Cric China.\n\nEvergrande — one of the country’s biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande’s collapse could have ripple effects across the property industry and spill over to the financial system.\n\nProperty loans accounts for nearly 30% of outstanding loans with China’s financial institutions.\n\nAnalysts aren’t yet worrying about a financial crisis — because the PBOC is likely to ensure that larger and systemically more important banks are protected.\n\nBut the discontent triggered by the bank runs could be a major concern for the government.\n\nWhen Covid health codes of depositors turned red early last week, derailing a planned protest in Zhengzhou, it sparked a massive outcry on social media.\n\n“Now (the authorities) can stop you from petitioning by directly putting digital shackles on you, aka giving you red codes,” said one comment on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform.\n\nDozens of depositors were taken into a quarantine hotel guarded by police and local officials, before being sent away on trains bound for their hometowns the next day; others were “quarantined” at several other locations in the city, including a college campus, according to the witnesses and online posts.\n\n“Many people lost their lifetime savings because of this and [if] more incidences like this takes place, and [if] a bank run is met with a government crackdown, social unrest will be the only end result,” Xie said.\n\n— Nectar Gan, CNN’s Beijing bureau, and Wayne Chang contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2021/01/08/stimulus-check-2021-recovery-rebate-tax-return/6579722002/", "title": "What to do if you must file a tax return for missing stimulus check", "text": "Still crossing your fingers that a second stimulus payment will show up soon?\n\nUnfortunately for those who haven't received money yet, the latest relief rollout will not stretch out like we saw last year when some people received stimulus money in April and others saw it in May or June.\n\nWe've got a very short window in January to spot much of that stimulus money now.\n\nAs a result, a second stimulus check might never arrive for some struggling families. Eventually, they will see relief but it won't be the kind of help many expect. And they'll have to file a 2020 tax return to see the money.\n\nFor some people, it won't be extra cash that arrives out of the blue and can be easily spent tomorrow.\n\nThis time around, the Internal Revenue Service, by law, must issue the latest Economic Impact Payments by Jan. 15. The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 set the cutoff date for sending the latest payments.\n\nThe latest stimulus has a short window to arrive via direct deposit, paper check or a government-related debit card.\n\nPayments started going out the last week of December and will continue through early January, according to Luis Garcia, an IRS spokesperson.\n\nThe IRS said Friday that more than 100 million stimulus payments have been direct deposited into bank accounts.\n\n\"For those who have not yet received direct deposits,\" the IRS said Friday, \"they should continue to watch their bank accounts for a deposit in coming days.\"\n\nThe IRS and Treasury are working with tax preparation firms to correct a problem involving some payments sent to wrong bank accounts, and many people could end up seeing direct deposits as a result of those efforts.\n\nOn Thursday, the Treasury Department and the IRS announced that it began sending about 8 million prepaid debit cards, called the Economic Impact Payment card, to some people. The card is sponsored by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and is issued by Treasury’s financial agent, MetaBank. The IRS said the agency does not determine who receives a prepaid debit card.\n\nInformation about these cards is available at EIPcard.com.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel reminded residents and operators of nursing homes and other care facilities that Economic Impact Payments belong to the person named on the check, not to the organization providing care.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission reported that some nursing homes and assisted living communities were taking the first round of payments from their residents last year, particularly those on Medicaid. \"The residents were reportedly coerced into signing over their checks to the facility in which they were housed,\" according to the AG's Office.\n\nSome money will continue in the next week or so to head to people who need it after the COVID-19-induced recession.\n\nBut if you don't get a debit card or a check or a direct deposit sometime soon, well, you're on your own of sorts.\n\nWhat is the Recovery Rebate Credit?\n\nTaxpayers will need to file a 2020 federal income tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit if they didn't get the money or they received less money than they're eligible to get, such as if a child's stimulus wasn't included in the payout.\n\nThe Recovery Rebate Credit will reduce how much they owe on their 2020 income tax return or boost their tax refund sometime in March or April or later.\n\nThe Recovery Rebate Credit is listed on Line 30 of the 1040 Form for the 2020 tax year.\n\nMark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, said taxpayers will be able to calculate the credit owed based on their 2020 income and family situation.\n\nThe second payments are up to $600 for individuals who qualify and up to $1,200 for a married couple filing a joint return with no children. An extra $600 is added to the latest payout, for example, for each qualifying child ages 16 and younger.\n\nIf you received less money — or didn't get that check or direct deposit — before you file a tax return, you'd need to turn to Line 30 on the 1040 to fix the trouble spots and help you claim what you are owed.\n\nMore:Taxpayers report IRS stimulus payments being sent to wrong bank accounts\n\nMore:IRS says: Check back later on stimulus payments\n\nMore:Lost a job?

He noted that the most recent legislation, which was signed by President Donald Trump on Dec. 27, specifically states that those who died in 2019 or earlier are not covered and their payments must be returned to the federal government.\n\nIs the stimulus money taxable?\n\nSome people are concerned that they'll pay income taxes on the stimulus payouts, but they won't. The first and second round of stimulus cash will not be treated as taxable income. (Unemployment compensation is taxable.)\n\nAnother plus: Those taxpayers who received the correct amount of stimulus last year for the first round and this year for the second do not have to deal with completing the recovery credit on the 2020 tax return.\n\nWhen it comes to getting paperwork ready, you'll want to dig up the IRS Notice 1444 for the stimulus payment amount you were issued in 2020. And the second round of payments would be outlined in Notice 1444-B.\n\nThe Recovery Rebate Credit would be reduced by any Economic Impact Payment that you've already received. You'd use a recovery credit worksheet to figure out the credit amount.\n\nFirst figure out if you're eligible. You cannot tap into the Recovery Rebate Credit if you are claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return, for example.\n\nIncome limits do apply to the credit. Eligibility for the payments starts to phase out at adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe stimulus payment is cut by $5 for every $100 of income earned above the thresholds. For example, a couple earning more than $174,000 won't get a second stimulus payment — that compares with the $198,000 cutoff with the first higher payments that started out at $2,400 for married couples with no children.\n\nSingle people making more than $87,000 wouldn't get stimulus money now.\n\nAn important point to note: You'd want to file a 2020 federal income tax return even if you are not required to file a return in order to get that recovery rebate. The same is true, of course, if you qualify for things like the Earned Income Tax Credit for lower income workers or some other credits.\n\n\"If you received a partial payment, you may be able to claim more in the form of a recovery rebate credit when you file your 2020 taxes,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and tax expert for TurboTax.\n\n\"If you received too much,\" she said, \"the IRS says that you don’t have to pay it back.\"\n\nIt is still possible to check whether the IRS is sending the second stimulus to you now. See \"Get My Payment\" at IRS.gov.\n\nMany consumers who have gone to that site, though, have found some IRS messages to be unclear. Many wonder what it means if the IRS tool says: “Payment Status #2 – Not Available.\" Does that mean you don't qualify?\n\nThe IRS said the statement means that you will not receive a second Economic Impact Payment via direct deposit or the mail. You're going to have to use that Recovery Rebate Credit.\n\nAnd, yes, that means you must wait even longer for the so-called relief money. It's not exactly comforting news, especially for many taxpayers who told me repeatedly the past week that they received their first stimulus payment without a hitch. They don't know what's wrong now.\n\nThe IRS maintains: \"The IRS is working hard to deliver the second Economic Impact Payment quickly, as required by law, while still preparing for the upcoming 2021 tax filing season. Due to the compressed timeline, the IRS is unable to reissue and mail checks and instead encourages people to file their 2020 tax return electronically to claim and receive the Recovery Rebate Credit quickly as possible.\"\n\nAre some people seeing that money after glitches?\n\nThe IRS noted on Friday that some recipients who used refund anticipation loans or similar products may have had their payment directed to the temporary bank account established when their 2019 tax return was filed.\n\n\"The IRS and tax industry partners are taking immediate steps to redirect stimulus payments to the correct account for those affected. The IRS anticipates many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort.\"\n\nThe effort to fix this problem was ongoing Friday, so there continues to be much confusion for many taxpayers. And you might not always see the correct answer by using the \"Get My Payment\" tool at IRS.gov.\n\n\"For those taxpayers who checked Get My Payment and received a response indicating a direct deposit was to be sent to an account they do not recognize, the IRS advises them to continue to monitor their bank accounts for deposits,\" the IRS said Friday.\n\n\"The IRS emphasizes that the information taxpayers see in the Get My Payment tool, including account numbers and potential deposit dates, may not display an accurate account number as we continue to work through updates.\"\n\nOn the plus side, several taxpayers who had issues in early January told me later this week that they did end up receiving a direct deposit of their second stimulus payment after all.\n\nThese consumers had their taxes prepared through H&R Block and choose to have their tax preparation fees deducted from their income tax refunds. But part of that process led to some delays in the stimulus rollout.\n\nTax preparation firms set up temporary bank accounts so that the refunds can be sent to those accounts, the fees can be deducted and then the client receives the remaining refund cash.\n\nThose accounts are often closed or inactive after tax season so when the IRS sent money to those accounts, the money had to be sent back to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nJackson Hewitt's industry sources, for example, estimate that the IRS inadvertently sent out stimulus payments to more than 13 million bank accounts that are no long open or valid.\n\nMillions of stimulus payments faced slowdowns because of these types of inactive accounts.\n\nH&R Block said it would be working to get the second round of stimulus money to customers through direct deposit to their bank accounts or prepaid debit cards.\n\nTurboTax posted online: \"Unfortunately, because of an IRS error, millions of payments were sent to the wrong accounts and some may not have received their stimulus payment.\n\nOn Friday, a TurboTax spokesperson indicated that progress was being made and stimulus payments for millions of its customers affected by the issue started hitting bank accounts on Friday.\n\n“We have been working tirelessly with the Treasury and IRS to get stimulus payments to our customers. We know how important these funds are for so many Americans and we regret that an IRS error caused a delay.”\n\nIf you still run into snags and snafus, remember the Recovery Rebate Credit.\n\nThose who find themselves without stimulus cash — from the first or second round — must turn to the Recovery Rebate Credit on Line 30 on the 1040 as their last resort.\n\nUnfortunately, it could mean that some facing financial challenges will have to wait until the first week of March to see their stimulus money.\n\nTaxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit face required delays by law even if they file as soon as the tax season starts.\n\nThe IRS noted, as of a Jan. 5 update online, that the EITC refund can be expected \"as soon as the first week of March if you file your return online, you choose to get your refund by direct deposit and we found no issues with your return.\n\nContactSusan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

But banks are building more buzz this summer by offering everything from $100 gift cards for NBA merchandise to $400 cash bonuses for opening new checking accounts.\n\nThrowing money on the table, of course, always gets people talking. But if you don't dig deep into what's required here, that so-called \"easy money\" could end up taking more cash out of your wallet than you'd expect.\n\n\"Banks want to make this account sticky. They want this to be your home base for a long period of time,\" said Claes Bell, a data analyst for Bankrate.com, who reviewed checking account promotions.\n\n\"It's important for people to look at the fine print.\"\n\nThis summer, I spotted cash bonus offers for opening a new checking account in newspaper ads, direct mail pitches sent to my home, and even envelopes that come in the mail stuffed with all sorts of coupons for restaurants and dry cleaners and others.\n\nI found a coupon for a $400 bonus for new customers who open a Chase Premier Plus Checking account and set up direct deposit. Chase said the $400 bonus is part of a test-marketing effort and was sent to a small sampling of individuals.\n\nBut here's an offer that some might want to refuse. Why? To avoid a monthly service fee, you must keep an average daily balance of $15,000 or more in checking, savings or other balances. Or you can have automatic payments to your qualifying linked Chase mortgage from your Chase account.\n\nOtherwise, you'd be hit with a $25 monthly service fee.\n\nA survey of promotions in the 10 largest U.S. markets indicated that cash bonuses can range from $50 to $400 for new customers who open a checking account, according to a review by Bankrate.com.\n\nMany times, the offers are made for a limited time, may only be available in specific markets or might be mailed to select consumers.\n\nBanks want your checking account business to be able to build a broader relationship, perhaps by marketing a credit card, brokerage services or a mortgage to you later.\n\n\"This is about acquiring customers more than it is about acquiring checking accounts,\" said Bell, of Bankrate.com.\n\nSome recent promotions:\n\nFifth Third Bank sent some direct mail promoting a $200 welcome bonus for opening a new Fifth Third Preferred Checking account in the Chicago area and Detroit.\n\nCitibank offered a $400 bonus regarding new checking accounts in markets including New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., according to the Bankrate.com survey.\n\nPNC Bank is offering up to $300 in all PNC markets. The bonuses start at the $50 level and apply to a new PNC Virtual Wallet.\n\nMichigan Schools & Government Credit Union is advertising a $100 cash bonus with a new checking account.\n\nA $100 gift card to the NBAStore.com was offered in Dallas and Houston by BBVA Compass, which has operations throughout the Sunbelt, according to Bankrate.com.\n\nBefore just opening an account, ask a few questions:\n\nIs there a fee to close the account?\n\nYou could face a closing fee, maybe $25 or so, or even lose the entire cash bonus, if you close that account too early.\n\nChase, for example, notes in its fine print that if the checking account is closed by the customer or Chase within six months after opening, the bank will deduct the bonus amount after closing.\n\nWhat's the minimum balance required to avoid a monthly service fee?\n\nIt doesn't make sense to sign up for a checking account to get a $200 bonus, if you'd end up spending $300 in a year on monthly service fees if you don't maintain the required minimum balance.\n\nA Fifth Third offer noted that its preferred checking has a $25 monthly fee, which is waived when deposit and investment accounts reach a combined total of $100,000 or more at any time during the month.\n\nHow often do you need to use a debit card?\n\nYou need to make at least 10 purchases with a PNC Bank Visa Debit Card to qualify for the bonus, along with other requirements, to get that bonus money deposited into your account.\n\nOthers might require that you make 40 purchases with a debit card within 30 days to get that bonus.\n\nIs bonus cash free money?\n\nNot according to the tax man. The bonus cash is treated as taxable interest income and reported to the Internal Revenue Service on IRS Form 1099-INT.\n\nIf you're in a 25% tax bracket, the $100 bonus only adds up to $75. It's even less if your tax bracket is higher.\n\nDo you really want to go through the hassle of closing an old checking account?\n\nNo one is required to close an old bank account before opening a new one somewhere else. But most bonus deals require that you sign up for direct deposit with that new account. Maybe you deposit part or all of your paycheck. Or a Social Security check.\n\nAnd the new account could require a minimum balance to avoid monthly fees.\n\nWill you need to re-do how you pay your bills? Will you need to make changes to get bills automatically paid from the new account, instead of the old one?\n\n\"Banks don't make it easy for you to switch your accounts,\" warned Bell, of Bankrate.com.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nESG investing — evaluating companies using environmental, social and governance factors — was one of the most-cited phrases in earnings calls during the first half of the year. But a looming recession, tanking stock markets and the race to US midterm elections have put those sustainability efforts on the chopping block.\n\nWhat’s happening: The rapid pandemic-era uptick in ESG fund investing has now stopped completely, according to Refinitiv analysis provided exclusively to CNN Business. ESG funds in September saw their largest outflow of investor cash since the March 2020 recession.\n\nThese ESG and responsible investing funds saw assets under management peak above $8.5 trillion in late 2021. Now, they stand under $7 trillion, according to new data from Refinitiv Lipper provided exclusively to Before the Bell.\n\nThe ESG world has been ravaged by ongoing debates about the merits of sustainable investing, the challenge of determining what counts as an ESG-friendly company and the evolution of global regulations. These headwinds, combined with a gloomy economic outlook, have created a less-than-appealing environment for ESG-related funds.\n\nPushback from all sides: US politicians on both sides of the aisle and business leaders have accused companies of “greenwashing” their financial statements to make themselves look more environmentally friendly than they really are. Firms like asset manager DWS and Goldman Sachs have been accused recently of using the ESG label undeservedly.\n\nIn May, Elon Musk called ESG a “Scam” on Twitter after Tesla was removed from an S&P ESG index while Exxon, which has a long history of causing environmental damage, remained. That’s because ESG ratings agencies tend to rate companies against others within their industry, so oil and gas companies are rated separately from automotive companies. They might rate an oil driller very highly relative to peers, but a renewable energy company may rate poorly compared to its own.\n\nThese counterintuitive results have added to a growing movement on the political right in the United States to divest entirely from asset management firms that invest and vote with ESG values in mind. Elected officials in red states have objected to the “values” they claim these funds promote, claiming that they’re not necessarily representative of their constituents.\n\nA large number of Republican-led states, 20 and counting, have said they will remove ESG-focused firms like BlackRock from managing assets in their state retirement plans. BlackRock has so far lost more than a billion dollars in commitments because of these changes, according to Robert Jenkins, head of Lipper Research at Refinitiv.\n\nA debate over how to regulate ESG funds is also adding to the noisy picture. Standardizing ESG criteria will reduce investor confusion, say experts, but the current fight to do so is actually making things more confusing. More than 1,000 ESG-related regulations have been issued for the global investment industry alone, according to an analysis by Principles for Responsible Investment, a United Nations-supported group that promotes ESG issues.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission most recently required funds labeled as ESG to invest at least 80% of assets in accordance with the funds stated ESG objectives, which is a step in the right direction, according to Jenkins.\n\nExecutives at a red light: The future doesn’t look great. US companies are preparing for recession by reconsidering their approach, according to a new KPMG poll. A third of CEOs in the US said they’ve already paused or reconsidered ESG initiatives, while another 59% say they’ll reconsider their efforts soon, the annual survey found. Even so, 70% of respondents said they’ve seen ESG programs improve the financial performance of their companies.\n\nWhat it means: Climate change could cost the US $2 trillion a year by 2100, according to the White House, and corporations and governments will have to make drastic changes to prevent even higher monetary and human costs. But the hurdles facing ESG investing show that doing so is easier said than done.\n\nBig banks respond to customers’ inflation woes\n\nInflation has people living paycheck to paycheck and now some banks are responding. This week, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), America’s largest bank, became the latest financial institution to offer customers early access to their direct deposits.\n\nChase announced that its 1.4 million secure banking customers will automatically receive access to certain direct deposits — such as paychecks, tax refunds, government benefits and pensions — up to two days earlier, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace.\n\nChase joins a growing list of fintechs and traditional financial institutions — including Chime, Current, Capital One (COF) and Wells Fargo (WFC) — to offer customers early access to their money. Also, in the past year, several banks such as Bank of America, Citi and Chase have started scrapping overdraft fees, which have come under fire from Democrats.\n\nServices such as early access to direct deposits and waiving of overdraft fees come at a time when historically high inflation is draining consumers’ excess savings, said Mark Hamrick, chief economist for Bankrate.\n\n“At a time when prices have been high on a continuing basis, that has robbed consumers of purchasing power,” he said. “It means that every dollar that is in the bank is increasingly precious.”\n\nThe bottom line: Early access to direct deposits is another way for big banks to compete with fintechs like Chime and Current in the emerging war for customer relationships.\n\nLast year, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon promised that the bank would keep pace with its emerging fintech rivals. “We will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space,” Dimon said during an earnings call.\n\nMore trouble at the Fed\n\nJames Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a voting Fed policymaker, spoke directly about monetary policy at an off-the-record, invitation-only forum held by Citigroup last Friday.\n\nA transcript of the event, which was released by the St. Louis Fed only after the New York Times reported on the story, shows that Bullard discussed market reaction to Fed news as well as his view that another three-quarter-point rate increase could be appropriate at the December Fed meeting.\n\nCritics say that a Fed official sharing new information with large banks and their clients is an ethical violation and lowers the public credibility of the Fed. Some are even calling for his resignation.\n\n“Jim Bullard is one of the Fed officials that is making a decision about rate hikes that have effects in the United States, will have effects for US workers, and they are having effects around the globe, said Claudia Sahm, Senior Fellow at the Jain Family Institute and a former Federal Reserve economist, on Bloomberg Friday morning. ” The idea that he gave any kind of private remarks to investors is outrageous, and he should go.”\n\nThe St. Louis Fed said Thursday that it will “think differently” in the future following criticisms about Bullard’s appearance, according to Bloomberg.\n\nUp next\n\nThird-quarter earnings from Hyundai (HYMTF), Philips (PSX) and Discover (DFS).\n\nComing later this week:\n\n▸ Conference Board Consumer Confidence, September new home sales and pending home sales, US GDP, September Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index.\n\n▸ Third quarter earnings from Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO), Meta (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), McDonald’s (MCD), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/17/coronavirus-stimulus-checks-where-missing-money-going/5144515002/", "title": "Coronavirus stimulus checks: Where is the missing money going?", "text": "Americans are reaching out to tax preparers and lining up at their offices around the country to find out what happened to their stimulus checks.\n\nOne answer: The IRS sent those missing payouts to an intermediary bank account if a client got an advance on their tax return, tax professionals say.\n\nClients tipped tax preparers off to the problem when they used Get My Payment, the government’s new stimulus deposit tracking portal, and uncovered that the payments of up to $1,200 for individuals were sent to an account number they didn't recognize.\n\nAgencies that help people file for government-issued refunds are receiving an influx of calls regarding the one-time payout meant to be disbursed to 80 million Americans this week. While many people received the deposit, other payments may have gotten inadvertently sent to temporary accounts created during the tax filing process.\n\nThe IRS said it is moving to provide additional information and resolve any problems as soon as possible.\n\nWhere are stimulus checks going?\n\nNatalie Parchment, a tax preparation consultant in the Washington, D.C., area, has been inundated with calls and emails from clients wondering what happened to their payout.\n\n“I had to investigate,” Parchment said.\n\nShe discovered that the unrecognized digits people found listed on the portal were linked to refund transfers accounts, often created on behalf of taxpayers who want preparation fees taken out of refunds so they don’t have to pay preparers upfront.\n\n“Those last four digits on the Get My Payment portal match the transfer provider's information that has been submitted to the IRS,” Parchment said.\n\nAfter you file your taxes with a tax professional, transfer banks such as MetaBank, Republic Bank and Santa Barbara Tax Product Group set up temporary accounts for taxpayers who want a refund advance or to deduct tax preparation fees from a refund.\n\nThat account number and the bank's routing number are sent off with the tax return to the IRS.\n\nThe IRS deposited some stimulus checks into these temporary accounts, according to MetaBank. \"The IRS has not explained to us why this error occurred,\" MetaBanks said in a statement.\n\nWhy are checks deposited in wrong accounts?\n\nThe issue has popped up among filers who have set up a tax advance in previous years when filing tax returns, according to Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas, Nevada. The IRS is basing stimulus checks off tax returns from 2018 or 2019, whichever is more recent.\n\nA tax advance typically works like this: When a tax preparer does a filer’s return, they can loan them a portion of their refund in advance. The IRS will then send the actual refund to the preparer via a bank account set up in the filer’s name. The loan is repaid from the refund, and the remaining portion of the refund is returned to the filer.\n\nEveryone from mom-and-pop tax preparers to big chains like TurboTax, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt have this option, Mathis said.\n\nThe issue is that the account where the stimulus payment was deposited didn't belong to the taxpayer. It belonged to the service provider.\n\n\"The provider’s bank is supposed to refund the $1,200 payment back to IRS in these cases,\" says Evan Morgan, tax director at Kaufman Rossin.\n\nThose intermediary accounts tend to only be used for a filer’s refund in previous years, so those accounts likely no longer exist. The IRS hasn’t given out specific guidance yet on how they will reissue stimulus checks if they are deposited in the wrong accounts. But normally if a bank account is closed, a tax refund is rejected and the IRS sends out a paper check to the address that was on the return.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAnother possibility is a bank will return those funds if the money lands in the wrong account since the name on the deposit didn't match the name on the person’s bank account, Mathis explained. If the funds are rejected, the IRS would likely issue a paper check to the last address on file, he said.\n\n“For people who have moved, that could be a big problem,” Mathis says. “People are already having a heck of a time trying to update their information on the IRS website.”\n\nThe IRS is expected to start sending paper checks on April 24.\n\n\"If a payment is returned to the IRS, the agency will mail a check to the taxpayer,\" according to the Santa Barbara Tax Products Group which takes tax preparation fees out of refunds.\n\nWho has been affected?\n\nAfter people in San Antonio, Texas, complained about the missing checks to Snapback Tax Services, the local agency blamed the IRS for the error.\n\n\"The information that many of you are seeing on the IRS website is your account information to MetaBank. They are the bank that processes your tax refunds,\" Snapback Tax Services said on Facebook.\n\nIn Augusta, Georgia, dozens of people crowded Citi Tax Financial, thinking the tax preparer was responsible for lost checks, according to local media.\n\nA similar event unfolded in Tallahassee, Florida, this week after confused residents stood outside of Galaxy Tax Services with tax papers in hand.\n\nH&R Block, the tax preparation company, said its clients were impacted by the confusion the IRS created.\n\n\"We share our clients’ frustration that many of them have not yet received these much-needed payments due to IRS decisions,'' the company said in a statement provided to USA TODAY, \"We are actively working with the IRS to get stimulus payments sent directly to client accounts.''", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/06/19/fake-savings-bond-scheme/70334120007/", "title": "Fake savings bonds create trouble for people trying to cash real ones", "text": "Sure, we've heard of the feds seizing all sorts of shady items – glitzy Rolex watches, well-done counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbags, lookalike Gucci earrings.\n\nWho would imagine, though, that crooks are cranking out anything as dull as counterfeit U.S. Savings Bonds? And that they're hauling them to the bank to cash them?\n\nAuthorities claimed that $1 million in counterfeit savings bonds showed up at South Texas banks as part of one crackdown on a scheme to steal money by cashing phony savings bonds, including inflation-indexed or I Bonds, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nNationwide losses are estimated at over $50 million, according to an alert issued earlier this year by the Oklahoma Bankers Association.\n\nReal savers run into real headaches\n\nOne reader complained to me that all her daughter wanted to do was cash one, legitimate Series EE savings bond for $5,000 when she was visiting home in Michigan. She had an account for many years. But the Chase bank wouldn't let her cash the bond.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nChase told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, that it never stopped cashing savings bonds. Chase will cash U.S. savings bonds for customers who have banked with Chase for more than a year. But there are limits on how much in savings bonds can be cashed and how much money you can get on the spot.\n\n\"We offer up to $500 redemption value – purchase price plus interest – at all of our branches,\" according to a spokesperson for Chase.\n\nOtherwise, Chase customers and noncustomers would need to cash their savings bonds by mail through TreasuryDirect.gov.\n\nActual savers are finding it tougher in many cases to cash U.S. savings bonds at the bank after crooks cashed phony paper bonds in several states.\n\nMany times, savers haul stacks of savings bonds, not just one or two bonds, to the bank to cash after decades of saving.\n\nBack in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, workers regularly set aside money toward paper savings bonds from each paycheck through employer-sponsored payroll savings plans. People kept their paper bonds in everything from safe deposit boxes to shoe boxes or plastic bags.\n\nWe saw 401(k) plans enter the scene in 1978 and not every employer offered one. The U.S. Treasury stopped issuing paper savings bonds through traditional employer-sponsored payroll savings plans in 2011.\n\nMany long-term savers only cash their bonds once they stopped earning interest after 30 years. Some lost track of their bonds and cashed them later. I remember taking my dear, hardworking, hard-saving mother to the bank, and, believe me, she often wasn't cashing just one or two savings bonds.\n\nMany banks once cashed savings bonds for non-customers but no longer do that. Huntington Bank, for example, stopped redeeming U.S. savings bonds for non-customers as of Feb. 16, 2022.\n\nLast year, the Treasury allowed banks to stop cashing savings bonds for someone who wasn't a customer or someone who is a new customer. Some banks now require that you be a customer for at least one year before being able to cash savings bonds.\n\nComerica Bank will cash U.S savings bonds – Series E, Series EE, and Series I – at banking centers for existing customers who have had accounts for more than six months. But new customers and non-customers are referred to the U.S., Department of the Treasury via the website TreasuryDirect.gov.\n\nA bank can decline to cash that bond, too, if the bank has a reason to doubt the authenticity of the bond or is concerned about the ID or trustworthiness of the person cashing it.\n\nAbout 88% of paper savings bonds are redeemed at banks, but banks have the option of refusing to redeem bonds in certain situations, according to a spokesperson for the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service.\n\nHow does the savings bond scam work?\n\nThe bigger the face value, the tougher that savings bond could be to cash, in some cases. Scammers often try to pass off fake Series EE savings bonds that are in denominations of $5,000 or $10,000 each, according to an alert issued in February by the Oklahoma Bankers Association.\n\nCriminals open a bank account, sometimes online. One person went to multiple branches and redeemed a few fake bonds at a time, according to the banking trade group. Some savvy tellers spot the fraud, but others don't and that's why banks are changing some rules.\n\nWe're talking about a good deal of money even with one or two bonds. Interest builds and, for example, three old Series EE bonds with a face value of $5,000 each can add up to be worth more than $30,000 together.\n\nCon artists might deposit the bond money into the account but then withdraw the money before the financial institution finds out, through the U.S. Treasury, that the savings bonds were fake. The Treasury later makes an adjustment that leaves the bank or credit union on the hook for the lost money.\n\nOne alert to credit unions noted that some employees used a TreasuryDirect.gov website to calculate the value of the bonds without realizing the tool doesn't verify if the bonds are legitimate.\n\n\"The U.S. Treasury adjustments can take several days to weeks, which unfortunately aids the fraudster,\" according to an alert last year by the CUNA Mutual Group, an insurance company that provides services to credit unions and others.\n\nCounterfeit savings bonds trigger problems for banks\n\nBanks are on the hook if they end up handing out cash when a counterfeit savings bond is redeemed, unless the Department of the Treasury can determine the financial institution was not at fault or negligent. The Treasury issued a 22-page booklet to banks, revised in October, that outlines various scenarios of when not to cash a bond.\n\nBanks, for example, are told not to cash bonds if:\n\nAny information on those bonds or notes has been altered.\n\nAny noticeable irregularities appear, such as an odd texture or feel to the bond.\n\nThe bonds are mutilated or defaced in any way.\n\nThe person who is trying to cash the bonds seems suspicious or the bonds look suspicious.\n\nDo not buy savings bonds from someone else or through an online auction site. \"You cannot cash them,\" according to TreasuryDirect.gov. \"You can only cash savings bonds that you own or co-own unless you have legal evidence or other documentation that we accept to show you are entitled to cash the bond.\"\n\nWhile some of these counterfeit savings bonds look authentic, the Treasury warns the color of the counterfeit bond is more of \"a pale-yellow or pale-peach color. Authentic bonds are a rich-peach color.\"\n\nThink about it, though, when is the last time you looked at a U.S. savings bond? Many tellers might not be familiar with how savings bonds should look. And the texture of real paper savings bonds issued over time isn't the same across the board.\n\nSome savers face a long wait for savings bond money\n\nGo to your bank to cash your savings bonds and research your options.\n\nI took an old $200 face value Series EE savings bond – now worth about $461 – to a regional bank where we have an account this week and they said they would cash it. (See TreasuryDirect.gov for a calculator to find out how much a paper bond is worth. You need to serial number and issue date of that bond to calculate it.)\n\nOne bond is one thing; a bigger batch of bonds could be another.\n\nIf you're cashing 10 or more bonds at Huntington, for example, the teller or relationship banker might calculate the interest and redemption values within one or two business days. They'd call later to tell you the amount and ask you to return to endorse the bonds to redeem them, said Samantha Myers, communications manager for Huntington National Bank.\n\nGiven the levels of fraud, it's logical that some banks changed their rules.\n\nUnfortunately, the wait could take months, if you can't find a bank to cash all of your bonds.\n\nIf the bank won't cash your savings bond, you need to go to the TreasuryDirect.gov website to read instructions for cashing savings bonds by mail. You're going to need to mail in the paper bonds and fill out an FS Form 1522 found online at TreasuryDirect.gov.\n\nThe form gives specifics, such as the Minneapolis post office box for mailing these bonds.\n\nThe TreasuryDirect site says online that it can take 13 weeks to process a claim to cash a savings bond. (If you're trying to research missing bonds, the TreasuryDirect site notes that it will take at least six months to process.)\n\nThe average time it takes the Bureau of Fiscal Service to complete a simple bond redemption is about 25 business days, according to a bureau spokesperson. But he said it can take up to 13 weeks in the case of complex redemption cases.\n\n\"If a bondholder wishes to redeem their bond, we encourage them to start with their bank,\" he said.\n\nWaiting three months or more to get your money is distressing, especially if you expect to walk into a bank and cash a savings bond and get money on the spot.\n\nSavers who need money quickly – say for a down payment on a home or college tuition – need to keep the new hurdles in mind. U.S. savings bonds bought in 1992 and earlier have stopped earning interest so you'd want to make sure to cash those bonds.\n\nNo one is going to send you any notice that your savings bonds need to be cashed or automatically redeem these bonds for you. It's up to you to track your savings bonds.\n\nHere's another tidbit: If you run across an old Series HH savings bond sitting in a drawer, you need to know that the HH Bond cannot be cashed at all at the bank.\n\nSavers who are cashing these specific paper bonds – which will stop paying interest after 20 years from the issue date – must have a bank account where the Treasury can send the money. The Treasury only redeems these HH Bonds via direct deposit. You'd also need to complete FS Form 1522 – giving instructions for direct deposit on that form.\n\nIf the HH bond is less than 20 years old, it is paying interest to you via direct deposit.\n\nThe Series HH bonds were sold from 1980 through August 2004 and are no longer being issued.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

There were 618 votes against unionizing and 380 in favor. Out of approximately 1,633 eligible voters, 998 votes were counted. There were no challenged ballots. Two ballots were voided.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said the company is “glad that our team at LDJ5 were able to have their voices heard. We look forward to continuing to work directly together as we strive to make every day better for our employees.”\n\nWhile the ALU did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for comment, it tweeted: “The organizing will continue at this facility and beyond. The fight has just begun.”\n\nBoth parties have five business days to file any objections.\n\nThe LDJ5 election drew significant attention from prominent labor leaders, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who rallied with Amazon workers on Staten Island a day before the election started.\n\nThe ALU’s unlikely success in its first election at Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse, which employs more than 8,000 workers and is also located on Staten Island, is viewed as a milestone event with potential broader implications for Amazon’s sprawling network of facilities. The win quickly drew praise from advocacy groups, established labor unions and the White House.\n\nFollowing the LDJ5 result, Teamsters general president Sean O’Brien, who recently met with ALU leaders following the JFK8 victory, signaled a continued focus on organizing Amazon workers. “The fight at Amazon continues. The only thing this greedy, abusive company won today is a guarantee that Amazon workers everywhere will not give up until they have a union,” said O’Brien in a statement. AFL-CIO presdient Liz Shuler tweeted that it “stands in solidarity” with the ALU worker organizers “who are changing the world and just getting started.”\n\nAccording to John Logan, a professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, the results are no doubt a disappointment for the union. “If it had won, things could have solidified for the union in a big way,” he said. But the stakes were higher for Amazon, Logan argued.\n\n“A second defeat could have proved fatal to the company’s efforts to stop the organizing from spreading like wildfire, just as it has done at Starbucks,” he said.\n\nALU’s organizing efforts grew out of tensions between Amazon and Staten Island workers over the company’s pandemic response along with existing frustrations about working conditions. Amazon’s workplace has been under scrutiny for its high turnover rates and on-the-job injuries in recent years.\n\nChristian Smalls, who was fired by Amazon at the start of the pandemic and is now ALU’s president, called the JFK8 win “a catalyst for a revolution with Amazon workers, just like the Starbucks unionizing effort” in an interview with CNN last month. “We want to have the same domino effect.”\n\nFollowing Monday’s result, Smalls tweeted: “Despite todays outcome I’m proud of the worker/organizers of LDJ5 they had a tougher challenge after our victory at JFK8.”\n\nHe added that ALU “will continue to organize and so should all of you”\n\nAmazon has repeatedly said in statements that its “employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union,” while spending millions on consultants to combat unions last year alone and running an anti-union campaign inside the facilities. Amazon said it was “disappointed” with the JFK8 results and laid out a number of objections to the previous Staten Island union vote as it called for a do-over; an NLRB hearing on the matter is scheduled for later this month. (A tally of votes last month in a separate re-election at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama organized by an established labor union were too close to call. The NLRB expects to hold a hearing on the matter but it has not yet been scheduled.)\n\n“All the issues are the same. Of course there are differences between the buildings, but we need the union at JFK8. We need the union at LDJ5. We need the union at all Amazon warehouses all across the world,” said ALU’s treasurer and LDJ5 employee, Madeline Wesley, at a union rally ahead of the LDJ5 election. “This is just the beginning.”\n\nAs ALU organizers focused on rallying support for the vote at the JFK8 election, Amazon was messaging its stance on unionizing to workers inside LDJ5, several workers told CNN Business last week at the rally ahead of the election. After the JFK8 result, the ALU’s attention turned to LDJ5.\n\nJustine Medina, a JFK8 warehouse worker and ALU organizer, told CNN Business last week that due to the smaller size of LDJ5, Amazon’s efforts may have been more effective. “It is just so much more intense,” said Medina.\n\nLDJ5 worker Andrew Perez told CNN Business last week that he was pulled into required meetings in recent weeks where company representatives offered their stance on unions, including harping on union dues. Perez said at the time he anticipated the election results would be close.\n\nIn recent weeks, there have been a number of new developments and attention paid to Amazon’s treatment of, and relationship to, its warehouse workforce.\n\nAmazon disclosed in a filing last month that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch would lead a racial equity audit of its US hourly employees to “evaluate any disparate racial impacts” of its policies and practices. The move comes as Amazon faces shareholder pressure to undergo a racial equity audit in a proposal slated to come up to vote at the company’s annual meeting later this month.\n\nMeanwhile, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo issued a memo taking issue with one of the ways employers like Amazon seek to combat union drives — through so-called captive audience meetings, or required meetings where companies convey their anti-union stance. While currently legally permissible, Abruzzo called on the agency to reconsider the legality of required attendance at such meetings. Amazon previously declined to comment on Abruzzo’s memo.\n\nAnd in a win for the ALU, an NLRB administrative law judge found that Amazon had violated labor law in its firing of a JFK8 employee named Gerald Bryson, who is an ALU organizer. Bryson, like Smalls, was fired by Amazon in March 2020 after protesting pandemic-related workplace safety precautions. While Amazon has denied retaliating against Bryson, the judge ordered Bryson be reinstated and paid his lost wages. (In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said, “we strongly disagree with the NLRB judge’s ruling,” and that it plans to appeal.)\n\nOver the weekend, Amazon notified workers that it is ending its paid Covid-19 sick leave policy, and that it would no longer notify workers of positive cases in its facilities unless required to do so by law.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/us/california-family-found-dead-thursday/index.html", "title": "Suspect in deaths of California family arrested for kidnapping and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA suspect already in custody in connection with the kidnapping and killing of four California family members – including a baby girl – was formally arrested late Thursday in the case, a sheriff’s office said.\n\nJesus Manuel Salgado, 48, was arrested on four counts of murder and four counts of kidnapping, Merced County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Alexandra Britton said.\n\nSalgado is accused of kidnapping the four – 8-month-old Aroohi Dheri, her parents Jasleen Kaur and Jasdeep Singh, and her uncle Amandeep Singh – from the victims’ central California family trucking business on Monday and killing them that day, authorities said.\n\nThe bodies of the four were found in a farm area in central California’s Merced County on Wednesday evening, with a farmworker alerting authorities to finding at least some of the remains in an orchard there, authorities said.\n\nWednesday’s discovery, which came a day after Salgado was detained as a suspect, was announced by a visibly emotional sheriff who said the killings were “completely and totally senseless.”\n\n“There’s a special place in hell for this guy,” Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke said Wednesday night, referring to the suspect.\n\n“A whole family (was) wiped out, and we still don’t know why,” Warnke said.\n\nThe family was kidnapped at gunpoint – an abduction recorded on surveillance video – from their trucking business Monday morning in Merced, authorities said.

CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for him, and calls to family members have gone unanswered.\n\nSalgado was previously in prison for nearly a decade after being convicted of attempted false imprisonment, first degree robbery and possession of a controlled substance, according to records from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nIn the previous case, Salgado was sentenced to 11 years in January 2007. He was released on parole in June 2015, and his parole supervision ended in June 2018, the department told CNN in an email.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Our worst fears were realized': Sheriff makes announcement about missing family 00:56 - Source: kmph\n\nKidnapping of ‘peace-loving’ family caught on video\n\nEarlier Wednesday, authorities released surveillance footage of the kidnapping at the family’s Merced trucking business Monday morning.\n\nThe video shows Jasdeep Singh arriving at the business’ parking lot at 8:30 a.m., followed by Amandeep Singh arriving nine minutes later.\n\nShortly before 9 a.m., Jasdeep is seen encountering a man outside the business.

If completed, it could be one of the largest tracts of land conserved during Biden’s first term.\n\n“When it comes to Spirit Mountain and the surrounding canyons and regions in southern Nevada, I’m committed to protecting this sacred place that is essential to the creation story of so many tribes that are here today,” Biden said. His remarks were met with cheers from the audience at the tribal nations summit.\n\nSpirit Mountain – known as Avi Kwa Ame in Mojave language – sits in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts in Southern Nevada and is a sacred site for over 10 tribal nations. Of the proposals being considered, one from Democratic Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada would conserve close to 450,000 acres of land around Spirit Mountain. However, the administration is also considering other options.\n\nTop Interior Department officials, including Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – have held public roundtables and community meetings with local tribal leaders and members of Nevada’s congressional delegation.

However, there is a pending application for a solar project on about 2,575 acres that BLM has identified as exempt from conservation, an Interior spokesperson said.\n\nOutside of the proposed monument area, BLM has identified more than nine million acres of federal land that could be used to build utility-scale solar panels, as well as 16.8 million acres of federal land that could be developed for onshore wind.\n\nNevada lawmakers, including recently reelected Democratic Sen.

Its name comes from the Havasupai words baaj nwaavjo for “where Indigenous peoples roam,” and the Hopi words i’tah kukveny for “our ancestral footprints.”\n\nThe Biden administration also announced it would spend $44 million to strengthen climate resilience across the national parks system. Arizona's Saguaro National Park will receive money to restore desert habitats by removing buffelgrass, an invasive plant species that displaces native plants and fuels destructive wildfires.\n\nThe president was joined by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., Reps. Raúl Grijalva and Greg Stanton, both D-Ariz., Secretary of State Adrian Fontes and leaders from more than a dozen tribal communities who consider the area culturally significant.\n\n\"America's natural wonders are our nation's heart and soul,\" the president said. \"There is no natural treasure, none that is grander than the Grand Canyon.\" Protecting it, he said, meant protecting an enduring symbol of the nation for the whole world.\n\nMaya Tilousi-Lyttle, a member of the Havasupai and Hopi tribes and a senior at Cactus Shadows High School in Cave Creek, introduced Biden at the ceremony.\n\n\"Standing here represents the unity of the tribes to protect our ancestral lands,\" she said. \"That's where I learned a deep respect for our land and water.\"\n\nTilousi-Lyttle, the daughter of Carletta Tilousi, a former Havasupai council member, said she was honored to represent the tribes who fought to protect their homeland, its abundant natural resources and to fight for environmental justice for all people.\n\n\"I'm here representing the next generation that has the responsibility to continue this vital work. This is our home and we're committed to its protection.\"\n\nBiden signed the proclamation near Red Butte, a site considered sacred by several Arizona Indigenous communities. Tribal leaders and activists have long called for the federal government to better protect a region that has played important roles for Indigenous peoples for centuries.\n\n“Native American history is American history,” Haaland said, and this monument will give tribal members a voice in managing lands where they and their ancestors have long lived, farmed and prayed.\n\n“The president and this administration see Indian Country,” said Haaland, herself a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe. “I am speaking to you as the first Native American cabinet member as a testament to that. Feeling seen means being appreciated for who we are, the original stewards of our shared lands and waters.”\n\nBiden arrived in Tusayan around 6:30 p.m. Monday, met by Reps. Raúl Grijalva and Ruben Gallego, both D-Ariz. The president plans to announce on Tuesday his creation of a monument to be managed under a co-stewardship system with tribes with deep connections to the canyon and region. Officials said a commission will be appointed to determine how co-stewardship will progress.\n\nThe monument will span 917,618 acres of federal forest and range lands, including the Marble Canyon area in the northeast, Kaibab National Forest lands south of Grand Canyon, and areas around the Kanab Creek drainage on the west side of the Kaibab Plateau.\n\nThe monument is slightly smaller than the 1.1 million-acre footprint that had been proposed. Administration officials said private and state inholdings within the monument will not be included. Biden invoked the federal Antiquities Act to create the monument, and Hobbs said Tuesday she could think of no better use for the law than to protect the area, which she called \"first and foremost culturally significant\" as the state's namesake feature.\n\nThe designation will make permanent the moratorium on new uranium claims in much of the acreage where President Barack Obama imposed it in 2012. It will protect existing livestock grazing leases and hunting, fishing and recreational access.\n\nBiden will also use his northern Arizona visit to draw attention to a $44 million investment from the Inflation Reduction Act in climate resilience across the national parks system.\n\n'A sacred place':Advocates for new Grand Canyon protections rally in hopes Biden will act\n\nMonument will raise new debate over uranium mining\n\nThe new monument is already drawing critical reaction. Although it won't shut down valid existing mineral claims, including one at a uranium mine south of Tusayan called the Pinyon Plain Mine, the company operating that mine, Energy Fuels, Inc., said the administration’s opposition to uranium mining in the region harms America’s nuclear energy industry and the larger effort at creating carbon-free energy.\n\n“These small, highly protective mines that contain lots of carbon-free energy should be celebrated, not vilified,” Energy Fuels spokesman Curtis Moore said. “We implore people to follow the science.”\n\nTribes, especially the Havasupai people whose reservation is in the Canyon and contains aquamarine springs that flow to the Colorado River, worry that uranium mining will contaminate their water and all life in the area. Havasupai Tribal Councilwoman Dianna Sue White Dove Uqualla said the whole region, from the Pinyon Plain Mine to Havasupai Falls and beyond, is sacred to the tribe.\n\nThe monument, with its inclusive management plan, is a critical nod to the wisdom of ancestors both Native and non-Native, she said. “It’s really something that has to be now,” she said. “It’s for all two-legged people on the world.”\n\nThe Grand Canyon has always been a place where tribes welcomed each other to practice their cultures and take spiritual medicine from the waters, Uqualla said. She praised the administration for tapping tribal knowledge of the area and said the collaborative stewardship will benefit all who love the Grand Canyon region. “It will help us all come together,” she said.\n\nHavasupai officials invited Haaland to their reservation earlier this year for what the Interior secretary on Monday described as one of the most meaningful trips of her life.\n\n“I hiked many majestic miles down to Supai Village,” Haaland said, “where I had the honor of visiting Havasupai Falls and experiencing the clear, blue-green waters that flow from the spring-fed streams. I witnessed the deep connection that the Havasupai people have with the land and the waters that have sustained them since time immemorial.”\n\nThe question of whether current or historic uranium mining threatens those or other waters entering the Colorado River at the Grand Canyon is a matter of debate. Mining supporters point to U.S. Geological Survey analysis that did not find evidence of contamination, while opponents say there are insufficient test wells or data to determine where or when contaminated groundwater might surface.\n\nHistory and culture:Indigenous people find legal, cultural barriers to protect sacred spaces off tribal lands\n\nA history of presidents creating monuments\n\nBiden’s Grand Canyon-area announcement echoes a similar but more politically contentious trip that then-President Bill Clinton made to the national park in 1996. That’s when Clinton, on the re-election trail, announced his creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, in part to head off coal mining there.\n\nTwo decades later, then-President Barack Obama designated Utah’s Bears Ears National Monument, in part to protect Native American ancestral and sacred sites. Both of those monuments faced fierce opposition within Utah, and the Trump administration would later downsize them before Biden restored protections.\n\nIn March, Biden designated a monument in southern Nevada, Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain that Indigenous communities in Nevada, California and Arizona consider sacred.\n\nThose exercises of a president’s Antiquity Act powers to preserve areas of cultural or scientific significance differed from this newest monument in that both Arizona senators support it. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Arizona, also has advocated for a Grand Canyon-area monument since the Obama administration, and on Monday he thanked the administration and others who made it happen.\n\n“First and foremost, I want to extend my sincerest and most heartfelt gratitude to the tribes who have stood firm in their quest to make the Grand Canyon a beacon of conservation and cultural preservation, no matter the obstacle or threat,” Grijalva said in a written statement. “Standing alongside them on this journey has been one of the greatest honors of my life.”\n\nMohave County, which includes the new monument’s northwestern segment, opposed its creation and was scheduled to host Republican state lawmakers for a public hearing about it Monday evening.

He used his authority under the Antiquities Act to proclaim national monuments on federal lands that contain historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, or other objects of historic or scientific interest.\n\n\"When we conserve our country's natural gifts, we're not just protecting the livelihoods of people who depend on them ... we're protecting the heart and the soul of our national pride,\" Biden said. \"We're protecting pieces of history.\"\n\nBiden also directed Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to consider initiating a new National Marine Sanctuary designation within the next 30 days to protect all U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands.\n\nCastner Range, located on Fort Bliss and within the Chihuahuan desert along the Rio Grande, is the ancestral homeland of the Comanche and Apache people, and its cultural ecology is considered sacred to several Indigenous communities.\n\nCastner Range also served as a training and testing site for the U.S. Army during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\n\"When you see it, it's just breathtaking, transforming desert plains into a sea of vibrant yellow and orange framed with a rugged mountain and blue sky,\" Biden said.\n\nThe Avi Kwa Ame, also known as Spirit Mountain, is known as a sacred burial ground by the Mojave, Chemehuevi and some Southern Paiute people and is important to other Tribal Nations and Indigenous Peoples. It’s also home to one of the world’s largest Joshua tree forests and provides continuous habitat or migration corridors for species such as the desert bighorn sheep and desert tortoise.\n\n\"I look forward to visiting it myself,\" Biden said.\n\nTogether, the new national monuments will protect nearly 514,000 acres of public land.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

But he bypassed some of the most critical Western terrain for Democrats in November: Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn both states, contests for governor and Senate, along with a handful of House races, could well tip the political dynamic for the second half of Biden’s first term – and determine which party controls the levers of government in two key presidential battlegrounds for 2024.\n\nThe calibrated approach reflects an election year reality: Biden remains an unpopular leader for Democrats, even as many of his policies – like infrastructure investments and new climate and health care legislation – prove broadly popular. Instead of stumping alongside some of this year’s most vulnerable candidates, Biden is using events in Democratic strongholds to highlight his achievements, make the case for his party and raise millions of dollars from donors.\n\n“President Biden knows where he’s wanted and where he’s not wanted,” a top Democratic official who works closely with the White House told CNN. “This isn’t his first midterm campaign.”\n\nThe President – who regularly talks to Democratic candidates and carefully tracks races for House, Senate and governor – has told advisers that he believes his best contribution to the midterm election campaign is using his megaphone to draw a sharp contrast with rivals whom he frequently derides as extreme “MAGA Republicans.”\n\nSince the start of September, Biden has appeared with a smattering of Democratic candidates, including during a Labor Day swing through Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and last week in upstate New York. But he’s held only a handful of large rallies and has twice been forced to postpone plans for a major political event in Florida – once because he contracted Covid and again for Hurricane Ian – but he is set to return before Election Day, party aides said.\n\nCandidates often seem more eager to appear with Biden when he is making an official appearance, like he did in Colorado on Wednesday with Sen. Michael Bennet – a loud advocate for designating Camp Hale, a high-altitude former training ground for the revered 10th Mountain Division, a national monument.\n\n“He came to the White House, and he said, ‘I told you what I need,’” Biden said during the event after bringing Bennet on stage. “And I said I’ll do it. You know why? I was worried he’d never leave the damn White House.”\n\nIn his bid for reelection, Bennet is encountering a far more competitive contest than he once imagined, facing Republican newcomer Joe O’Dea, who owns a Denver construction company and his making his first run for office. But Biden won Colorado by 13 percentage points, which makes it a far more hospitable environment for a presidential visit.\n\nAvoiding nationalizing critical races\n\nIt’s a much different story in neighboring Arizona or Nevada, where Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Catherine Cortez Masto are locked in two of the most difficult races of the year – in part because Republicans are seeking to link them to Biden and his administration’s policies.\n\nAt a debate last week, Kelly pushed back on the hot-button topic of immigration and sought to separate himself from his party and the White House.\n\n“I’ve stood up to Democrats when they’re wrong on this issue – including the President,” Kelly said. “When the President decided he was going to do something dumb on this and change the rules that would create a bigger crisis, I told him he was wrong.”\n\nThe White House is working closely with the Senate and House campaign committees and will send the President where he could be helpful, aides said, and will avoid traveling to areas where nationalizing the race would be seen as a detriment to candidates. The logistics of presidential travel also complicate some travel, aides said, because campaigns must help foot the expensive costs of Air Force One.\n\nHe has been deployed multiple times per week to raise money with donors: In ritzy New York or Boston apartments, Los Angeles backyards and even during virtual events. Biden was expected to appear alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday evening for an event in Los Angeles, raising millions of dollars for House Democrats.\n\nHe is set to headline a fundraiser October 20 in Philadelphia for John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate nominee, and is also scheduled to stop earlier in the day in western Pennsylvania. The commonwealth is not only the home of Biden’s birth, but also the site of one of the most competitive Senate contests in the country and has drawn frequent visits from Biden.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for sitting presidents to be more of a draw for donors than voters. In the lead-up to the 2014 midterms, then-President Barack Obama attended fundraisers multiple days a week, but wasn’t a frequent presence with Democratic candidates on the campaign trail.\n\nA pragmatic view of the campaign trail\n\nFor Biden, this election marks the 50th anniversary of winning his first Senate race in Delaware. Since 1972, he has had a front-row seat to the highs and lows of Election Day, which history shows is almost always unkind to the President’s party.\n\nBiden has always been pragmatic about his campaign trail draw: “I’ll come campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most,” he occasionally says in his speeches, a mantra he’s employed for decades.\n\nComing out of the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden’s aides said the President was eager to begin a more intensive travel schedule, including to tout his accomplishments and boost Democrats. After a winning streak over the summer, which included passage of key Democratic priorities in Congress and a decline in gas prices, Biden was particularly keen on speaking with Americans about what he’d achieved.\n\nViews of the President have slowly inched upward from a summertime slump, with 44% of American adults now approving of his of performance, according to the latest CNN poll, which is up from 38% in June and July polling.\n\nHis ratings have climbed 9 percentage points among Democrats and 8 points among independents since that previous poll, with the President’s image also seeing a 17-point improvement among Black Americans and an 11-point increase among adults younger than 45.\n\nThe White House is taking a measure of solace in those findings, advisers say, even as concern over inflation and the broader economy remain a significant challenge for the President.\n\nThe President’s aides are also closely monitoring an uptick in gas prices, spurred partly by certain refineries going offline for maintenance. For some of Biden’s senior team, no metric is more important ahead of November.\n\nDespite the uptick in Biden’s approval, the latest CNN poll found that 47% of voters say Biden will not be a factor in their midterm election vote. But among those who say they are sending a message through their November vote, 28% say it’s a vote in opposition to Biden, with only 23% saying it’s a vote to support his policies.\n\nA late push ahead of November 8\n\nIn the final stretch of the midterm election campaign, the President is scheduled to be on the road several days a week, aides said, promoting the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Act and other achievements of the administration. Advisers say his schedule includes ribbon-cutting ceremonies and groundbreaking events – all of which are designed to generate local news coverage.\n\nIn some cases, Biden has appeared in states that neighbor critical battlegrounds, allowing him to promote his agenda without directly inserting himself into individual races. In September, Biden promoted the infrastructure law and his cancer moonshot initiative in Boston, where local coverage crossed the border into New Hampshire.\n\nAnd last week, Biden promoted manufacturing investments at a Volvo facility in Hagerstown, Maryland, just across the state line from Pennsylvania.\n\n“We’ve been very clear that the President is going to go out, the vice president is going to go out, the Cabinet Secretaries. And you’ll see Democrats in Congress – they’re going to talk about the success that we have seen in this administration the last 19 months,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week.\n\n“I don’t have any specific locations to share in the next four weeks,” she went on. “But, of course, the President loves being out there. And you will see – you’ll continue to see the President traveling.”\n\nIn addition to travel, the White House is making plans for the President to conduct more television interviews in the coming weeks, hoping to amplify his achievements. He is expected to do more interviews in the two months leading up to the midterm elections than during his entire time in office, aides said.\n\nAs he arrived in California on Wednesday night, Biden extended a long hug to Rep. Karen Bass, the Democratic nominee for Los Angeles mayor, who was once on his short list to be his running mate. And she hugged him back, a sign that being in Biden’s embrace is seen as good politics in her race.\n\nThe President will close out his Western swing with a visit to Oregon, which Biden carried by 17 percentage points just two years ago. But now, Democrats are deeply concerned about a remarkably competitive three-way contest for governor, along with two congressional seats that are in danger of slipping into Republican hands.\n\nHe is set to appear with Tina Kotek, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, and other local officials.\n\nWith a voter registration deadline looming October 18, the President’s stops in Portland are designed to excite Democrats and motivate independents as he lays out the stakes of potential Republican control of Congress and governor, which can help determine implementation of key parts of his agenda.\n\nWith only 25 days remaining until the November 8 election, aides said they are already planning for a low-key election night at the White House. The outcome will not only help set the course for the final two years of his first term, advisers said, but also help inform his thinking about the biggest political decision of all: whether he intends to seek reelection.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny Kevin Liptak", "Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/08/06/new-national-monument-could-stop-new-uranium-claims-grand-canyon/70522774007/", "title": "A proposed monument could halt new uranium claims around Grand ...", "text": "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK – Native American advocates for Grand Canyon land and water protections sang, danced and celebrated their spiritual connections to the canyon on Saturday ahead of a presidential visit this week that they hope will culminate in the designation of a 1.1 million-acre national monument beyond the park’s boundaries.\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to tour the Southwest, including Arizona, this week. Hopes are high among tribal and environmental advocates that the president will use this occasion to create the proposed Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument on federal lands north and south of the Grand Canyon. Others, especially local officials in northwest Arizona, oppose the prospect.\n\nThe advocates’ ultimate hope is that the monument, for which the government is expected to partner with tribes on management, will make permanent a 20-year moratorium on new uranium mining claims that the Obama administration imposed in 2012.\n\n“We have to do something,” Havasupai Tribal Councilwoman Dianna Sue White Dove Uqualla told The Arizona Republic after addressing a crowd of about 80 at the “Native Voices of the Canyon” event on Grand Canyon’s South Rim. “This land is a sacred place. Every place that you set foot, there’s a powerful connection to our elders and their spirits.”\n\nHer tribe, known as the People of the Blue Green Water, is among several whose origin stories center on the canyon and the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. They point to a legacy of poison and death left behind by open-pit uranium mines on Navajo lands that fueled the Cold War and fear new mines would contaminate aquifers whose waters emerge as springs in the Grand Canyon.\n\nUqualla said she fears for the rabbits that tribal members may eat and for the birds that come into contact with contamination, noting that a uranium mine operator in 2017 sought to evaporate water that infiltrated a mineshaft by spraying it in the air.\n\n“It is not going to kill us like a gun,” she said. “It will keep haunting us from generation to generation, and in the end, we will not be human.”\n\nThe tribes and environmental groups have pressed for a new monument to cover Kaibab National Forest lands south of the Grand Canyon, plus lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on the north side, east and west of the Kaibab forest lands there. Excitement has built in recent days, especially after the Washington Post reported on Friday that sources familiar with Biden’s thinking said he’s leaning toward using his Antiquities Act power to designate the monument. The White House did not respond to questions from The Republic, but some Arizona officials also suggested a designation may be imminent.\n\nHere's what to know:Proposed Grand Canyon monument could turn 1.1 million acres into protected land\n\n“We anticipate that the president and the administration will designate the Grand Canyon as a national monument, and do so in accordance with the legislation that I introduced,” U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., told The Republic on Wednesday. “I hope to hear good news on this as soon as next week.”\n\nThe legislation, also supported by Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., envisions tribal participation in the monument’s management. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., has backed one form or another of the monument for years. The land’s cultural significance to tribes is a major rationale for monument status.\n\nThe Mohave County government of northwest Arizona, backed by U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., opposes the monument. Much of the proposed protections would be in Coconino County, which has long supported the uranium moratorium. But Mohave County Supervisor Travis Lingenfelter said 445,000 acres of it would be in his district west of the North Rim and the Kaibab Plateau. There, he said, it could hinder economic development options for Colorado City, a fundamentalist religious community that has long been isolated — but has been working to engage with the rest of the county and state.\n\nMohave County supports protections for tribal sacred sites, he said, but not across a broad landscape that is supposed to be managed for the benefit of all Americans. “You can’t tell me that 445,000 acres of rangeland is culturally sensitive,” he said.\n\nLingenfelter was angered by the administration’s failure to conduct a public hearing in his county. Republican state lawmakers will hold their own hearing at 5 p.m. on Monday at the county offices in Kingman. At this point, though, Lingenfelter said it may be up to voters to hold accountable Arizona officials who go along with the president.\n\n“We believe that there’s a strong possibility, because of the way the BLM has been ignoring our requests and our calls — and the fact that we’ve been omitted from their public policy discussions — that they’re going to move on this monument.”\n\nOne uranium mine operating but not currently producing ore on the would-be monument’s southern section would be grandfathered in, allowing it to proceed with plans to dig and truck uranium to a mill in southeastern Utah. Hundreds of other existing claims theoretically could move forward as well but would require evaluations to determine if they’re economically viable and valid under federal law. No new claims have been staked during the moratorium, and none could be staked under a monument.\n\nUranium mining:Senate approves expanding compensation for Navajo Nation uranium miners, downwinders\n\nA spokesman for Energy Fuels, the company that operates the Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as Canyon Mine — the same one Uqualla feared had contaminated wildlife — said there’s no need for a monument to protect Grand Canyon waters.\n\n“There is zero scientific evidence that uranium mining on the lands covered by the proposed national monument has ever had any adverse effects on human health, groundwater, the Grand Canyon, or the environment,” spokesman Curtis Moore said in an emailed response to questions. “So, we believe a monument is unnecessary.”\n\nIt’s understandable that tribes including Navajo and Hopi, who have suffered contamination from past mining practices, should be skeptical of the industry, Moore said. But current mining methods are safer than the old pits left behind in the mid-20th century, he said.\n\n“Activist groups like the Sierra Club, Grand Canyon Trust, and others are happy to exploit this distrust to advance their anti-nuclear political agendas,” Moore said.\n\nGrand Canyon Trust responded that the tribes have led monument advocacy for years and with good reason.\n\n“The tribes have been working to stop uranium mining around Grand Canyon since long before environmental groups got involved,” said Amber Reimondo, the Trust’s director of energy programs. “The tribes themselves have experienced the negative impacts of uranium extraction.\n\nBoth Reimondo and Sierra Club Grand Canyon Program Manager Alicyn Gitlin challenged the company’s assertion that there’s no threat to waters that surface in the Grand Canyon. The lack of information about existing contamination is due to a dearth of sampling wells or federal funds for monitoring, they said. The fractured geology south of the Grand Canyon makes it hard to know where to look.\n\n“We really don’t know how water moves below the (Pinyon Plain) mine,” said Gitlin, who helped coordinate Saturday’s event. “We’re out here because the tribes are fearful for their water source.”\n\nHopi and Tewa musician-activist Ed Kabotie emceed the event, the first of several that his band, Tha 'Yoties, intends to stage around the country before an October engagement at Washington’s Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian. He shared the stage with a Hopi dance troupe and screenings of three films about Native connections to the canyon. The tour, called “Howlin’ for the Homelands,” is intended to support monument designation, but Kabotie said he’ll be happiest if it turns into a celebration after this week.\n\n“The establishment of a monument is a very important thing to our people,” he said. “It’s giving protection to the lands, giving protection to its medicines. As a co-managed monument, it’s honoring our heritage.”\n\nA new monument won’t instantly solve problems created by more than a century of displacement from the national park or the abuses of the land, he said, emphasizing that hundreds of uranium pits on Navajo land still await cleanup. He hopes for a new land-management vision that leads with the heart as well as the mind and leaves behind extractive industries that support economies elsewhere.\n\n“We’re howling for the indigenous people and lands of the Colorado Plateau,” Kabotie said. “The issues are all interconnected because the waters are all interconnected.”\n\nThe message resonated with tourists who assemble to watch and listen on Saturday. Rut Garcia, on a road trip with her family from North Lauderdale, Florida, said she appreciated exposing her 8- and 9-year-old children to the songs, dances and films.\n\n“We were able to see how the different tribes see the Grand Canyon and their feelings,” Garcia said. “It should be as protected as possible. If that’s what the monument means, I’m definitely supportive.”\n\nThe Republic's Debra Utacia Krol contributed reporting.\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

It would be located in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, a preserve centered on Camp Hale near Vail, where the legendary 10th Mountain Division trained for alpine warfare during World War II.\n\nIf Biden takes action, Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument would become the country's 130th national monument and the first since then-President Donald Trump declared Camp Nelson National Monument in Kentucky in 2018.\n\n'ABUSIVE FEDERAL OVERREACH':Utah sues Biden administration over restoration of national monuments on lands sacred to Native Americans\n\n\"The history of this area, including the role that it played in preparing the 10th Mountain Division for some of the most difficult moments of World War II, makes it the ideal candidate for a national monument designation,\" Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Gov. Jared Polis and Rep. Joe Neguse wrote in their letter to Biden.\n\nThe request comes as a massive conservation bill including Camp Hale has stalled in Congress. The CORE Act was introduced by Bennet, Hickenlooper and Neguse and Democrats contend the act would grow the state's outdoor recreation economy and protect public lands\n\nBut Colorado Republicans have called it a federal land grab that would restrict development of critical mineral and energy resources.\n\n\"I don't support the efforts of extremist environmentalists who are seeking to hijack this historic place to create a new land designation,\" Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe history of U.S. national monuments dates to the early 1900s, and protected areas are now located in 32 states, the District of Columbia and four American territories.\n\nDevils Tower, the almost otherworldly rock formation that juts nearly 900 feet skyward from the ground in Wyoming, was the first national monument. It was declared in September 1906 by then-President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nCalifornia and Arizona have the most national monuments, with 18, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe last national monument declared in Colorado was Browns Canyon in 2015, by then-President Barack Obama. It was one of 26 created by Obama during his two terms, the most of any president.\n\nThe Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in Hawaii, the world's largest marine conservation area, is the country's largest national monument, encompassing 583,000 square miles of ocean.\n\nAmong the smallest national monuments are the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality in Washington, D.C., the African Burial Ground in New York, and Pullman in Illinois.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/12/08/delaware-national-park-upgrade/20121981/", "title": "For Delaware, a national park upgrade", "text": "Jonathan Starkey\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe Senate could consider the legislation as early as Wednesday. U.S. House lawmakers passed the bill last week.\n\nThe park would include sites designated as Delaware%27s national monument just last year\n\nDelaware appears set to get a national park upgrade.\n\nBuried 1,200 pages into defense spending and ISIS war authorization legislation now in the U.S. Senate is a designation for the First State National Historical Park, which would recognize Delaware's colonial heritage and the state's role in the signing of the U.S. Constitution at a string of sites up and down the state.\n\nThe park would include sites designated as Delaware's national monument just last year, including the 1,100-acre Woodlawn property near Brandywine Creek State Park, the New Castle Court House complex in New Castle and The Green in Dover.\n\nNew sites could also be added to the park through preservation easements.\n\nThey include Holy Trinity (Old Swedes) Church in Wilmington, the John Dickinson Plantation near Dover, Ryves Holt House in Lewes and Fort Christina National Historic Landmark, a now-closed state-owned site in Wilmington protecting a spot called \"The Rocks,\" where the state's first permanent European settlers landed in 1638.\n\nOld Swedes Church traces its roots as a house of worship to the late 17th century. Early Swedish settlers completed the church in 1699, and much of the original structure stands today. It is known as the oldest American church still used for worship.\n\nThe Rev. Patricia Downing, who leads services at the church, says she's been involved in national park discussions in Delaware for about a decade. \"We think it's a wonderful opportunity for the congregation and for the state and for increasing awareness of our history,\" Downing said of a potential park designation.\n\nThe Senate could consider the legislation as early as Wednesday. U.S. House lawmakers passed the bill last week. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., has steadfastly sought a national park for Delaware.\n\nCarper on Monday suggested national monuments have second-class status in the parks system, saying that a historical park will bring more tourist dollars to the state and greater recognition of Delaware's history.\n\nA National Historical Park is a separate designation from a National Park, which is generally a large area with a variety of natural resources. Think of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming or Acadia National Park in coastal Maine.\n\nNational historical parks generally are not confined to a single property or building. One example is Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia, which includes Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center, among other sites. Both designations are considered units of the national park system and require Congressional approval.\n\nMonuments are created by presidential proclamations. It's unclear whether Delaware will get more federal funding with historical park designation.\n\nCarper said. \"Having a designated national park gives those of us in Delaware a chance to reach out across the world and invite people through the national park website to visit.\"\n\nThe sites – those already designed under the First State National Monument, as well as new proposed sites – celebrate the state's Swedish, Dutch and English colonial roots, and mark events leading up to the signing of the Constitution.\n\nDickinson – known as the Penman of the Revolution for his pro-independence writings – was a Delaware delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787.\n\nAlso, famously, 30 Delaware delegates met on Dec. 7, 1787, at the Golden Fleece tavern on The Green in Dover, a park site, to make Delaware the first state to ratify the Constitution.\n\nIn Lewes, the Ryves Holt House, built in 1665 by Dutch settlers, is known as the oldest house in Delaware. Ann Hilaman, president of the Lewes Historical Society, which owns the building, said they've had no formal discussions with the Park Service yet about an easement to be included in a national park.\n\n\"Naturally we're interested, we think it would be a great honor,\" said Hilaman, \"We really have not been contacted officially to negotiate who's going to do what and how it's going to be done.\"\n\nAdditional sites would be added to the park through preservation easements, not purchases by the park service, according to Carper's office.\n\nBlaine Phillips, mid-Atlantic director for the Conservation Fund, which was critical to designation of the monument, said designating a national park was the next step for Delaware.\n\nThe Conservation Fund, with a $20 million gift from the Mt. Cuba Center, purchased the Woodlawn property and gifted the site to the National Park Service.\n\n\"It was a $20 million gift that created the energy and the excitement to really jump-start the whole process. In my opinion, that's the momentum we're still riding,\" Phillips said.\n\nOnce the park is designated, \"work really begins,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"You have to roll up your sleeves and help create it and implement how it will be run,\" he said. \"It's a new park. And people need to have patience as it takes shape.\"\n\nPresident Obama created the national monument in March 2013 by proclamation. Vice President Joe Biden visited the New Castle sites, including the Old Sheriff's House, the New Castle Court House Museum and the New Castle Green, that month to dedicate the monument.\n\nProgress has been steady, but slow since, admits Russ Smith, the park superintendent and the monument's only employee.

While Biden has expanded some existing national monuments since becoming president, Wednesday marks the first time the President has used the 1906 Antiquities Act to create a national monument since taking office.\n\nAt the camp in Vail, Colorado, Biden called national monuments “treasures and wonders that define the identity of us as a nation.”\n\n“They’re a birthright that we pass down from generation to generation. And they unite us – and that’s what today is all about. We’re doing it not just for today but for all the ages,” he said. “And it’s for the people of Colorado, but it’s also goes well beyond the people of Colorado. It’s for all the people across America and the world. It’s a permanent, permanent decision, an action that no future president can overturn.”\n\nBiden said the Colorado lands “tell a story of America,” acknowledging that tribal nations have, for thousands of years, “been stewards of this sacred land, hunting game, foraging for medicinal plants and maintaining a deep spiritual bond with the land itself.”\n\nMaking Camp Hale a national monument will protect the site from development. The designation, the official said, will also “support jobs and America’s outdoor recreation economy.”\n\nCamp Hale, which is located in part of the ancestral homelands of the Ute Tribes, served as a training site for the US Army’s 10th Mountain Division before their deployment to the Italian Alps in World War II. Soldiers trained in rugged terrain, learning how to ski, climb and snowshoe in the Rocky Mountains before traveling to fight in the war. Many soldiers returned to the area after the war to help develop the local ski industry.\n\nAdditionally, the President announced that the administration is tapping into funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to mitigate the impacts of drought in the Colorado River Basin. And the US Department of the Interior is announcing it is moving to pause new mineral leasing or oil and gas leasing in the newly protected area.\n\nColorado’s Thompson Divide hasn’t been available to oil and gas leasing for several years and there’s no current or planned future oil exploration in the area, the department said in a news release. Natural gas leases already established in the area would be unaffected by the move, but they make up less than 1% of Colorado’s overall federal oil and gas leases.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland will also move to block new mining leases in the nearly 225,000-acre area. That step will need to go through a public comment period before it is finalized.\n\nSpeaking about the leases, Biden said on Wednesday “that there’s no current or planned oil exploration production in the area. We’re just keeping things as they’ve been for a long time … while we study whether we can get this done.”\n\nColorado Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis joined the President at the event along with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory, and additional local and tribal leaders.\n\nOne year ago, Biden announced the expansion of three existing national monuments – Bears Ears, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine – in a move that restored protections that had been undone by then-President Donald Trump. At the time, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said his state’s national monuments were being used as a “political football.”\n\nSome Coloradans have opposed Biden’s executive moves to expand federal protections, saying it could prevent future energy exploration. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, whose district includes the Thompson Divide, and other GOP members of Congress sent a letter to Biden opposing the President’s actions.\n\nColorado Democrats have pressed the White House to take the step in order to preserve an area of environmental and historical significance. Designating Camp Hale has been a key priority for Bennet, who faces a competitive race for reelection next month.\n\nAfter visiting Vail, Biden is slated to make stops in Los Angeles and Orange County in California, as well as Portland, Oregon.

It was a huge step and one that instantly put pressure on other big platforms to take action.\n\nWithin days, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitch had all either banned or indefinitely suspended Trump’s accounts. It marked a sweeping and unprecedented set of actions against a sitting world leader by platforms that had previously taken only limited actions against Trump as he repeatedly pushed the limits of their rules.\n\nLess than two years later, it appears Twitter (TWTR) could be poised to take a similar role in reversing the bans on Trump. Elon Musk on Tuesday confirmed what many in the tech, media and political spaces have been predicting for weeks: If his deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR) succeeds, he plans to restore Trump’s account.\n\nAlthough Trump has suggested he wouldn’t return to Twitter and will instead remain on his struggling social platform Truth Social, it’s not hard to imagine him changing his mind. Even before he was elected, Twitter was central to Trump’s image, providing him a platform to rally his base, criticize opponents, discuss policy plans and bypass the traditional media to explain his (sometimes untruthful) version of events to tens of millions of followers.\n\nMusk’s acquisition of Twitter is still far from set in stone. There have been questions about the Tesla CEO’s ability to finance the deal if his car company’s stock keeps falling, and Twitter’s share price has hovered well below Musk’s offer price of $54.20. On Friday, Musk said the deal was “temporarily on hold” pending details about the number of spam accounts on the platform. Still, Musk said Friday he remains “committed to acquisition.”\n\nIf Musk’s deal is completed, restoring Trump’s Twitter account could give the former President back his online megaphone ahead of another possible run for the White House. Even more than that, such a move would also likely open the door for other platforms to follow suit.\n\nBeyond the issue of Trump’s own accounts, reversing the ban could reignite a series of other thorny debates for Twitter and its rival platforms, including whether permanent bans should ever be used as a moderation tactic and if public figures or elected officials should be subject to different rules than other people.\n\nReversing the Trump bans\n\nEven before Musk made his stunning bid to buy Twitter, there was pushback in some quarters, including from those politically at odds with Trump, for banning a sitting world leader.\n\nThen-German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the time that Twitter’s ban on Trump was “problematic.” And on Tuesday, after Musk said he would restore Trump’s account, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero lauded the plan.\n\nIf Elon Musk fulfills his promise to return former President Donald Trump to Twitter, other major social media platforms could quickly follow suit. Stephan Schulz/dpa/Getty Images\n\n“You’d be hard-pressed to find a more steadfast opponent of Trump and his policies than the ACLU, but Elon Musk’s decision to re-platform President Trump is the right call,” Romero said in a statement. “Like it or not, President Trump is one of the most important political figures in this country, and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech.”\n\nTwitter founder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey said at the time of the ban that permanently suspending Trump was a difficult decision that came in response to “extraordinary” circumstances. The decision, which was quickly praised by a number of civil rights groups, was made “with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter” and after a clear warning to Trump, he said.\n\nIn the nearly 18 months since then, there has been widespread speculation that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms would eventually review their suspensions of Trump, especially if he decides to launch another bid for the White House in 2024. Unlike Twitter, Facebook and YouTube had implemented indefinite, but not necessarily permanent, suspensions.\n\nFacebook, in particular, is set to review its Trump ban early next year. After the company initially suspended Trump indefinitely, it faced pushback from its oversight board. The company decided it would maintain the suspension until at least January 7, 2023 — two years after Trump was initially removed. Nick Clegg, now the president of global affairs at Facebook-parent Meta, previously said that once the two years ended, Facebook would “look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded” to decide whether to restore Trump’s account.\n\nYouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has also said that its suspension on Trump’s account — which was initially implemented for one week and then extended to an indefinite ban — would eventually be lifted when any “risk of violence” had subsided.\n\nMusk’s deal to acquire Twitter is set to close by the end of this year, and if he acts quickly to reverse the Trump ban, it could give Meta and YouTube an opportunity to observe potential fallout from users and advertisers. Perhaps more importantly, it could also give the rival platforms political cover to make the same move.\n\nTech platforms tend to move in packs on everything from tricky policy decisions to new features. And this may be especially true when Twitter is leading the way.\n\nAlthough far from perfect, Twitter has, at least historically, been viewed as “more nuanced in their content moderation” and as “trying to do the right thing more often than other platforms,” said Kristin Martin, professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. “So I do think that whether they reverse the ban or start to allow certain content through, it will make a difference in the industry because they’re leaders.”\n\nMeta and YouTube declined to comment on this story.\n\nTwitter on Tuesday declined to comment on Musk’s plans to restore Trump’s account. Musk said on Twitter Thursday that, “even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter.”\n\nElon Musk has said that if his acquisition deal succeeds, he would return Trump to Twitter and do away with \"perma-bans\" on the platform. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMoving away from ‘perma-bans’\n\nRestoring Trump’s account could be the start of a broader shift for Twitter under Musk’s ownership — and for any other platforms that may choose to follow its example on content moderation.\n\nMany of the platforms have also banned far-right figures such as Milo Yiannopolous and Alex Jones for violating their policies against hateful or abusive behavior, and have removed other accounts — some prominent, some not — for repeatedly sharing conspiracy theories or misinformation.\n\nUnbanning Trump would likely raise questions about whether others should be brought back, and how the companies should handle accounts for whom smaller penalties don’t appear to discourage policy violations. Currently, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube all rely on some form of a strike policy for users who violate their rules various warnings and short-term suspensions before permanently removing repeat offenders.\n\nTrump had for years pushed the limits of social media platforms’ content moderation rules before the issue came to a head following January 6. In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Twitter suspended Trump for 12 hours before letting him post again and then ultimately banning him. (Facebook and Instagram, similarly, blocked Trump for 24 hours before indefinitely suspending him.)\n\nMusk, who has repeatedly said his goal is to bolster free speech on Twitter, has expressed a general opposition to the idea of permanent bans for all content except that which violates applicable laws. He said Tuesday that “permanent bans should be extremely rare” and reserved for “bots or spam, scam accounts where there’s just no legitimacy to the account at all.”\n\nBut high-profile suspensions make up only a small portion of the moderation decisions Twitter and other platforms must make. Much more often, they’re dealing with regular users who get suspended or banned for things like frequent harassment or spreading of misinformation, behavior that doesn’t necessarily break any laws but nonetheless makes for an unpleasant experience on the platform for other users.\n\nIf Musk does bring Trump back, online safety experts say it will be important for him to articulate a clear policy around why the decision was made and how the company will handle future violations, with or without a permanent ban as an option. Musk said Tuesday that the Trump ban was a mistake because it “alienated a large part of the country” and did not stop the former President from posting elsewhere online.\n\n“Trump used Twitter to foment a violent attack on Congress,” said Katie Paul, director of the online safety advocacy group Tech Transparency Project. “Others were prevented from using the platform to spread medical misinformation that cost countless lives, from organizing violent militias, inciting violence or persecuting victims of tragedies like Sandy Hook. If he succeeds in buying Twitter, Elon Musk cannot simply shirk the responsibility to ensure that his products don’t kill people.”\n\nMusk is well known for making grand promises, working out the details as he goes, if at all. The same appears to be happening with his thinking on moderation. While generally positioning himself as a free speech absolutist, Musk has so far offered only vague explanations of how he would handle violative content — whether it be from the President or an everyday user — without using permanent bans. “I think if there are tweets that are wrong and bad, those should be either deleted or made invisible, and a suspension, a temporary suspension is appropriate but not a permanent ban,” Musk said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/tech/silicon-valley-falls-back-to-earth/index.html", "title": "The year that brought high-flying Silicon Valley back down to earth ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn the first trading day of 2022, Apple hit a new milestone for the tech industry: the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded company to hit a $3 trillion market cap, with Microsoft and Google not far behind. As eye-popping as that valuation was, there were headlines speculating about how long it would be before Apple and its rivals topped $5 trillion.\n\nThe tech industry, already dominant, only seemed destined to grow even bigger at the start of this year. The spread of the Omicron variant suggested a continued pandemic-fueled demand for digital goods and services, which had buoyed many tech companies. Near 0% interest rates meant startups still had easy access to the funding that had fueled their high valuations and risky ventures.\n\nBut the year is ending on a much different note. A perfect storm of factors have forced a dizzying reality check for the once high-flying tech sector, making it one of the biggest losers of 2022.\n\nOver the course of the year, pandemic-era demand for many tech tools shifted; inflation soared; interest rates rose and fears of a looming recession weighed on consumer and advertiser spending, the latter of which makes up the core business of many household names in tech.\n\nThe result was a bloodbath unlike anything the tech industry has seen in the past decade. Tech stocks plunged, amid a broader market downturn. Tens of thousands of rank-and-file tech workers lost their livelihoods amid mass layoffs, both at tech giants like Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta as well as at smaller tech companies like Lyft, Peloton and Stripe. The crypto world all but imploded. And an entire industry known for burning cash on ambitious moonshots instead started shutting down projects and announcing cost-cutting efforts.\n\nEven the title of world’s richest man, which previously belonged to serial tech founder Elon Musk, ended up passing to Bernard Arnault, the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH, after Musk’s chaotic purchase of Twitter appeared to sour investors on his car company, Tesla.\n\nThe sharp shift in sentiment not only removed the air of invincibility for the industry; it also exposed some of its underlying myths. For years, Silicon Valley has held up its founders as visionaries who can see far into the future. But suddenly, many of its most prominent founders had to admit a harsh truth: they couldn’t even predict two years ahead.\n\nAs Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put it in a memo to staff last month announcing the company would cut 11,000 employees: “Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\nHe was far from the only one in the industry caught off guard.\n\nSilicon Valley’s rude awakening\n\nWhen the pandemic upended the broader economy in early 2020, tech firms only seemed to grow bigger and more powerful as people were forced to live out their lives online. Facebook (now Meta) could afford to nearly double its headcount and make multi-billion-dollar bets on a future version of the internet dubbed the metaverse. Amazon similarly went on a hiring spree and doubled its fulfilment center footprint to meet the surge in online shopping demand.\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote in his memo to staff last month. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments.”\n\nThen the market shifted.\n\nA person walking past the offices of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in King's Cross, London, on November 9. Meta has confirmed it plans to cut more than 11,000 jobs globally as part of a major restructuring of the tech giant. The cuts will reduce the size of the company's workforce by about 13 percent. Joshua Bratt/PA Images/Getty Images\n\n“People are terrible at predicting the future, and we always think that what’s happening now is going to happen forever,” Angela Lee, a professor at Columbia Business School who teaches venture capital, leadership, and strategy courses, told CNN. “But the reality is that the pandemic was a black swan event, and none of us knew what would happen going forward.”\n\nOne by one, the visionaries of Silicon Valley issued mea culpas. The founders of Stripe, Twitter and Facebook each took turns admitting they either grew their companies too quickly or were overly optimistic about pandemic-fueled growth in their sector.\n\n“We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown,” Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, wrote in a note to employees last month announcing 14% of the staff would be cut.\n\nIt wasn’t only a shift in consumers living their lives offline again that hurt the industry. The tech sector was particularly pummeled by the impacts of rising interest rates this year. Silicon Valley as a whole is arguably more sensitive to interest rate hikes than other industries, as many tech companies rely on easy access to funding to pursue their ambitious projects, typically before even turning a profit.\n\nIn a move to tame inflation, the Fed approved seven-straight rate hikes in 2022. Since the beginning of the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index shed more than 30% as of Dec. 21. By comparison, the Nasdaq soared more than 40% in 2020 and a further 20% in 2021. And the S&P 500’s Information Technology sector shed more than 28% this year through Dec. 21, considerably higher than the broader S&P 500’s fall of just 19% over that same period.\n\nApple’s market cap now hovers just above $2 trillion. Amazon’s stock has shed some 50% year to date. And shares for Meta have been hit even harder, losing nearly two thirds of their value in 2022. Once a trillion-dollar business last year, Meta has since seen its market value drop below companies like Home Depot.\n\n‘Return to sanity’\n\nThe shift in sentiment for tech has also hit the next generation of companies that aspire to be household names.\n\nGlobal venture funding hit a nine quarter low of $74.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, according to data from analytics firm CB Insights. This marked the largest quarterly percentage drop in a decade (34%), and a 58% decline from the investment peak reached in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nIn another sign of how this played out in the startup world: more than two new unicorns (startups valued at $1 billion or more) were born on average per business day in 2021, according separate data from CB Insights. That rate dropped to a pace of less than one new unicorn for every other business day in the third quarter of 2022, per CB Insights’ most recent analysis, the lowest since the first quarter of 2020.\n\nLee, who is also the founder of investing network 37 Angels, said when she met with tech founders this year, “I have said these words, which is, ‘I might have done this deal last year, but I am not going to do it now.’ And I’ve heard a lot of other people say that as well.”\n\nWhile the belt tightening might be painful for tech founders, Lee says she views it as a good thing for the tech industry overall. Many industry insiders have long said these sorts of corrections can help weed out some of the excess in the market and ensure more financially viable companies are the ones that survive.\n\n“Right now, there are like a lot of headlines that are just like, ‘The sky is falling, the end is near,’ and the way that I describe it is more of like a return to normalcy,” said Lee, noting that most charts tracking VC spending (from the number of mega-rounds to the number of IPOs) had a huge hump in 2020 and 2021 when interest rates were low, and now these charts are starting to look like how they did in 2019.\n\n“I would just call it like a ‘return to sanity,’ versus like, ‘the sky is falling,’” Lee said. “I do not think venture is cratering, or the tech industry is cratering as an industry.”\n\nBut for now, at least, there appears to be no end in sight to the pain for Silicon Valley and those who work in it.\n\nIn his own memo acknowledging job cuts at Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs at Amazon, reported to total some 10,000 roles, would continue into 2023.

These solutions will operate without the individual identifiers that allow developers to track user activity across various mobile apps and enable them to create ads targeted to a user’s behavior and interests. Google (GOOGL) said it is also exploring technologies that would reduce the potential for a user’s data to be collected without their knowledge.\n\nThe announcement — which comes as Google and other Big Tech companies face mounting regulatory scrutiny for privacy concerns and other issues — was light on specific details about how the new system would work. But it was enough to unnerve some investors in companies reliant on targeted digital advertising. Shares of Facebook-parent Meta (FB), Snap (SNAP), Twitter (TWTR) and Pinterest (PINS) all dipped in early trading Wednesday following the announcement.\n\nSome of those companies have already taken a financial hit in recent months after Apple implemented changes in its iOS 14.5 update last Spring with the aim of giving users greater privacy and control over their data. The change — which gives users the option to opt-out of having apps track their behavior — contributed to a more than $200 billion market value decline for Meta after it reported earnings results earlier this month. Meta said the app tracking change is expected to have a $10 billion impact on its bottom line this year.\n\nHowever, Google noted that it plans to work with developers to build the new system and said, without naming Apple, that it won’t take the same “blunt,” opt-out approach that the iPhone maker has taken, which could provide some reassurance to app companies and advertisers.\n\n“We believe that — without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path — such approaches can be ineffective and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses,” Anthony Chavez, vice president of product management for Android security and privacy, said in a blog post.\n\nChavez also noted that Google plans to continue supporting its existing tracking system for at least two years and will provide “substantial notice” to the industry about how the changes will work.\n\nAsked for comment about Google’s announcement and its potential impact on Meta’s business, a spokesperson for the social media company pointed to a tweet by Dennis Buchheim, the company’s advertising ecosystem vice president. “Encouraging to see this long-term, collaborative approach to privacy-protective personalized advertising from Google,” Buchheim said of Wednesday’s announcement.\n\nGoogle’s announcement comes as the company is also working to replace third-party cookies, which can be used to track users’ behavior across the web, with a more privacy-focused solution on its Chrome browser. That effort, which was initially slated to roll out this year, has hit some snags as Google attempts to balance the input of advertisers and privacy experts.\n\nIt also comes as European regulators crack down on the data privacy practices of Big Tech companies and as US regulators and lawmakers have increasingly raised concerns about dominant online giants preferencing their own products and services on their platforms. Google said it has committed not to prioritize its own ad products or sites with its privacy changes on the web, and will do the same on Android.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/homes/mortgage-rates-december-8/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates fall for the fourth week in a row | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nMortgage rates dipped again this week, dropping for the fourth week in a row.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.33% in the week ending December 8, down from 6.49% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate was 3.10%.\n\nMortgage rates have risen throughout most of 2022, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of hiking interest rates in order to tame soaring inflation. But mortgage rates have tumbled in the last couple of weeks, following reports that indicated inflation may have finally reached its peak.\n\nThe rate drops come amid concerns over lackluster economic growth, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\n“Over the last four weeks, mortgage rates have declined three quarters of a point, the largest decline since 2008,” said Khater. “While the decline in rates has been large, homebuyer sentiment remains low with no major positive reaction in purchase demand to these lower rates.”\n\nThe average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. But many buyers who put down less money upfront or have less-than-perfect credit will pay more than the average rate.\n\nEyes on next week’s economic events\n\nRates declined again this week as investors watched for more signs of slowing inflation, said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist.\n\n“Next week’s Consumer Price Index data will confirm whether these trends are pervasive across the variety of goods and services consumers buy,” she said.\n\nMarkets are also waiting to hear from the Fed, which is expected to announce another rate hike at its meeting next week. Analysts anticipate the rate increase could be a smaller half-point jump, rather than the three-quarter-point hikes that the central bank has rolled out four times in a row this year.\n\nMortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. When that rate goes up, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage typically goes up, too. When the treasury rate goes down, so do mortgage rates.\n\nThe Fed has signaled it intends to continue raising rates – even if it’s by smaller increments – until inflation shows clear signs of falling.\n\n“This means that mortgage rates may continue on the volatile path seen so far in 2022,” said Hale.\n\nAs a result of higher costs to finance a home and the volatility of rates, many would-be home buyers have left the market.\n\nMortgage applications slowed last week, even as the rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage decreased again, said Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average loan size for a purchase application last week was at its lowest level in nearly two years, another indication that home prices are cooling.\n\n“Despite the ongoing decline in mortgage rates that started in October, prospective homebuyers continue to delay decisions to purchase homes, even as home prices flatten or fall,” Broeksmit said.\n\nMore volatility ahead\n\nRates have seen outsized movement this year, mostly headed up, and the weekly swings in mortgage rates have been larger than historical averages, underscoring the overall volatility.\n\n“This has made setting a home purchase budget incredibly difficult for home shoppers who have watched their purchasing power swing up and down as rates fluctuate,” Hale said.\n\nThe recent drop below the 7% rates we saw a month ago have brought down the average monthly cost of purchasing a home by nearly $170, Hale said. But today’s buyer of a median-price home, making a 10% down payment, is looking at a monthly payment of $2,340 for principal and interest, an increase of about $900 a month from last year, according to Realtor.com.\n\n“As housing costs continues to be a major challenge for both buyers and renters alike, affordable midsize housing markets offer a potential refuge that workers with flexible arrangements may continue to seek out,” Hale said. Homebuyers sought affordability in cities like Hartford, Connecticut; El Paso, Texas; or Louisville, Kentucky, according to Realtor.com.\n\n“We expect the top housing markets of 2023 to remain relatively active, even as the number of home sales nationwide is expected to decline,” she said.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/economy/jerome-powell-speech-economy/index.html", "title": "Smaller rate hikes are likely coming in December, says Fed Chair ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nThe Federal Reserve could pull back on the pace of its aggressive rate hikes as soon as December, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday at an economic forum.\n\n“The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting,” he said in remarks at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, his last public appearance before the central bank enters a blackout period ahead of its December 13-14 policymaking meeting.\n\n“Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go,” Powell said, noting that the Fed has “not seen clear progress” on decades-high inflation plaguing the economy.\n\nInvestors have been closely watching for any indication that the Fed might slow or even pause its punishing schedule of rate hikes — the much-talked-about “pivot” that would release the brakes the central bank slammed on the economy.\n\nBut Fed officials have ramped up their rhetoric in recent weeks to disseminate the message that there’s much more work to do, and will forge ahead with rate increases — albeit smaller — until the current bout of decades-high inflation shows signs of abating.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard warned this week at a virtual event that the stock market is underpricing the risk of a continually aggressive Fed, and New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told the Economic Club of New York on Monday that inflation remains the “No. 1 economic concern across the globe,” citing underlying inflation in the service sector as “the most challenging” aspect of the battle.\n\nThe Fed has increased its benchmark lending rate six times this year in an attempt to discourage borrowing, cool the economy and bring down historically high inflation that peaked at 9.1% over the summer and has since slowed to 7.7%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index.\n\nYet despite that aggressive action — which would normally impact the labor market as companies pull back on their spending — the job landscape has so far remained resilient. After millions of people were thrown out of work at the start of the pandemic, the economy has since regained all lost jobs, adding hundreds of thousands more positions each month and maintaining an unemployment rate that is close to a half-century low.\n\nWhile that’s good news for workers, the tight labor market puts the Fed in a tricky position, since a shortage of staff means employees can essentially name their price, adding to inflationary pressures. The most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed Wednesday that there were almost 1.7 jobs available for every job seeker in October.\n\nThe decline in job openings is a positive development, Powell said Wednesday. While the relationship between job openings and unemployment is a “very fraught one,” he noted, he and other Fed officials believe there’s a possibility that the labor market could come back into balance via a decline in job openings as opposed to a spike in job losses.\n\n“We’ve seen that so far, but it’s way too early,” he said.\n\nA course of quick correction\n\nThe Fed is stuck tackling a supply-side inflation problem for which it has only blunt tools. Demand for goods surged in the United States last summer as consumers began to emerge from the darkest days of lockdowns and layoffs — but the global supply chain has taken longer to recover, leading to bottlenecks, a shortage of goods, and price surges.\n\nResisting calls to address runaway inflation and dismissing it as “transitory,” the Fed held on to its historically low interest rates, unwilling to risk short-circuiting any economic growth spurt. But as demand continued to surge, it became clear that inflation had quickly become the foremost concern for the central bank.\n\nThe Fed started on a course of quick correction in March, “front-loading” the economy with hefty interest rates, first hiking its benchmark lending rate by its usual quarter of a point, then by half a point and then rolling out four massive three-quarter-point hikes in a row.\n\nYet even this unprecedented action, unheard of in the modern central banking era, has yet to make a significant dent in US inflation. And the rate hikes could be doing more harm than good. Critics including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown have warned that the Fed’s “extreme” actions could “throw millions of Americans out of work.” Additionally, the housing market has already slowed dramatically, with mortgage rates recently topping 7% and home sales falling for nine straight months.\n\nSince rate hikes can take months, even years, to flow through the economy, the Fed now appears to be adopting a “lower and slower” model of smaller rate hikes over a longer period. Ideally, that approach will lead to the proverbial “soft landing,” reining in inflation while avoiding recession or significant layoffs.\n\n“I do continue to believe that there’s a path to a soft or softish landing,” Powell said Wednesday. “I think it’s still achievable.”\n\n“It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time,” he added. “History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace Lucy Bayly", "Alicia Wallace", "Lucy Bayly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Get ready for a spending slowdown this holiday ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

Retail sales surged by 1.3% in October. That’s the biggest monthly gain since February and better than the 1% economists had expected.\n\nBut a look under the hood tells a different story. Both Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) noted a softening in demand for discretionary items — the stuff you don’t need like electronics versus essentials like groceries. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, reported fewer customer transactions in the third quarter. The comments point to a slowdown ahead.\n\nWhat’s happening: Wednesday’s headline retail sales numbers, reported by the US Census Bureau, came in strong, but the momentum is unlikely to continue.\n\nStrong household finances at the beginning of the year helped stave off the impact of elevated inflation, but those conditions are changing. Credit card debt is growing, and savings are dwindling. The New York Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that consumer credit card balances grew by 15% year-over-year in the third quarter — the highest in more than 20 years.\n\nThe retail numbers also reveal a shift in spending. Those non-essential, discretionary sectors like apparel, home, and electronics are slowing.\n\nThe big boost to the headline sales number came from essential items like food and gas. Sales rose at grocery stores by 6.8%, but that increase was largely due to inflation, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. Food prices increased 10.9% in October from a year ago.\n\nTo mitigate price increases, shoppers are also increasingly buying store-brand items and finding cheaper places to shop, added Saunders.\n\nThese cracks in retail are starting to show just as the sector enters its most critical sales period: The holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation, a trade group for the retail industry, estimates that holiday sales will increase between 6% and 8% this year, slower growth than a year ago.\n\nA tale of two stores: Walmart and Target reported that their private-brand sales grew last quarter and that grocery sales outperformed those of discretionary items. But overall, their earnings show very different pictures.\n\nTarget’s profit plunged 52% in the third quarter, and the company lowered its outlook for the rest of the year. In a call on Wednesday, CEO Brian Cornell said that in recent weeks “sales and profit trends softened meaningfully, with guests’ shopping behavior increasingly impacted by inflation, rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.”\n\nWalmart, meanwhile, beat Wall Street estimates and reported that sales rose by nearly 9% last quarter. The company also raised its full-year outlook.\n\nSo what explains the discrepancy?\n\n“Everything is kind of muddy right now,” said Jim Baird, Plante Moran Financial Advisors CIO. But he said there’s a clear distinction in how retailers are handling the build up of inventory caused by global supply chain issues.\n\nAnalysts largely say that Walmart has done a good job at clearing through the backlog of merchandise stuck at ports, while Target has had more difficulty getting rid of excess, now out-of-season goods.\n\nWalmart has also benefited from new, higher-income shoppers looking to trade down to save some cash.\n\nThe bottom line: This holiday season will likely be a mixed bag with some winners and losers in the retail sector, said Saunders. But one thing that’s clear is that “there is definitely softening underway.”\n\nBritain goes back to austerity\n\nIt’s been less than two months since former British finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng revealed his plans for large tax cuts and increased spending amid historically high inflation. It didn’t go too well: Markets went berserk, there was a bond meltdown, and the country’s prime minister ultimately lost her job.\n\nThe new government is not looking for a repeat performance, reports my colleague Julia Horowitz. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will unveil a budget that will aim to restore confidence in the United Kingdom’s ability to manage its public finances on Thursday by doing just the opposite of his predecessor.\n\nMedia reports indicate that the government is looking to come up with between £50 billion ($59 billion) and £60 billion ($70 billion) through a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, many of which may not take effect until after the next election in 2024.\n\nBut regaining market confidence may be easier said than done.\n\nThe country is staring down the barrel of a grueling recession, and investors remain on edge as interest rates rise. That requires Hunt, who has acknowledged that Britain faces “extremely difficult” decisions, to pull off a delicate balancing act.\n\nNew cuts could make matters worse by shaving off some of the country’s GDP and putting excess pressure on already strained public services. Tax increases could also chip away at consumer confidence — already near a record low.\n\nStill, Hunt is steadfast in his plan. “We do have to do some tax rises, do some spending cuts, if we’re going to show we’re a country that pays our way,” he told Sky News on Sunday.\n\nMore layoffs for Big Tech\n\nAmazon (AMZN) confirmed on Wednesday that layoffs had begun at the company, two days after multiple outlets reported the e-commerce giant planned to cut around 10,000 employees.\n\n“After a deep set of reviews, we recently decided to consolidate some teams and programs. One of the consequences of these decisions is that some roles will no longer be required,” wrote Dave Limp, senior vice president of devices & services at Amazon in a publicly-shared memo. “We notified impacted employees yesterday, and will continue to work closely with each individual to provide support, including assisting in finding new roles.”\n\nHe did not specify how many employees have been cut.\n\nThe big picture: Amazon is adding to the growing trend of layoffs in Big Tech.\n\nFacebook-parent Meta (META) recently announced 11,000 job cuts, the largest in the company’s history. Twitter also announced widespread job cuts after Elon Musk bought the company for $44 billion. Lyft (LYFT) has laid off 13% of its workers. And Stripe, Zillow (Z) and GoFundMe have also announced layoffs this quarter.\n\nApple (AAPL), meanwhile, has announced a hiring freeze and Google (GOOG) has said it will slow its pace of hiring.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/ceo-economic-outlook/index.html", "title": "CEO economic outlook tumbles to two-year low | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSlower hiring.

That’s what America’s CEOs are bracing for as the economy heads into 2023 facing a series of obstacles.\n\nThe Business Roundtable said Monday its CEO Economic Outlook Index tumbled during the fourth quarter to the lowest level in more than two years.\n\nThe index, a composite of CEO plans for business investment, hiring and sales expectations, has declined every quarter this year, plunging from 124 a year ago to 73 now.\n\n“The results signal CEOs remain cautious amid persistent domestic and global economic headwinds, including high inflation and the Fed measures required to tame it,” the Business Roundtable said in a news release.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been rapidly raising interest rates in a bid to put the inflation fire out.

A scramble to get users to ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nAaron Hommell bought his 3G iPhone 5 in 2014 and kept it for more than seven years, holding onto it even after the screen cracked and a long list of faster models hit the market. Then a year ago, AT&T began sending him emails that the company would be shutting down its 3G network and moving its subscribers to its higher-speed 4G and 5G networks.\n\n“I kept putting off [upgrading] since it was not my primary phone,” said Hommell, who used the iPhone as a work device for his Gulfport, Mississippi, law firm. “Eventually, a letter came saying they would be sending me a phone in a few weeks. I just waited and boom, there it is on my doorstep.”\n\nHommell, who was sent a new iPhone XR from AT&T (T) in October, is among the small segment of 3G holdouts who’ve received a free 4G phone from AT&T (T), which owns CNN’s parent company, ahead of its 3G network shutting down later this month.\n\n“For nearly two years, we have been communicating with consumers via direct mail, emails and text messages and we will continue to do so as we help them navigate this transition,” AT&T told CNN Business in a statement. “This includes providing free replacement phones to a substantial majority of customers.” AT&T said the replacement devices tend to be 4G versions of smartphones that run on the same operating system the users had previously been using.\n\nThe 3G network launched in 2002 and became the driving force behind the early App Store boom around the end of that decade that followed the release of the first iPhone. Then the wireless companies moved on to 4G and more recently 5G networks. Now the three major carriers are moving to shutter 3G technology, with AT&T taking the step on February 22, T-Mobile (TMUS) doing so in the third quarter, and Verizon (VZ) by the end of the year. As the technology officially becomes obsolete, a scramble is underway to help consumers avoid a disruption.\n\nThe shift will impact people still using 3G Kindles, 3G flip phones, the iPhone 5 and older models, various Android phones and some wearable devices. It will also affect home alarm systems and medical devices such as fall detectors. Some in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems like OnStar will also need to be updated or replaced.\n\nGeneral Motors, for example, which owns OnStar, started pushing over-the-air updates in October to vehicles released as far back as 2015, including models from Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, that may be impacted by the transition. Some alarm companies are also urging customers to schedule appointments for technicians to fully replace their systems.\n\nEven with these efforts, there’s a chance some customers (and devices) get left behind.\n\n“There is always a risk of people losing service or devices being disconnected from the network,” said Dimitris Mavrakis, senior director at market research firm ABI Research. “Mobile operators make significant attempts to minimize this, but there will always be devices that are left out.”\n\nWho’s at risk of losing service?\n\nOnly a small portion of wireless customers are still using 3G networks. Verizon said in a blog post that 99% of its customers have already upgraded to 4G LTE or 5G, and AT&T said less than 1% of its mobile data traffic runs on 3G networks. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment about its 3G userbase.\n\nAccording to Roger Entner, analyst and founder of Recon Analytics, these combined estimates equate to about 3 million people. He suspects the holdouts “almost never use [their 3G device] and hence don’t get caught by the alerts when they make or receive a call.”\n\nThose using a 3G phone have likely gotten texts, emails and physical mail from their wireless carriers over the past year urging them to upgrade. (If you’re not sure which network your phone is on, open Settings, tap Network and Internet, and then select Mobile Network on Android devices. On iOS, choose Settings, Cellular and then pick Cellular Data Options.)\n\nDetermining whether other household devices run on 3G may be a bit more complicated, however.\n\n“These connected devices are at a greater risk of being disconnected from the network but individual vendors do spend time to alert their users that their 3G systems will be decommissioned shortly,” Mavrakis said.\n\nSome companies, such as My Alarm Center, a home security systems business, are warning customers certain systems will need to be replaced by a technician to avoid potential disruptions. “Even if your alarm appears to function, it will no longer communicate with our central service station to notify us that emergency services are needed,” the company states on its website.\n\nFor mobile devices, however, there are some workarounds for people who don’t want to get rid of their 3G devices all together. In theory, it will be possible to access a web browser via Wi-Fi or make calls over wireless on a 3G phone if the user has an app enabling voice-over-internet protocol, such as Facebook Messenger. Similarly, people with a 3G e-reader will still be able to download new books on the device via Wi-Fi.\n\nMobile carriers are mostly not upcharging their customers to switch from 3G to 4G plans, likely to keep them from wandering off their data plans.\n\nAT&T said “an extremely small segment” might have to change to a plan that results in a change in their rate. Sprint said anyone with a 3G device will be able to pay the same or less for 4G or 5G service from T-Mobile and can upgrade to a new device, including some 5G phones, at no cost. Verizon said customers are “strongly encouraged” to upgrade now and that it is “offering aggressive promotions.” (Verizon hasn’t said if it will be mailing users replacement devices as part of a last-ditch effort before its shutoff date.)\n\nWill 4G be the next to go?\n\nThis is not the first time a network has been phased out nor will it be the last. The effort to shut down 3G is primarily to re-use the spectrum for 4G and 5G, which are newer standards, better technologies and more efficient than 3G. The same thing happened with 2G, which AT&T and Verizon shut down around the end of 2017; T-Mobile plans to shut its 2G network in December.\n\nLast month, AT&T and Verizon turned on C-band 5G networks, an important set of higher radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet. The change will allow users to, for example, stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second, about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE.\n\nAs 5G gains traction, and possibly 6G after that, 4G may be the next to get phased out.\n\nPhones have arguably maxed out what’s possible with 4G at this point. The technology paved the way for on-demand apps such as Uber (UBER), mobile video consumption on Netflix (NFLX) and FaceTime, real-time rerouting via Google Maps, and social sharing on Instagram and Snapchat. But 5G could offer a doorway into what’s next — such as powering autonomous vehicles or enabling robotic surgeries — thanks to the ability to handle an uptick in traffic and bandwidth with no lag times.\n\nAs for whether another new smartphone might one day magically appear on his doorstep to replace the 4G iPhone he just received, Hommell said, “We can all hope for that.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/tech/tech-earnings-september-quarter-low-expectations/index.html", "title": "Tech earnings are coming and they probably won't be pretty | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter months of layoffs, hiring freezes and other cost-cutting measures, big tech companies are set to provide the most detailed look yet at just how bad things have gotten for their businesses amid fears of a looming recession.\n\nSnapchat’s parent company, which tanked much of the tech sector in May with a warning about a worsening economy, is set to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB)-parent Meta, Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) will each report earnings results the following week.\n\n“People probably should be bracing themselves for these results,” said Scott Kessler, technology global sector lead at research firm Third Bridge Group.\n\nFor years, the giants of Silicon Valley seemed almost immune to swings in the global economy. Even amid a pandemic, a trade war and other geopolitical uncertainty, the biggest names in tech only seemed to grow bigger and richer. But like other sectors in recent months, they have faced a variety of new challenges.\n\nRampant inflation is eating away at consumers’ paychecks and reducing their ability to spend freely on tech products and services. Increased costs and recession fears have cut down on demand for online advertising and enterprise tech services. And other macroeconomic issues such as continued supply chain snarls and higher interest rates are stunting growth, analysts say.\n\nTo make matters worse, tech companies must also confront the growing strength of the US dollar, which is currently trading at its highest level in two decades. That can mean sales made overseas are not worth as much, according to Angelo Zino, senior industry analyst at CFRA Research. A stronger US dollar may also make hardware products from companies like Apple less affordable for foreign consumers, which, as Zino points out, is problematic given “most of these companies are generating more than half their revenue outside the United States.”\n\nIn a striking shift, most of the big tech companies are now expected to report slowing profit and revenue growth, or even year-over-year declines, for the three months ending in September, according to analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), which is projected to be in the best shape, is expected to post essentially flat sales from the year prior. Meta’s revenue is projected to fall 5% year-over-year, marking the company’s second consecutive quarterly revenue decline. Net income at Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Google and Snap is also expected to be down from the year prior.\n\nThese dour projections come after many tech businesses were already showing signs of weakness in the prior quarter. Meta in July posted its first year-over-year quarterly revenue decline since going public in 2012 in large part due to decreased demand in the online advertising market that fuels its core business. Twitter (TWTR), Snap, Google, Apple and Microsoft all also reported that shrinking ad budgets had taken some toll on their June quarter earnings.\n\n“We compare investor negative sentiment on tech today to what we have seen only 2 other times in our decades of covering tech stocks: 2008 and 2001,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors this week, referring to two prior recessionary periods.\n\nMany of the issues currently weighing on tech companies are unlikely to let up anytime soon, which is why industry watchers will be paying close attention to the guidance these companies offer for the rest of 2022.\n\n“More than anything, people really want a good understanding about what to expect” from the final three months of this year, which has “historically been the most important quarter for these companies,” Kessler said. Investors will likely want to know, for example, whether the online ad market has begun to stabilize ahead of the crucial holiday season.\n\nNegative results or future outlook could lead to increased pressure on tech firms to focus on their core businesses and cut back on big bets that aren’t expected to quickly product returns. Some of that is already underway.\n\nIn recent weeks, Google announced it would shut down its gaming service Stadia, Amazon said it would stop testing a home delivery robot and Meta shut down its newsletter product, Bulletin.\n\nMeta may be in a uniquely difficult position. Last October, Facebook rebranded as Meta and ramped up investments to build a future version of the internet called the metaverse, which isn’t expected to be fully realized for years, if ever. But the Wall Street Journal reported last month the company was quietly reducing staff — and some analysts expect more cuts to come.\n\n“I do think you’ll see them announce cost cuts. I think they’ll reduce the workforce,” Zino said. “Meta is really boxed in a corner here. Their core business is in an environment where they’re not going to see much growth at all … and they don’t have any major revenue center outside of advertising.”\n\nWhat a difference a year makes.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/economy/federal-reserve-jackson-hole-2022-walkup-powell/index.html", "title": "What Wall Street hopes to hear from the Federal Reserve at Jackson ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nInflation talk is expected to dominate the Federal Reserve’s annual summer gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week.\n\nWall Street will be closely watching the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium — which will return to an in-person format after two years of being held virtually — searching for clues about where the Fed might head next in its attempts to tame rising prices.\n\n“It’s interesting how this August speech of the Fed chair at Jackson Hole has become such an important platform for the Fed to influence market expectations about policy. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,” said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe title of this year’s symposium, which kicks off on Thursday and runs through Saturday, is “Reassessing Constraints on the Economy and Policy.” Inflation is certain to be the hottest, although not the only topic discussed, and nearly every word published or spoken will be painstakingly parsed by traders and analysts for any hint of what it might indicate about the central bank’s policy trajectory.\n\nOf particular interest to market participants is Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s keynote speech on Friday morning.\n\n“[These speeches are] much meatier than the usual policy speech, so there’s much more to chew on,” said Kenneth Kuttner, an economics professor at Williams College.\n\nWall Street wants reassurance — but not too much\n\nWhether the market will get the feel-good story it wants, or remarks that throw cold water on those hopes, is an open — and hotly debated — question.\n\n“What they are hoping to hear from Jay Powell is that the Fed will move to reduce inflation, but will be sufficiently confident that it can reverse course early next year. I don’t think they’re going to hear that,” said Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor and deputy dean for executive programs and economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference on interest rates, the economy and monetary policy in June after the Fed announced the most aggressive interest rate increase in nearly 30 years. Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images\n\nInstead, he said the Federal Reserve hopes that by raising interest rates quickly it won’t have to raise them too high. “If that’s the case, they may be able to avoid a significant slowdown, but that’s by no means guaranteed,” he said.\n\nThe Fed has to thread the needle on policy moves, as well as on how it communicates those intentions. Powell could trigger Wall Street angst if he sounds too hawkish — or not hawkish enough.\n\n“I think what Powell is going to try and do is continue his narrative on fighting inflation while trying to dissuade the market from the notion that the Fed has made a dovish pivot,” said David Norris, partner and head of US credit at TwentyFour Asset Management. “I don’t think he’s going to surprise the markets by his statements,” he said.\n\n“The Fed’s calls to date have been relatively easy,” Wessel said, adding that there isn’t much guesswork involved when interest rates are hovering near zero percent, unemployment is touching five-decade lows and inflation is soaring.\n\nBut going forward, weighing the risk-reward trade-offs will become more challenging — and the stakes will become higher — as those initial rate hikes begin to produce economy-cooling results.\n\n“At some point, they’re going to have to decide, ‘Have we done enough?’ and they’re always close calls, and at that point, they will have to decide which risk is most serious — the risk of doing too much and causing a recession or the risk of doing too little and getting inflation embedded in the economy,” Wessel said. “My gut is they’re going to err on the side of doing too much.”\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has said the Fed needs to project an aggressive stance on inflation, and is calling for Powell to use his Jackson Hole speech to chart a path of “restrictive” monetary policy. “My worst fear would be that the Fed will continue to be suggesting that it can have it all in terms of low inflation, low unemployment and a healthy economy,” he said on Bloomberg TV over the weekend.\n\nPowell’s words could come back to haunt him\n\nAt the Jackson Hole economic summit last year, Powell made the case that inflation wouldn’t linger — a prediction that has not aged well and that economists worried would tarnish the central bank’s credibility.\n\nAt the time, he asserted that inflation was confined to a discrete set of goods and services and blamed rising prices on the widespread shift in spending as Americans bought all sorts of goods rather than spending money on services. “From long experience we expect the inflation effects of these increases to be transitory,” he said at the time.\n\nThe same day Powell spoke at last year’s symposium, the Commerce Department announced that the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the index of personal consumption expenditures, had risen by 4.2% over the year, the steepest increase since January 1991.\n\n“He also spoke at length about inflation and made a lengthy argument that turned out to be… not so good in hindsight,” Kuttner said. “The mistakes are always glaring in hindsight.”\n\n“Maybe this time it’s going to be making a call on the likelihood of a recession,” he said. “I think he almost has to say there won’t be [one]. There’s a good chance he’s going to be wrong on that.”\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell and New York Federal Reserve President John Williams take a walk before the last in-person Jackson Hole economic summit, which was held in 2019.

Although the current unemployment rate is an ultra-low 3.5%, it would be a mistake to take that for granted, he said, predicting that job losses are likely to rise.\n\n“I think they may be too sanguine about what may happen with the unemployment rate. Even if we don’t have a full-blown recession, I just don’t see how we can have the unemployment rate stay at only around 4% and inflation to come down — and get down to 2% quickly — with an unemployment rate peaking only barely above its long run average,” he said.\n\nIt’s possible, Kroszner added, that Powell will adopt the same kind of overly-optimistic outlook that kept the Fed from rolling back its pandemic-era support for the economy even as price increases were picking up.\n\nSupply issues, fiscal policy also likely to be addressed\n\nFed watchers pointed out that the central bank’s usual tools for combating high prices are limited in the current economy because both demand and supply imbalances are contributing to spiraling prices.\n\n“I think you’ll hear broadly about supply chain disruptions,” Kroszner said, but he expressed skepticism that Fed policymakers fully appreciate the extent to which those disruptions have affected the economy. “We have to take anything positive there with a grain of salt,” he said.\n\nKroszner said government spending could also be addressed. “My guess is there will be some people thinking about fiscal issues — that’s not directly in the Fed’s control, but the Fed takes [it] into account,” he said.\n\nEven with the trillions of dollars in pandemic-related spending added to the US debt load, paying for it has not weighed heavily on the economy to date, he pointed out — but that dynamic could be at an inflection point, with potentially serious consequences for economic growth in the future.\n\n“Servicing that debt is… going to be a much larger burden, so there might not be as much fiscal space available to respond if there is a significant economic downturn,” he warned.", "authors": ["Martha C.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nDecember’s full moon, also known as the “cold moon,” will shine bright in the night sky this Wednesday, peaking at 11:08 p.m. ET.\n\nJupiter, Saturn and Mars will also be visible in the night sky Wednesday, with an extraordinarily rare phenomenon, known as a lunar occultation of Mars, set to happen around the moon’s peak fullness, according to EarthSky.\n\nAt this point, the red planet will disappear behind the moon for a short period of time. This highly unusual event will be visible in parts of the Americas, Europe and Northern Africa.\n\nDecember 7 also marks the 50th anniversary of NASA’s Apollo 17 mission launch — the last time humans set foot on the moon. This year’s cold moon, then, offers viewers both the chance to enjoy a lunar spectacle and reflect on the monumental space exploration humanity has achieved.\n\n“When you look up at the moon, you should appreciate that it’s not only beautiful … but that it’s a very scientifically important object,” said Dr. Noah Petro, chief of NASA’s planetary geology, geophysics and geochemistry lab.\n\n“There is no other planet in our solar system that has a moon quite like ours. It is unique in many, many ways, and we, as a society, the whole of humanity, are very fortunate to have it literally in our backyard.”\n\nThe Mohawk people deemed the December full moon “tsothohrha,” or time of cold — in reference to the frigid weather it would usually accompany, according to the Western Washington Planetarium site. Like many other Native American tribes, the Mohawks kept track of the months by giving a name to each full moon.\n\nThis full moon has also been known as the “moon before Yule” in Europe, to mark the Yuletide festival, and as the “long night moon” by the Mohicans, due to its proximity to the winter solstice, the longest night of the year, which falls on December 21 this year, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nMoon observing\n\nThe full moon will make its way across the sky starting at sunset. And with the sun going down earlier in the Northern Hemisphere, there is a longer time period for those looking to catch sight of the lunar event. Anywhere with a clear view of the sky will suffice, Petro said, though for best viewing, he recommends finding an area free from tall buildings and trees.\n\nThe last full moon of the year rises behind Galata tower in Istanbul on Wednesday. (AP Photo/Emrah Gurel) Emrah Gurel/AP\n\n“The day before and a day after, the moon will still appear full to the naked eye,” Petro said. “So, if it’s cloudy on the seventh, you can try again on the eighth.”\n\nThe forecast for Wednesday evening will be partly cloudy skies in New York City, mostly clear skies in Los Angeles and mostly cloudy skies in Chicago, according to Allison Chinchar, CNN meteorologist.\n\nThose in the Southern Hemisphere will get the same view of the full moon during nighttime hours, although the orientation will be flipped, as always.\n\nExploring the moon\n\nThe Apollo 17 spaceflight launched on December 7, 1972. It was the final mission of NASA’s Apollo program and brought the number of humans who have walked on the moon to a grand total of 12. The three crew members, Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans and Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, returned to Earth on December 19 after a 12-day mission.\n\nThe 363-foot-tall Saturn V rocket is shown at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, at 12:33 a.m. ET, December 7, 1972. Apollo 17 was the final lunar landing mission in NASA's Apollo program. NASA\n\nToday, NASA has successfully kicked off its Artemis program, which aims to establish the first lunar outpost and further explore the moon. The Artemis I mission launched November 16, sending the uncrewed Orion spacecraft on a 25.5-day journey to circumnavigate the moon, with an expected return date of December 11, four days after the full moon.\n\nThe space agency hopes further lunar discoveries will in turn lead to the first human setting foot on Mars.\n\n“(The moon) is a very important extension of our own planet that we’ve had the fortune of having visited with humans … and that we’re preparing to return to with both robotic and crewed explorers,” Petro said.\n\n“I would hope that people take a moment to pause and look up and think, ‘wow, how fortunate we are as a planet to have this moon with us.’”\n\nLast celestial events of the year\n\nThe cold moon marks this year’s last full moon event, but December’s skies will also feature two more meteor showers. Sky gazers won’t want to miss the vibrant Geminids, which peak on December 14 — and the Ursids swiftly follow and are set to peak on December 22, according to EarthSky’s 2022 meteor shower guide.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicioli"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/14/lyrids-meteor-shower-2023-how-to-watch/11664039002/", "title": "Lyrids meteor shower peak: How to watch, when to look this weekend", "text": "Sky gazers are in for a special treat this weekeend as the beloved Lyrids meteor shower will reach its peak.\n\nThe Lyrids meteor shower has been observed for 2,700 years, making it one of the oldest-known meteor showers on record. The first reported Lyrids sighting dates back to 67 BC in China, according to NASA.\n\nThe Lyrids are pieces of debris from the Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher. In April of each year, Earth runs into the stream of debris from the comet, causing the meteor shower.\n\nIn 2023, the Lyrids meteor shower, which is active from April 15 through April 29, is expected to peak this weekend, EarthSky says.\n\nThe American Meteor Society describes the Lyrids meteor shower as a \"medium strength shower.\" While the Lyrids bring fast and bright meteors, they're not as plentiful as showers like the August Perseids, NASA notes.\n\n\"Lyrids don’t tend to leave long, glowing dust trains behind them as they streak through the Earth's atmosphere, but they can produce the occasional bright flash called a fireball,\" NASA adds.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nThe Lyrids meteor shower: A visual guide on where, when and how to view\n\nBest stargazing events of 2023:How to see green comet, meteor showers and an eclipse this year\n\nWhen is the Lyrids meteor shower and its 2023 peak?\n\nThe Lyrids, which will be active through April 29, will peak April 22 and April 23, NASA says.\n\nIn the U.S., the best time to view the Lyrids' 2023 peak will be around 9 p.m. ET on April 22, according to predictions from the American Meteor Society.\n\nIn a handful of extraordinary years, the Lyrids have surprised stargazers with up to 100 meteors an hour, NASA notes. But, for most years, viewers can typically expect 10 to 20 meteors during the peak.\n\n\"The normal Lyrid display, seen under moonless conditions, usually offers a peak of around 10 meteors per hour in addition to the normal random meteor rate of about 5 per hour,\" the American Meteor Society writes.\n\nWhere to see the Lyrids meteor shower\n\nWhile people can see the Lyrids around the globe, this meteor shower is most easily viewed in the Northern Hemisphere during dark hours.\n\nThe Lyrids' radiant point, or the place in the sky where meteors appear to emerge from, is \"far to the north on the sky’s dome,\" EarthSky notes.

However, the Lyrids can appear anywhere in the sky.\n\n\"It is actually better to view the Lyrids away from their radiant: They will appear longer and more spectacular from this perspective,\" NASA adds.\n\nHow to watch the Lyrids meteor shower\n\nViewing conditions for meteor showers depend on a variety of factors – including weather, light pollution, the moon's brightness and more.\n\nTo best view a meteor shower like the Lyrids, go outside during dark hours of the night – between moonset and before dawn. You'll want to find a spot far away from city and street lights.\n\nFor the Lyrids, NASA recommends viewers \"lie flat on your back with your feet facing east.\" Try to take in as much as the night sky as possible, and be patient.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

People in the country have an advantage, but there are places close to most towns you can go to find dark skies.\n\nGood spots to watch include safe pull-offs along highways and back country roads, parks that allow visitors after dusk and vista points.\n\nFor advice on where to stargaze in your area, search for local astronomy clubs online and check NASA's web page on how to find stargazing spots.\n\nIf you're planning to view a meteor shower, keep in mind that although each radiates from a particular direction, meteors can hit the atmosphere anywhere; so look for them all over the night sky. The number of meteors visible per hour are based on darkest skies.\n\nMeteor showers of 2023:A visual guide on where and when to view the year's 11 sky shows\n\nHere are best stargazing events to see in 2023, most with the naked eye, according to NASA, the Farmer's Almanac, SeaSky.org and the American Meteor Society:\n\nRare green comet\n\nJanuary is your chance to view a once in a 50,000-year event: A green comet called C/2022 E3 (ZTF). First seen in March 2022, it may be visible to the naked eye, according to NASA, but comets are \"tricky\" to predict.\n\nC/2022 E3 ZTF is closest to Earth on Feb. 2, but is most visible to the Northern Hemisphere in January. If you have a telescope or powerful binoculars, look for it in the north morning sky near Polaris/North Star, NASA said.\n\nGraphics:A rare green comet is headed our way. Here's how to see it without a telescope.\n\nBest views of Mercury\n\nOn Jan. 30, the planet orbiting closest to the sun affords Earthlings a good opportunity to view it with the naked eye.\n\nLook low in the southeast sky in the pre-sunrise hours. Other good dates to view Mercury are April 11, May 29, Aug. 10, Sept. 22 and Dec. 24.\n\nLyrids Meteor Shower\n\nThis small annual shower is best seen in the southern sky between midnight and dawn. It peaks from April 21 to 22.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 10.\n\nEta Aquarids Meteor Shower\n\nPeak viewing for this shower – caused by dust particles left by Halley’s Comet – is the morning of May 4 to 5. It rises/originates in the southeastern sky. Best times to watch are between midnight and dawn.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 10.\n\nBest view of Venus\n\nThe brightest, hottest planet in our solar system is most visible in the western sky on June 4. Best times to watch are the evening hours after sunset.\n\nAlmost as big as Earth, “Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect,” according to NASA. Temperatures reach around 864 degrees Fahrenheit. The clouds that coat the planet reflect the sun’s light, making Venus the third brightest object seen from Earth after the sun and moon.\n\nDelta Aquarids Meteor Shower\n\nBest viewing for this shower is where it originates in the southern sky between midnight and dawn on July 29 to 30.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 10.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day.\n\nPerseids Meteor Shower\n\nThe Perseids is the best overall annual meteor shower. While it originates from the northeast, it can usually be seen in every direction.\n\nThe shower peaks on Aug. 11 and 13. Best times to view are midnight to dawn, but fireballs should be visible in the evening, too. Most years, Lassen Volcanic National Park hosts its annual Dark Sky Festival in August to watch the Perseids, with astronomy lectures and telescope viewing opportunities.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 50.\n\nBest view of Saturn\n\nThe solar system’s second largest planet and the one with the brightest rings is most visible on Aug. 27.\n\nSaturn is visible to the naked eye, but its rings and a few of its 83 moons are visible with a basic telescope or powerful astro-binoculars.\n\nBiggest supermoon, blue moon\n\nThe biggest full moon in 2023 happens on Aug. 31. It’s the closest point to Earth any full moon will come in 2023. It will also be a blue moon, the second full moon in August.\n\nOther supermoons appearing almost as large shine July 3, Aug. 1 and Sept. 29.\n\nSolar eclipse with 'ring of fire'\n\nFor the price of a safe pair of eclipse glasses, North Americans can watch a partial solar eclipse on Oct. 14.\n\nThis is a special show for Californians, Nevadans, Texans and southern Oregonians who will be treated to a \"ring of fire\" as the moon passes over the center of the sun. For information on watching safely, go to NASA's solar eclipse safety page.\n\nDraconids Meteor Shower\n\nThis show peaks on Oct. 8 to 10 in the northwest sky. Best times to watch are evening hours before midnight.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: Six, but sometimes hundreds for brief periods.\n\nOrionids Meteor Shower\n\nHalley’s comet created this dust shower, which peaks from Oct. 20 to 21. It originates in the southern sky.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 15.\n\nJupiter shines bright after Halloween\n\nOn Nov. 3, the solar system’s biggest planet will appear at its brightest this year. Jupiter is easily seen with the naked eye, but grab a pair of good binoculars or a telescope for a look at the largest of its 80 moons.\n\nThe gas giant orbits an average of 400 million miles from Earth, but scientists theorize it once spiraled as close as Mars in what is known as the Grant Tack.\n\nTaurids meteor showers\n\nThese long, sparse showers are created when the Earth passes through two debris fields: One left by an asteroid, the other by a comet.\n\nThe South Taurids originate in the southern sky, and peak from Nov. 4 to 5. The North Taurids – which also originate in the southern sky – peak from Nov. 11 to 12. Best times to watch are 10 p.m. to midnight.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: Three to five.\n\nLeonids Meteor Shower\n\nLook to the southern sky to see the Leonids, peaking from Nov. 16 to 18. Best times to watch are between midnight and dawn.\n\nThis meteor shower varies, with a few fizzling fireballs per hour some years, then pounding the atmosphere with hundreds other years. This year will likely be a lighter shower.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 10.\n\nAndromedid Meteor Shower\n\nThis little shower peaks in the late evening on Nov. 25 to 27. It's point of origin is the southern sky.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: Five.\n\nGeminids Meteor Shower\n\nWatch at any time of night to see this groovy shower, peaking on Dec. 13 and 14. It originates from the northeastern sky.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: 75.\n\nUrsids Meteor Shower\n\nThis brief little shower – originating from the northern sky – is from debris left by comet 108P/Tuttle. It peaks on Dec. 21 and 22. Best times to watch are from midnight to dawn.\n\nAverage meteors per hour: Five.\n\nFollow reporter Jessica Skropanic on Twitter @RS_JSkropanic.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/world/meteor-shower-october-orionids-scn/index.html", "title": "The Orionids meteor shower is set to peak this week | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of nature’s most anticipated light shows is set to climax this week, as space debris and dust trails from the famous Comet Halley scatter across the night sky.\n\nThe Orionids meteor shower is expected to peak at 2 p.m. ET on Friday, Oct. 21, but will be best observed earlier in that time zone, between the hours of midnight and dawn. If viewing properly, away from any bright lights and light-polluted areas, viewers can expect to see around 10 to 20 meteors per hour during this time, according to EarthSky.\n\nAs the meteor shower peaks, the moon will be approaching a slim waning crescent, and will no longer be bright enough to obscure the view of the meteors. However, NASA Meteoroid Environment Office lead Bill Cooke suggests looking anywhere in the night sky that is away from the moon to best observe the fireballs.\n\n“It takes about 45 minutes for your eyes to adapt to the dark, so they can be more sensitive and see finer. If you look at your bright phone, a streetlight or the moon, you’re going to ruin that night vision,” Cooke said.\n\nNASA recommends going outside at least 30 minutes prior to watching meteors, to adjust to the night sky.\n\n“Meteor shower observing is something that takes time. You should plan on spending two hours or so outside— it’s not a 15-minute adventure,” Cooke added.\n\nThe meteor shower officially began on Sept. 26 and will last until around Nov. 22, so skywatchers will still have a chance to see the Orionids after the peak.\n\nThe Orionids radiate outward from the constellation Orion the Hunter — specifically a point near Orion’s sword, close to the large red star, Betelgeuse — but you don’t need to know that point’s location to see the meteors; they will appear in all parts of the sky.\n\nNo special equipment is needed to observe meteor showers, and the Orionids are visible from every region in the world, weather permitting.\n\nOrionids origins\n\nWhile the shower’s name originates from its nearest constellation, the meteors themselves are fragments of dust left behind by Halley’s Comet as it orbits the sun, a journey that takes about 76 years.\n\nWhen Earth’s orbit intersects with the comet’s orbit trail, we encounter the Orionids. In early May, we see these same particles at a different point of the comet’s orbit, but there they go under the name of Eta Aquariids meteor shower.\n\n“It occurs about once in a person’s lifetime (that Halley’s Comet is visible from Earth); once every 76 years, so everybody gets one shot at seeing Halley’s Comet,” Cooke said. “For those who haven’t seen Comet Halley, if you don’t want to wait for its return, you can at least go out and see the Orionids.”\n\nHalley’s Comet was last here in 1986 and will return in 2061, but the Orionids come around every year. The meteors tend to be bright and fast moving, and they often leave persistent trails that can glow in the sky for a few seconds after they streak by. The only other meteor showers that produce brighter fireballs are the Perseids and Geminids, according to Cooke.\n\nIn the years of 2006 to 2009, the meteor rates had almost tripled, increasing from 20 per hour to 40 — and sometimes up to 70 per hour. It was unexpected behavior that was caused by Jupiter’s gravitational pull, Cooke said.\n\n“Meteor showers can surprise you,” he added. “This year, the forecast is for normal Orionids’ behavior, but you never know.”\n\nOther space events this year\n\nThere are five more meteor showers you can see in the remainder of 2022, according to EarthSky’s 2022 meteor shower guide:\n\n• November 5: South Taurids\n\n• November 12: North Taurids\n\n• November 18: Leonids\n\n• December 14: Geminids\n\n• December 22: Ursids\n\nThere are two more full moons on the The Old Farmer’s Almanac calendar for 2022:\n\n• November 8: Beaver moon\n\n• December 7: Cold moon\n\nAnd there will be two more eclipses — one solar, one lunar — occurring this year.\n\nThe partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to people in parts of Greenland, Iceland, most of Europe, northeast Africa, and western and central Asia.

The comet, spotted by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, is named C/2022 E3 (ZTF) and will make its closest pass of Earth on February 2.\n\nThe comet should be visible through binoculars in the morning sky for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere during most of January and those in the Southern Hemisphere in early February, according to NASA.\n\nINTERACTIVE: The best space photos of 2022\n\nOn any given day, there is always a good chance that the International Space Station is flying overhead. And if you ever want to know what planets are visible in the morning or evening sky, check The Old Farmer’s Almanac’s calculator.\n\nHere are the rest of 2023’s top sky events, so you can have your binoculars and telescope ready.\n\nFull moons and supermoons\n\nMost years, there are 12 full moons — one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two occurring in August.\n\nThe second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase “once in a blue moon,” according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases don’t always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2.5 years.\n\nThe two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky.\n\nSome astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.\n\nHere is the list of full moons for 2023, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\nJanuary 6: Wolf moon\n\nFebruary 5: Snow moon\n\nMarch 7: Worm moon\n\nApril 6: Pink moon\n\nMay 5: Flower moon\n\nJune 3: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 3: Buck moon\n\nAugust 1: Sturgeon moon\n\nAugust 30: Blue moon\n\nSeptember 29: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 28: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 27: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 26: Cold moon\n\nWhile these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moon, each one carries its own significance across Native American tribes (with many also referred to by differing names).\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses in 2023.\n\nA total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun.\n\nAnd for some skywatchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will actually be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earth’s surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moon’s shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA.\n\nLike a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth during an annular eclipse — but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesn’t completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.\n\nA Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across North, Central and South America.\n\nBe sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nMeanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.\n\nWhen the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red — which is why the event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n\nDepending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it on the moon.\n\nA total lunar eclipse appeared in the skies of Canta, east of Lima on May 15, 2022. Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earth’s shadow.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon don’t completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nThe new year kicks off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is expected to peak in the overnight hours between January 3 and 4 for those in North America, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nIt’s the first of 12 meteor showers throughout the year, although the next one, the Lyrid meteor shower, doesn’t peak until April.\n\nHere are peak dates of other showers to watch in 2023:\n\nLyrids: April 22-23\n\nEta Aquariids: May 5-6\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 30-31\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30-31\n\nPerseids: August 12-13\n\nOrionids: October 20-21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4-5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11-12\n\nLeonids: November 17-18\n\nGeminids: December 13-14\n\nUrsids: December 21-22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights. If you’re able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from late evening until dawn.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone! — so the meteors will be easier to spot.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/world/harvest-moon-september-2022-scn/index.html", "title": "September full moon: How to see the harvest moon | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you need a sign other than pumpkin spice lattes that fall is in the air, look no further than the harvest moon.\n\nStargazers can view the moon beginning around sunset on Friday, and it will peak at 5:59 a.m. ET Saturday, according to NASA.\n\nThis lunar event is called the harvest moon because it is close to the fall equinox, a time when farmers often harvest their crops, NASA said.\n\nIn 2022, September’s full moon is closest to the autumnal equinox, which falls on September 22, so it’s called the harvest moon, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. When October’s full moon is closer to the equinox, it gets the name harvest moon, and September’s is called the corn moon.\n\nThe harvest moon first emerges around sunset on Friday and rises 25 minutes later each day in the northern United States and 10 to 20 minutes later in Canada and Europe, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. Once the moon moves into its next phase, it returns to its normal schedule of rising 50 minutes later each day.\n\nOther full moons during the year remain on that 50-minute timeline, according to EarthSky.\n\nThe earlier rising time of the harvest moon happens in the Northern Hemisphere near the autumnal equinox when the moon’s orbit is closest with the Eastern horizon, The Old Farmer’s Almanac said. The moon’s orbit moves about 12 degrees to the east each day, but because September’s full moon is so close to the horizon, it rises sooner than usual, according to the almanac.\n\nMoonlight lasts from dawn to dusk for a few nights in a row, which gives farmers light to continue working at night, EarthSky said.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, this effect occurs around the spring equinox in either March or April, according to EarthSky.\n\nWhen the moon begins its ascent into the sky, it may look a burnt orange hue. This is because there is a thicker layer of the Earth’s atmosphere along the horizon compared with directly above our heads, according to EarthSky.\n\nThat atmosphere acts as a filter, transforming the moon into the eerie color when it first emerges above the horizon.\n\nThe harvest moon may also appear larger in the sky compared with other full moons, but your eyes are playing a trick on you.\n\nAny full moon will look bigger along the horizon, so the harvest moon’s location close to the skyline makes this optical illusion more noticeable, EarthSky said.\n\nRemaining events in 2022\n\nThree more full moons will occur this year, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\n• October 9: Hunter’s moon\n\n• November 8: Beaver moon\n\n• December 7: Cold moon\n\nNative American tribes have different names for the full moons, such as the Cheyenne tribe’s “drying grass moon” for the one happening in September, and the Arapaho tribe’s “popping trees” for the full moon occurring in December.\n\nCatch the peak of these upcoming meteor shower events later this year, according to EarthSky’s 2022 meteor shower guide:\n\n• Draconids: October 8-9\n\n• Orionids: October 20-21\n\n• South Taurids: November 5\n\n• North Taurids: November 12\n\n• Leonids: November 17-18\n\n• Geminids: December 13-14\n\n• Ursids: December 22-23\n\nAnd there will be one more total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in 2022, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. The partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to people in parts of Greenland, Iceland, most of Europe, northeast Africa, and western and central Asia.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse on November 8 can be seen in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America between 3:02 and 8:56 a.m. ET. But for people in eastern North America, the moon will be setting during that time.\n\nWear proper eclipse glasses to view solar eclipses safely as the sun’s light can damage the eyes.", "authors": ["Megan Marples Ashley Strickland", "Megan Marples", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/world/august-full-moon-sturgeon-moon-scn/index.html", "title": "August full moon: When to see the sturgeon supermoon | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nTonight’s sturgeon supermoon could have you dancing in the moonlight – the type that only happens three to four times per year.\n\nNamed by the Native American Algonquin tribe after sturgeon fish that were more easily caught in the Great Lakes and other bodies of water during this time of year, the sturgeon moon ends 2022’s series of four supermoons, which began in May, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. After sunset, look toward the southeast to watch this supermoon rise. It will reach peak illumination at 9:36 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\n“At certain times of the year, the moon is at its closest point to Earth and these are called supermoons,” said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society, via email. “It’s just a natural point of the moon’s orbit. At each extreme, the moon is either a little bigger or a little bit smaller (at its furthest point), but it is not a huge difference.”\n\nThis nearest proximity is called the perigee, and it is only about 226,000 miles (363,300 kilometers) from Earth, according to NASA. That’s why a supermoon also appears slightly brighter than a regular full moon. The moon’s distance from Earth changes throughout the month since its orbit isn’t a perfect circle, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nIf you take a cool photo of the supermoon, you could share it on social media with the hashtag #NASAMoonSnap – the phrase NASA is using to track moon-inspired content leading up to the late-summer launch of Artemis I, the first test flight of the rocket and spacecraft that will send future astronauts to the moon, according to NASA’s Tumblr. The agency has shared a guide for photographing the moon, and will share some users’ content on its social media platforms during the launch broadcast.\n\nThe sturgeon moon will steal the spotlight of the Perseid meteor shower peaking Thursday through Saturday.\n\n“Bright moon phases are bad for meteor showers as they wash out the dimmer meteors,” Hankey said. “A full or almost full moon dominates one part of the sky, making that part undesirable for observing meteors. The full moon also lasts the entire night, leaving no hours of complete darkness, which is preferred.”\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower lasts from July 14 to September 1, and this year’s barely visible peak will happen at 11 p.m. ET on Friday (3:00 a.m. UTC Saturday), according to EarthSky. In previous years, the Perseids have been a highly anticipated shower in the Northern Hemisphere, where it’s usually more visible. But that’s only when the moon isn’t in a phase dominating the sky.\n\nThis year, the Perseids – which strengthen in number from late evening to early dawn – were more visible in early August when the moon appeared smaller and dimmer. In previous years, they were most visible in nearly moon-free skies.\n\nThe shower’s fragments come from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun just once, according to NASA. The comet last entered the inner solar system in 1992.\n\nThe supermoon — also called the sturgeon moon — rises as a jetliner approaches John F.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe new year kicks off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is expected to peak in the overnight hours from Sunday to Monday.\n\nThe Quadrantids are typically among the strongest meteor showers of the year. Fortunately, a waxing crescent moon phase will practically render the moon invisible overnight, allowing for peak visibility of the meteors.\n\nStill, the shower is notoriously hard to observe due to January’s difficult weather and its short peak of only about six hours. It will be best seen in the Northern Hemisphere between the late-night hours Sunday and dawn on Monday, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nBrief but intense peak\n\nMeanwhile, the International Meteor Organization predicts the peak will occur around 20:40 Universal Time on January 3, which will be best visible for those in Eastern Asia. Those in higher-latitude places across Europe will also be able to see some meteor activity, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nThe Quadrantids aren’t usually visible in the Southern Hemisphere because the radiant point of the shower doesn’t rise very high in its sky before dawn.\n\nCheck Time and Date to see what your chances are like, or step outside to take a look for yourself. The Virtual Telescope Project will also have a livestream of the shower over Rome.\n\nBetween 50 and 100 meteors are typically visible per hour, especially in rural areas, although the peak can include up to 120 visible meteors in an hour. Watch the northeastern sky, and look about halfway up. You may even glimpse some fireballs during the meteor shower. Watch the skies for at least an hour, the American Meteor Society advises.\n\nUnusual origins\n\nIf the meteor shower’s name sounds odd, it’s probably because it doesn’t sound like it’s related to a constellation, like other meteor showers. That’s because the Quadrantids’ namesake constellation no longer exists – at least, not as a recognized constellation.\n\nThe constellation Quadrans Muralis, first observed and noted in 1795 between Boötes and Draco, is no longer included in the International Astronomical Union’s list of modern constellations because it is considered obsolete. The meteor shower radiates between the Big Dipper and Bootes.\n\nLike the Geminid meteor shower, the Quadrantid comes from a mysterious asteroid or “rock comet,” rather than an icy comet, which is unusual. This particular asteroid is 2003 EH1, which takes 5.52 years to complete one orbit around the sun.\n\nThe shower’s peak is short because only a small stream of particles interacts with our atmosphere, and the stream occurs at a perpendicular angle. Each year, Earth passes through this debris trail for a short time.\n\nHow to watch\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights that will obstruct your view. If you can find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple minutes from late evening until dawn.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky, and don’t forget to bundle up. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up.

About one meteor strikes per hour during the shower season, yet during the peak, one to two strikes happen per minute.\n\nIn recent years, the Perseid shower has not been fully visible due to the moon’s illumination. However, this year the moon will be a waning crescent, casting just a sliver of light and leading to better visibility, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nThe one hiccup might be the weather, with showers and clouds in the forecast.\n\nIf you’re interested in watching this beautiful display this year, read for details and tips below.\n\nWhat is a meteor/meteor shower?\n\nA meteor is the scientific name for a shooting star, and they are caused by trains of dust entering the Earth’s atmosphere from space. When Earth crosses a comet’s orbit and its debris enters the atmosphere, a meteor shower occurs.\n\nMeteor showers are visible because the pieces of comet debris heat as they enter Earth’s atmosphere, causing them to burn as a bright light.\n\nWhat is a Perseid meteor?\n\nPerseid meteors are about the size of a grain of sand. They reach temperatures of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and travel at speeds over 133,000 mph, becoming visible at about 60 miles from the ground.\n\nMore:Want to admire the cosmos? Here's a beginner's guide to stargazing in Rhode Island\n\nHistory of the Perseid shower\n\nThe Perseids result from the Swift-Tuttle comet, currently the largest known object to repeatedly pass Earth, with a 16-mile-wide nucleus.\n\nThe comet passes through the inner solar system every 133 years, leaving behind debris that Earth passes through each August. Its last pass by Earth was in 1992, and its next will be in 2126.\n\nThe first record of a Perseid shower comes from 36 AD. Although the Swift-Tuttle comet was discovered in 1862, it was not linked to the shower for four more years.\n\nTips for the best viewing experience\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower is the most visible in the Northern Hemisphere, and viewing access extends down to the mid-southern latitudes. All you need to view the shower is darkness – no telescope required – but visibility is best during pre-dawn hours on peak days. To improve your viewing experience, see the tips below.\n\nFind the darkest possible location, away from city or street lights. In Rhode Island, the areas with the least light pollution are the less developed areas in the western half of the state and by the shoreline. For the darkest skies in the state, Block Island's beaches will give you the best light conditions to watch the meteor shower.\n\nAllow 20-30 minutes to allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness. Once adjusted, avoid looking at lights, including cellphones, which will ruin your night vision. If light is necessary, try a red flashlight.\n\nFace away from the moon, and gaze at the darkest part of the sky.\n\nLook for the Perseus constellation, the point of origin for the meteors. The constellation – which is said to resemble the Greek hero Perseus holding the head of the Gorgon Medusa in one hand and a diamond sword above his head in the other – is located near the more easily found Cassiopeia constellation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}]}

What to know", "text": "It's one of those $1.58 billion problems that you actually wish you had.\n\nOne lucky player in Florida matched all six numbers in Tuesday night's drawing to win the Mega Millions jackpot, ending a stretch of lottery futility that had stretched for nearly four months.\n\nIf you had won, you might wonder what you would have done: \"Take the lump sum payment or the long-term payout?\"\n\nYeah, it's a problem we all wish we could have soon. Oh, there are other concerns, too, so while you still have a chance to worry about winning, let's get to them:\n\nWhat's one of the biggest mistakes you can make when you win Mega Millions?\n\nMaybe, like, bragging? Letting too many \"friends\" know your good luck?\n\nThe historic Mega Millions jackpot for Tuesday's drawing was estimated at $1.58 billion — or $783.3 million for those who opt for a lump-sum cash option. Jackpots are impossible to predict in advance to the penny because it's unknown how the latest frenzy could build.\n\nThe Mega Millions tickets cost $2 per play.\n\nMega Millions has awarded four jackpots exceeding $1 billion — one in 2018, 2021, 2022 and one in January 2023.\n\nIn 2021, a small Oakland County, Michigan, group called \"Wolverine FLL Lottery Club\" hit the $1.05 billion jackpot. The group opted for the cash option or lump sum of $776.6 million before taxes, according to Jake Harris, player relations manager for the Michigan Lottery.\n\nOne person served as the group's representative and spokesperson — Kurt D. Panouses, a Florida estate planning attorney with a lottery practice, who Harris said was a member of that club. The identities of the other members of the group were not disclosed.\n\nIf you won the Mega Millions jackpot in Michigan, Harris said, you're required to go public for transparency. If you won as part of a group, he said, the Michigan Lottery generally works with one member of the club to serve as a representative and spokesperson to fulfill the media obligations for the group.\n\nThe 2021 winning ticket in Michigan was bought at a Kroger store in Novi. The winners had a choice between accepting the prize as a graduated annuity or as a lump sum.\n\nYou win a billion — or take home hundreds of millions at once — and the word will no doubt spread.\n\n\"Be careful who you tell,\" advises Holli Armstrong, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Education Lottery. \"You may not want to post it on social media. It's not a good idea.\"\n\nTypically, lottery experts suggest you sign the back of your ticket if you've got a winner, put the ticket in a super safe place and be extremely careful who you tell. If your husband or wife has a big mouth, maybe don't tell them too early in the process. Big lottery winners are often encouraged to take their time to line up a team of legal, financial and tax advisers before claiming a major prize.\n\nThe record Mega Millions jackpot was $1.537 billion, won in South Carolina in 2018. The winner — who wasn't part of a lottery club or group — won the whole thing and decided to take the lump sum of $877 million, Armstrong said. One person — all that money.\n\nThe winner remained anonymous, Armstrong said, as is allowed in South Carolina, and only described as a “South Carolinian.”\n\nThat winner, oddly enough, was pretty polite and reportedly allowed a fellow customer at the KC Mart convenience store in Simpsonville, South Carolina, to jump ahead in line to buy a ticket just before the winning ticket was sold.\n\n“A simple act of kindness led to an amazing outcome,” the lottery commission said in a statement when announcing that a winner had come forward in March 2019, a few months after the Oct. 23, 2018 drawing.\n\nNo, the winner did not get to sign the back of a big check and drive it over to the bank. Instead, Armstrong said, the money was sent via wire transfer to the winner's account.\n\nOut of eight Mega Millions jackpot winners in South Carolina since 2002, all have taken the lump sum cash option, Armstrong said.\n\nShould you take the lottery lump sum or extend payouts?\n\nPersonally, if I ever played the lottery and I do not, my first instinct would be to take all the money and run. But that's not usually the best advice for a long list of reasons. I know it and you probably know it, too.\n\n\"From a tax standpoint, it usually makes sense to spread out your lottery receipts and avoid taking the lump sum payout,\" said James Hines, the Richard A. Musgrave Collegiate Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nBut if you think, as some do, he said, that tax rates on the very rich — and yes, you'd be very rich — will skyrocket in the future, you might consider the lump sum.\n\nLottery winnings will be taxed at the federal level and potentially at the state level.\n\nA Michigan winner might view the state's lower income tax rate in 2023 as an incentive to take a lump sum this year, said Lisa Pohl, principal and director for state and local tax for Rehmann in Grand Rapids. The state income tax rate for 2023 in Michigan has dropped to 4.05% but the state's income tax rate will return to 4.25% in 2024.\n\nA Michigan winner might view the state's lower income tax rate in 2023 as an incentive to take a lump sum this year, said Lisa Pohl, principal and director for state and local tax for Rehmann in Grand Rapids. The state income tax rate for 2023 in Michigan has dropped to 4.05% but the state's income tax rate will return to 4.25% in 2024.\n\nLottery winnings are considered “ordinary taxable income,” said Mark Steber, chief tax information officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Services. The highest federal tax rate is 37% and that's where big winners end up.\n\nMore federal taxes will be owed, Steber said, once the taxpayer files their 2023 federal income taxes based on their total taxable income.\n\nOn an estimated lump sum of $757.2 million before taxes, (and before the final winnings were announced late Tuesday) the federal withholding is estimated to be $181.7 million if 24% is withheld. That would bring the payout to around $575 million.\n\nThe lump sum payout would drop further if state income taxes are withheld, depending on the state.\n\nIf you're spreading out the Mega Millions payments in the latest jackpot for 30 years, Steber said, you'd likely get $23.3 million in the first year before taxes. Then, you'd get payments each year for the next 29 years, Steber said.\n\nThe total payment each year increases by about 5%, with the last payment in the final year being about $96 million before taxes, according to an Omni Calculator online called \"Mega Millions Payout Calculator.\"\n\nTotal payouts before taxes after 30 years will equal the total amount won.\n\nMake no mistake, you're still paying taxes on those payments over 30 years. For example, federal taxes on the first year's $23.3 million would be nearly $8.6 million alone that year.\n\nIf you died early, Steber said, you could include the remaining winnings in your will.\n\nWhy could a lump sum work?\n\nThe winner, of course, has more control over more money by taking a lump sum.\n\n\"By taking the lump sum option, you get the money today, you pay the taxes on it today and you control what you do with the funds you receive,\" said Henry Grzes, lead manager for Tax Practice & Ethics with the American Institute of CPAs.\n\nYou'd know you'd pay a 37% top tax rate at the federal level now. The top federal tax rate over the last 30 years, Grzes said, has fluctuated.\n\nFor example, the top bracket hit 39.6% in 1990s. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act of 2001 then dropped the highest income tax rate to 35% from 2003 to 2010. And then the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased the highest income tax rate to 39.6% again.\n\nThe highest income tax rate was lowered to 37% for tax years beginning in 2018.\n\nIf you take the annuity, Grzes said, you get the money over 30 years in equal installments, plus a 5% annual increase each year and you'd pay taxes over those 30 years, again, based on the current tax rate each year.\n\nSome people, Grzes said, might believe they could get a better rate of return than 5% a year if they took that lump sum now and invested it, instead of opting for payouts for 30 years.\n\nMaybe they can do better. But maybe they can't.\n\n\"From a financial management perspective,\" U-M's Hines said, \"the good feature of taking a lump sum payout is that you have access to the money immediately. And, of course, the bad feature is that you get access to the money immediately.\"\n\nOne big problem that lottery winners can face is that everybody finds out that you're a lottery winner.\n\nFamily, friends, people who pretend to be friends, Hines said, all can insist that you share this newfound wealth. You can end up picking up the tab for everything.\n\nAnd many have sure-fire ideas for making even more money — as if you need to do that if you win $1 billion or more.\n\nThe pressure from family and friends can be another good reason not to take the lump sum payout, Hines said.\n\n\"Annuitizing the payments will not address all of the issues, but at least it affords the winner the chance to learn over time who to trust and how to manage the newfound affluence.\"\n\nHow much resolve will you have to simply learn key phrases? Maybe phrases like: \"I'm good, thank you,\" \"No, I'm not interested,\" and \"Never in my wildest dreams would I give you that money.\"\n\nYou cannot simply collect the Mega Millions jackpot and keep spending a billion dollars as if you could never run out of money. You could — and you would if you listen to too many people.\n\n\"The biggest mistake you can make is to take the lump sum,\" Hines said, \"and then do with the money what those around you want you to do.\"\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Vaughn Correctional Center left the prison with too few officers to conduct random cell searches for weapons and to protect colleagues when an 18-hour siege broke out on Feb. 1, a new federal lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday by attorneys representing the widow of Lt. Steven Floyd Sr. – who was killed during the siege – and five other prison employees held hostage, says Delaware officials put money before safety for more than 16 years.\n\nThe standoff in Building C was a direct result of Govs. Ruth Ann Minner's and Jack Markell's administrations understaffing the Department of Correction, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"Instead, they spent up to $23 million a year forcing understaffed officers to work 16-hour overtime shifts to save money at the expense of putting their lives at risk at the hands of violent offenders,\" said Thomas Neuberger, one of the attorneys bringing the lawsuit.\n\nLAWSUIT: View the full complaint (Note: This document contains graphic descriptions of violence)\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, says the shortage – particularly under Markell's watch – led to an increase in violence at Vaughn, including the assault of at least 25 prison workers in the fall of 2016.\n\n\"These major incidents of violence continued, unabated because there was not enough security staff to deal with, prevent and control them,\" according to the 52-page civil complaint.\n\nEven though current Gov. John Carney is not listed as a defendant in the case, the lawsuit claims that Carney overruled the warden's decision to retake Building C about an hour into the siege, delaying Floyd's rescue until the next day when the 16-year DOC veteran was already dead.\n\nThis violated the prison's emergency preparedness training, policies and procedures that govern the rescue of hostages and \"enraged\" former Warden David Pierce, who has since been reassigned to the Bureau of Community Corrections, the lawsuit says.\n\nA spokesman for Carney denied that the governor overruled the warden or the commissioner.\n\n\"The hostage negotiations were conducted by trained professionals from the Department of Correction and Delaware State Police,\" spokesman Jonathan Starkey said. \"The governor trusted his law enforcement team on the ground to make decisions on how best to respond throughout the incident. Those decisions led to the rescue of three correctional employees. Tragically, Lieutenant Floyd lost his life.\"\n\nMinner and Markell could not be reached for comment.\n\nAn hour after the lawsuit was filed, Neuberger and attorney Thomas Crumplar held a press conference at the Westin Wilmington on the Riverfront.\n\nThey were joined by some of the hostages and Floyd's wife, Saundra, who wiped away tears as she stood silently next to an enlarged picture of the couple with their three children and two grandsons from Christmas.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of Saundra and their children, as well as correctional officers Winslow H. Smith and Joshua Wilkinson, who were held hostage during the siege, and maintenance workers Cpl. Justin Tuxward, Cpl. Matthew McCall and Cpl. Owen Hammond, who barricaded themselves in the basement after inmates took over the building.\n\nThe Neuberger Firm and Jacobs & Crumplar are also representing Patricia May, a civilian counselor held during the siege. May is not part of Tuesday's filing.\n\nSTORY: Prison siege choreographed; officers beaten for hours\n\nSTORY: Former Delaware justice, retired judge to lead prison review\n\nNeuberger said his clients are suffering tremendously from the February ordeal and that being at the press conference was like \"ripping a Band-Aid off a festering wound.\"\n\n\"The public deserves to see the face of law enforcement behind our prison walls, to understand the persons doing the difficult job of keeping our families safe from very violent people who would do nothing but harm our families,\" he said. \"My hostage clients are presently the walking wounded. They are suffering from constant flashbacks, nightmares, terror, insomnia, PTSD.\"\n\n“They are not the thugs interest groups would like to portray,\" Neuberger said.\n\nThe lawyers say the 16-year period during which the state allowed danger to exist and hid it from the Legislature \"shocks the conscience,\" a legal test to determine which situations are so unjust or wrong the court must intervene, and violated their clients' Fourteenth Amendment right of due process.\n\n\"We cannot comment on pending litigation,\" said Jayme Gravell, spokeswoman for the Department of Correction, \"However, Commissioner [Perry] Phelps is working hand-in-hand with Governor Carney and members of the General Assembly to make improvements to the safety and security of DOC facilities.\"\n\nDelaware's prisons used to be highly secure, well-staffed places with sufficient numbers of correctional officers, according to the complaint. That changed shortly after Minner took office in 2001.\n\n\"The essential pillars of any properly functioning prison system, as DOC once was, began to break down,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nFor example, vacant correctional officer positions were not filled despite obligations under union contracts, the lawsuit says. Minner and her prison senior staff ordered the removal of vacant job positions around the same time the DOC's human resources director testified that the department had \"literally hundreds of vacancies,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nVIDEO: Watch the full press conference\n\n\"By eliminating these positions, the Minner defendants created the appearance that DOC was only short a certain number of officers, while in reality the DOC was greatly and severely understaffed by an even larger number of officers,\" the lawsuit says, adding the move hid the \"true extent of the understaffing from the general public and from the Delaware General Assembly.\"\n\nThe shortage created the need for forced overtime, a DOC policy known as \"freezing.\" This meant correctional officers were forced to stay on at the end of their shifts to work another shift because there was no officer to replace them, creating hazardous conditions, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe policy and low pay led to a weekslong protest in late July 2004 when correctional officers refused voluntary overtime, which in part was used to pay officers to transport prisoners. Inmates were not taken to court hearings, forcing the rescheduling of more than 100 hearings in New Castle County alone.\n\nState attorneys filed a motion asking then-Chancery Court Chancellor William B. Chandler III to order the officers to stop refusing voluntary overtime. Chandler denied the temporary restraining order.\n\nIn addition to reducing staff, the lawsuit claims Minner eliminated necessary training of correctional officers. This led to major security breakdowns, including an inmate escaping en route to court, a defendant slitting his neck with a razor blade during a trial, and a prisoner on two occasions swallowing handcuff keys while on his way to court and to the hospital.\n\nSecurity lapses also were at the root of the July 12, 2004, abduction and rape of a Vaughn prison counselor by serial rapist Scott A. Miller.\n\nA report commissioned by Minner found staff shortages that forced officers to work large amounts of overtime was the central issue facing the prison system.\n\nThrough the remainder of her time in office, Minner's administration ignored the report and prison safety deteriorated, the lawsuit claims. Markell's administration continued the trend by relying on overtime instead of filling correctional officer positions, the lawsuit says.\n\nIn Markell's first year, DOC employees worked approximately 500,000 hours of overtime, according to the lawsuit. By 2015, the number rose to almost 800,000.\n\n\"That is the equivalent of needing an additional 470 employees,\" the lawsuit says, adding that early this year, 40 percent of staffing at Vaughn was filled by correctional officers working overtime.\n\nEven the DOC's 2015 annual report explained the staff shortage, saying \"an insufficient number of reporting staff temporarily causes working officers to be frozen at a post until relieved. When correctional officer vacancies remain unfilled, the facilities operate without a full workforce compliment for extended periods of time. Covering security posts with officers who are unfamiliar with the tasks or post location elevates security risk.\"\n\nBecause of the severe staff shortages under Markell's administration, the DOC halted the practice of specialized security teams that performed random security sweeps for weapons and contraband at Vaughn.\n\n\"In late 2016 and early 2017, there were numerous reports up the chain of command from correctional officers and maintenance staff at [Vaughn] that fixtures and other pieces of equipment at [Vaughn] had been tampered with and numerous pieces of metal removed from them,\" the lawsuit says, claiming this is a well-known method by prisoners to make weapons. \"However, because of the severe levels of understaffing, no searches or shakedowns were conducted to look for these contraband weapons which were known to exist.\"\n\nAbout this same time period, the lawsuit says prisoners in Building C had begun conducting \"dry runs,\" of inmate-on-inmate fights in Building C to learn weak points within the prison.\n\nNumerous correctional officers filed reports about these \"red flag incidents\" and requested additional staffing, security sweeps to search for contraband and weapons, and transfers of dangerous inmates to other buildings \"in order to nip the problem in the bud,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe DOC took no action, the lawsuit says, despite public pleas by the officers' union leader.\n\n\"Sometime between January and July, the wheels are going to come off,\" Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, told The News Journal in August. \"There's a good chance we'll require the National Guard's assistance to maintain safety and security in the facilities.\"\n\nKlopp's comments came after convicted cop killer Derrick Powell punched a correctional officer in the face at Vaughn. Powell was sentenced to death after his 2011 conviction for fatally shooting Georgetown police Officer Chad Spicer in 2009.\n\nKlopp again warned of imminent danger in December, according to the lawsuit, this time when he said that \"assaults are dramatically increasing. We have been virtually ignored for the past eight years. This cannot continue. Someone is bound to be seriously injured – or even worse.\"\n\nTwo months later, more than 100 inmates took over Building C, killing Floyd, an Army veteran.\n\nThe lawsuit says Building C, a location in which inmates are transitioned between higher or lower security levels, was historically known as the most dangerous building in the prison. It also was a building that had no cameras, Crumplar said.\n\n\"None of us can walk into a Target, a Wal-Mart, a Johnnies Dog House without seeing security cameras,\" he said. \"But in the very building where Lt. Floyd lost his life, where these gentlemen suffered periods of torture and imprisonment, how many cameras do you think there were in that building? Zero.\"\n\nCarney has launched a separate investigation by former Delaware Supreme Court Justice Henry duPont Ridgely and former Judge William L. Chapman Jr.\n\nNeuberger said that while they will likely conclude the prisons are understaffed, it is up to the governor and General Assembly to not ignore this fact like prior administrations did.\n\nThe Rev. Christopher Bullock, with the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice, has called for an independent federal investigation. He's led hearings in which the families of inmates have described torture and poor conditions in the prisons.\n\n\"There will be an attempt to push our agenda to the side, but it won't work because we have hundreds of people who are concerned about this issue, not only now, but for decades,\" Bullock said. \"The people, the family members of those who are incarcerated, the family of correctional officers are demanding change. This is about people's lives.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking money awards for Floyd's family for his death and for the five officers who are suffering emotionally, mentally and financially due to lost wages, benefits, pension and retirement, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"What is the fundamental purpose of any government? It is to protect us,\" Crumplar said. \"And, these people were involved in protecting us, and they were not given the tools.\n\n\"They are the forgotten heroes. Let us pray and hope they are the forgotten heroes no more.\"\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777 or jmreyes@delawareonline.com.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Business Journal last month, CEO Chris Gheysens said Wawa wants to have nearly 2,000 stores by 2030.\n\nTo reach that mark the company will double the pace of its annual growth, aiming to open about 100 stores every year. Gheysens said customers should expect Wawa to \"fill in the market\" between Virginia and Florida. The company has already announced it is looking at sites for an expansion to North Carolina by 2024.\n\nIn Delaware, at least five stores are at various stages of the development pipeline. According to Wawa's website, the first expected new location is at Route 40 and Bear Christiana Road in Bear. It will be a new construction in place of an older Wawa.\n\nDeveloper Dennis Silicato told Delaware Online/The News Journal last year that he expects a Wawa to open at Edwards Street and Route 113 in Georgetown this spring or summer.\n\nThe Pennsylvania-based company is also eyeing the Leon's Garden World property at Elkton and Otts Chapel roads on the outskirts of Newark.

Other giveaways includes hundreds or thousands of dollars in cash, cruises or trips to Bermuda.\n\n$100 savings bonds, or win the lottery\n\nState governments have joined this tsunami of subornation, starting with West Virginia in late April promising $100 savings bonds to residents ages 16-35 who get the shot. Since then, state giveaways have gone through the roof, with millions of dollars in payoffs promised in Colorado, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oregon and, most recently, California, which will dole out $116.5 million in prizes that include $1.5 million to each of 10 vaccinated residents chosen at random.\n\nDoes any of this work?\n\nAmericans prodded by pollsters have conceded that, well, yes, Mary Poppins was right, a spoonful of sugar does help the medicine go down. About a third of the unvaccinated said a cash payment could make all the difference. (The incentive was stronger among Democrats than Republicans, for whatever that's worth.)\n\n'How many people will die if we don't do this?'\n\nIn being the first of governors to push for million dollar promotional drawing giveaways, Ohio's Mike DeWine wrote in an opinion piece that his target was that group of people who are just noncommittal about getting the shot. He said he was guided by a single question: \"How many people will die if we don't do this?\"\n\nThat potential loss of life, combined with the cost of health care and diminished productivity when people get COVID-19, far outweighs the expense of the promotional giveaway, DeWine wrote.\n\nAnd in the end, according to a review by The Associated Press, the number of Ohioans 16 and older who got vaccinated in the week after the governor announced his lottery increased by 33%.\n\nLast week, 22-year-old Abbigail Bugenske of Silverton, Ohio, became the first of what will be five million-dollar recipients for getting the COVID-19 vaccine. “It was a crazy night,\" she told reporters.\n\nDetractors may say that it's unseemly to pay people to do the sensible thing, or that the money could be better used. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is financing his state's giveaway with federal coronavirus relief funds. But DeWine has it right. What's most important is lives saved.\n\nSo go ahead and get the shot.

That could entice more drivers to buy fuel in the First State, transportation experts say, boosting Delaware's tax revenue.\n\n\"We're going to look at both New Jersey and Delaware residents shifting their gas-buying habits\" to Delaware, said Ken Grant, spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic. \"We've seen that with cigarette taxes increases. We've seen that with other taxes.\"\n\nNew Jersey has long had the cheapest gas in the region, but Republican Gov. Chris Christie is expected to sign the tax increase into law, causing prices to surge above those in Delaware. Christie – a previous opponent of a fuel tax increase – helped craft the bill in an effort to divert more money to road construction and maintenance. He has expressed support because it will also cut sales and estate taxes.\n\nSTORY: Delaware City adapts as bridge cuts off key connector\n\nSTORY: Delaware school district accused of segregation\n\nThe average price of a gallon of gasoline in New Jersey Monday was $2.02, according to AAA. In Delaware, it was $2.14. Those prices are notably lower than during much of the past decade when a gallon of fuel surpassed $3.\n\nDelaware charges a tax of 23 cents for each gallon of gasoline purchased in the state. Pennsylvania currently charges 50.3 cents and Maryland, 32.6 cents. Until the increase takes effect, New Jersey will continue to charge 10.5 cents at the pump, and also impose a 4 cent-per-gallon tax on refinery and distributor sales.\n\nThe federal government tacks on another 18.4 cents for each gallon of gasoline.\n\nJoe Rickards, a Newport resident, normally buys gas near his job in Woodstown, New Jersey, because of the lower prices there. On Monday, he purchased a few gallons at a station in New Castle – just enough to allow his car to get to cheaper fuel in New Jersey or at B.J.'s Wholesale Club. His habits will change, he said, as soon as prices jump on the other side of the Delaware River.\n\n\"I'm probably won't bother to buy in Jersey,\" he said. \"It won't make much of a difference.\"\n\nThe hike would start Nov. 1 or two weeks after it is signed into law, whichever is later.\n\nMore than 5,700 Delaware residents commuted to New Jersey in 2010, according to the Census Bureau. Delaware Department of Transportation spokesman Geoff Sundstrom anticipates some of those drivers, as well as those commuting the opposite direction, will opt to buy fuel in the First State after the gas take hike goes into effect.\n\nWhile the likely boost to Delaware tax revenues will provide a “marginal benefit,\" he said, it is not a long-term fix for an uncertain transportation funding future. Gas tax revenues across the country are expected to decline as more people purchase vehicles powered by electricity.\n\nProposals to increase fuel taxes at the General Assembly in Dover have failed in recent years, despite support from Gov. Jack Markell.\n\nThe Delaware Legislature in 2015 passed a bill that increased fees charged at the Division of Motor Vehicles to bridge the divide between gas tax revenue and growing transportation infrastructure costs. There is enough money to build and maintain roads for the next six years, Sundstrom said, but that won't be the case in 10-15 years.\n\nIn July, DelDOT won a federal grant to examining the feasibility of a road-use fee, as a gas tax replacement.\n\nNew Jersey's move will make raising gas taxes in Delaware more politically feasible, said Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark.\n\nBaumbach said Delaware would be \"leaving money on the table\" with the region's lowest fuel prices at a time when is it critical to rebuild the state's transportation infrastructure.\n\n“We’ve been hampered by the artificially low (gas prices) in New Jersey\" in the past, he said.\n\nRep. Michael Ramone, R-Middle Run Valley, said Delaware should wait one or two years before even considering a gas tax increase. Because New Jersey lawmakers made the tough decision to raise gas tax rates, Delaware's legislature might not have to.\n\n“I’m ecstatic that New Jersey finally buckled,” Ramon said.\n\nTravelers buying fuel also may purchase other items as gas stations, helping the wider economy, he said.\n\nBaumbach said a likely compromise would be to increase Delaware’s gas tax a few cents to preserve the state’s rank as cheapest while satisfying future needs.\n\n\"You don't want to be absurdly inexpensive,\" Baumbach said. \"It's bad for our roads and bridges.\"\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

The real number is 277 positions, meaning each one, to date, has cost ratepayers almost $470,000.\n\nThe median annual household income in Delaware, according to the U.S. Census, is $60,235.\n\nAnd the surcharge continues until 2033.\n\nDefenders of the deal say the surcharge on Delmarva's Delaware customers was necessary to achieve the state's goal of having 25 percent of its energy come from renewable sources by 2025. Had this money not gone to Bloom, they said, it would have gone to an out-of-state wind or solar company that would not have created any jobs in Delaware.\n\n\"The surcharge is paying for energy created in Delaware as opposed to going elsewhere,\" Gov. Jack Markell said.\n\nDan Simmons, vice president of policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that studies government regulation of energy markets, said having ratepayers subsidize a private energy business is unusual.\n\n\"Bloom was given a whole bunch of incentives and the surcharge, which is very strange,\" he said. \"It looks like Delaware was doing everything it could to give Bloom money.\"\n\nSimmons questioned the wisdom of such a deal, noting that since so-called Bloom Boxes are similar to a natural gas power plant, it would have been cheaper just to build a plant.\n\n\"This is a serious sweetheart deal,\" he said. \"It didn't matter if the state took one part of the subsidies away, Bloom would still get money over time. Every business would want that deal.\"\n\nSTORY: Purzycki's business ties: Asset or liability?\n\nSTORY: Report floats Joe Biden for Clinton's secretary of state\n\nThe surcharge was guaranteed by state lawmakers for 21 years under legislation approved in 2011 and enacted in the middle of 2012.\n\nAnd that's not the only benefit used to get Bloom to locate in Delaware. Other incentives included:\n\nTwenty-five years of $1 a year rent from the University of Delaware's 1743 Holding LLC, to attract the company to its STAR Campus as its first tenant.\n\n$12 million, which could increase to as much as $16.5 million, from the Delaware Strategic Fund in exchange for job creation.\n\nDelaware Strategic Fund in exchange for job creation. Expedited permitting.\n\nThe hastily-passed 2011 legislation needed to designate fuel cells, which run on natural gas, as a renewable energy source.\n\nAnd, most recently, a pass from state environmental officials on the way the company handled spent fuel canisters at its power generation facility near New Castle. (In the last few days, state environmental officials have concluded the canisters really are hazardous waste and should be handled as such with state inspection, review and accounting by the company. The pollutant of concern is benzene, a known carcinogen.)\n\nThere were federal grants, too. Under program 1603 of the Recovery Act, Bloom subsidiary Diamond State Generation Partners LLC received $77 million in 2014 in lieu of a federal tax credit for their Delaware fuel cell facility.\n\nFive years later, the Bloom economic development deal has some Delaware lawmakers scratching their heads, questioning whether it was worth the return. Opponents of the deal argue the number of jobs Bloom created does not justify the benefits handed to them. But supporters, including Markell, argue that Bloom has created hundreds of high-wage, technical positions that Delaware would not have otherwise.\n\n\"For the people who have jobs, I'm glad they have jobs,\" said Sen. Gregory F. Lavelle, R- Sharpley, the senate minority whip. \"But it's a hell of an expensive lesson picking winners and losers, particularly when we don't feel we were given the whole story ... The Bloom project, as sold, is not what we got. It is more expensive by a factor of four or five. If I'd known that, I never would have voted for it.\"\n\nLavelle said he is especially disheartened by the increasing surcharge that Delmarva Power customers are paying to support the deal and the fact that the 900 promised jobs have not materialized.\n\nRealistic job goals?\n\nCurrently, Delmarva customers, on average, are paying an extra $5.55 per month to fund Bloom's business in Delaware. When the surcharge was initially imposed in July 2012, it only added 65 cents to customers' bills. The charges are based on a calculation that includes three separate components. But charges went up as Bloom increased the number of fuel cells.\n\nLavelle is not the only one who regrets his Bloom vote. Rep. John Kowalko Jr., D-Newark South, represents the district where Bloom's manufacturing facility is located. Looking back on the deal, Kowalko said he wishes he raised more questions.\n\n\"This deal is an economic disaster,\" Kowalko said. \"It was a failure by the Legislature, including myself, to question the legislation as we should have. It was a rush to have it done in the waning days of the Senate, and that has historically been used as a method where we end up with really bad legislation, including Bloom.\"\n\nDemocrat Sen. Harris B. McDowell III, D-Wilmington North, did not sign the 2011 legislation. At first glance, Bloom's fuel cell sales to high-profile businesses like Microsoft and Adobe seemed impressive, he said. But his enthusiasm soon gave way to serious misgivings.\n\n\"When I analyzed the marketing of Bloom's products in California, there was not a cost-benefit calculation that made sense,\" McDowell recalled. \"Those companies weren't buying fuel cells on the basis of environmental value; they were buying for the public relations value. The companies wanted to be able to say they were as green as they could get, but they didn't monitor the energy savings.\"\n\nSen. David Lawson, R- Marydel, and fellow Republican and gubernatorial candidate Colin Bonini, Dover South, were the two senators who voted against the Bloom bill in 2011.\n\nLawson says he isn't an \"I told you so\" kind of guy. But he said recently, \"I was very skeptical. I still am. I don't think they are going to meet the deadline at the end of the month\" for promised job creation.\n\nOn Friday, Bloom reported to the Delaware Economic Development Office that, as of Sept. 30, it had created 277 jobs in Delaware, earning a total of $45 million. While that represents a 23 percent improvement over the 224 Delaware workers it had last year, it is far below the goal of 900 workers earning a combined $108 million Bloom promised it would bring to Delaware by October 2017.\n\nLawson said he questioned both the legislation – which he described as more of a contract between the state, Bloom and Delmarva Power, than a law – and Bloom's ability to deliver on the promised jobs.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, he said, \"I asked them how many years they had been in business in California.\"\n\nHe learned that over 11 years there, the company hadn't created 900 jobs there, he said.\n\n\"You're projecting some phenomenal growth,\" he recalled saying at the time. \"It turned out my suspicions have been verified. Everything was an emergency. We had to get it done now. … The ratepayers are stuck with this 21-year plan. … We're not getting any benefit from this.\"\n\nSen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View, who, at the time was in the House, called the Bloom bill \"a pig in a poke.\"\n\n\"We did not know what we were getting,\" he said. \"It cost us jobs. It cost us industry.\"\n\nWith higher utility costs, it makes the cost of doing business more expensive than in other states, he said.\n\n\"I thought this was a terrible deal … and the deal goes on.\"\n\nBonini agreed the Legislature wasn't given the complete story in 2011.\n\n\"I believe the Governor's Office and the General Assembly believed the hype about 900 jobs,\" he said. \"It was a good story, but it turned out not be a good deal.\"\n\nIf elected governor, Bonini said, he will make renegotiating the Bloom deal one of his top priorities.\n\n\"Bloom is one of the reasons our utility costs are out of whack,\" he said. \"We need to fix that or businesses aren't going to grow or come here. There is no question businesses don't look at Delaware because of utility costs.\"\n\nHis Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. John Carney, isn't critical of the deal, suggesting that at the time the state was coming off a serious economic downturn.\n\n\"The question is, how committed are you to creating good manufacturing jobs?\" he said. \"At the time, it looked like a pretty good deal.\"\n\nAs governor, he said, he would strive for balance between environmental good and job creation.\n\nSome still support the deal.\n\n\"I'm still very positive about Bloom,\" said Sen. Brian Bushweller, D-Dover/Central Kent. \"Basically, I'm happy with the way it's working out.\"\n\nEven McDowell said the final chapter of Bloom's Delaware story has yet to be written.\n\n\"I think school is out on whether or not we did a good thing,\" he said.\n\nMarkell remains bullish on Bloom's future. Earlier this month, the company announced a deal with Southern Company, one of the largest utilities in the United States. Under the agreement, Southern Company will buy 50-megawatt fuel cells from Bloom.\n\n\"I would love to see Bloom employ more people, but they are bringing hundreds of skilled and good wage jobs to Delaware,\" Markell said. \"The business continues to grow with a fantastic set of customers. The future looks strong.\"\n\nThe governor also cautioned against judging the Bloom deal without looking at Delaware's overall record on job creation, which he says is stronger than other states in the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\"People may focus on one particular thing, but when they look at all the strategic fund companies, those companies have generated more jobs than they had committed to in totality,\" he said. \"I would urge people to look at all this as a total package.\"\n\nThe heart of the deal\n\nAs Carney suggested, consider the economic climate in 2010 and 2011. The ill-fated Fisker deal to repurpose the old General Motors Boxwood Road plant with a new automaker was falling apart.\n\nIn December 2010, the unemployment rate in the state was at 8 percent. Thousands were unemployed or underemployed, and some of the state's biggest employers were cutting back through buyouts and layoffs.\n\nOn the environmental side, the much heralded Bluewater Wind project, a proposal to build a wind farm in the Atlantic Ocean off the Delaware coast, had fallen apart amid financial uncertainties such as the availability of grants and tax credits.\n\nCollin O'Mara, then the state's DNREC secretary and now chief executive officer of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, made a trip to California's Silicon Valley, where he met with Bloom executives and engineered a pitch for Delaware. O'Mara had been San Jose's Clean Tech Strategist before coming to Delaware.\n\nIn early June 2011, Markell's office announced the Bloom Energy deal and said the project could create up to 1,500 high-tech jobs between the company and its suppliers at the site of the former Chrysler factory in Newark. They name-dropped some of Bloom's customers: Google, FedEx, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart.\n\nAlan Levin ran the Delaware Economic Development Office at the time. He, along with Markell, O'Mara, McDowell and current DEDO director Bernice Whaley toured Bloom headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. He said Bloom was an opportunity to get on the ground floor of a cutting-edge technology.\n\n“Some of the world's largest companies have chosen Bloom Energy to power their growth, and now Bloom has chosen Delaware as the best site for their expansion,“ Markell said at the time.\n\nManufacturing jobs were disappearing, and pressure was on to bring jobs to Delaware.\n\nSTORY: Battle of the outsiders in New Castle County politics\n\nSTORY:Prime Hook Beach Road gets new bridge\n\nKowalko said that when he asked O'Mara questions about Bloom, the DNREC secretary responded by asking if the senator really wanted to take a hard stance against the deal after his district lost so many jobs when the Chrysler plant was shuttered.\n\n\"We were hemorrhaging jobs at that time,\" Kowalko said. \"There was an anxiousness and anxiety to bring good news to Delaware. No one wanted to turn their back on 900 jobs.\"\n\nEdward C. Ratledge, director of the University of Delaware Center for Applied Demography and Survey Research, said the Great Recession, from 2008 to 2014, hit Delaware hard.\n\nRatledge and William W. Boyer, Charles Polk Messick Professor Emeritus of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Delaware, looked at the state's response and recently published a book about it, \"Growing Business in Delaware: The Politics of Job Creation in a Small State.\"\n\nRatledge said with all the job losses there was \"pressure on the governor to do something.\"\n\nThe Bloom deal was complicated and it revolved around renewable energy credits.\n\nBefore 2011, there were two ways a company like Delmarva Power could satisfy its renewable energy requirements. They could deliver energy produced by an eligible source like wind or solar, or they could buy renewable energy credits. The Delaware Electric Cooperative, for instance, built a large solar plant near Georgetown to grow the company's renewable portfolio. Delmarva, meanwhile, was buying renewable energy credits from producers outside the state.\n\nThe game-changer came in 2011 when the Legislature created a special category classifying a qualified fuel cell – like those Bloom manufactures – as a renewable energy source. The catch was it only applied to fuel cells manufactured in Delaware.\n\nWhen O'Mara testified at a public hearing before the state Public Service Commission, he said Delaware was not the only state to certify fuel cells as a renewable energy resource. He said eight other states had taken similar steps.\n\nWhile Bloom Fuel Cells, or Bloom Boxes, can run off renewables such as the methane gas that comes from landfilling trash – in Delaware they are powered by natural gas.\n\nWithout the change in the law, Delmarva couldn't get the renewable energy credits, Ratledge said.\n\nRELATED: Bloom's benzene waste concerned EPA\n\nNew Castle County activist Victor Singer said he laughed out loud when asked whether the Bloom Boxes used in Delaware were powered with a renewable energy resource.\n\n\"I thought it was absurd to begin with,\" he said. \"The governor's philosophy appears to be anything that creates a job is worth doing.\"\n\nRatledge called Bloom's agreement with the state \"a sweetheart deal.\"\n\nIn the jobs report, Bloom Chief Financial Officer Randy Furr blamed the anemic growth on policy uncertainty that is impacting its \"ability to plan for further growth.\" Furr said at the end of last year, an investment tax credit was extended for solar customers, but that same credit was not extended those who purchased fuel cells.\n\nFurr wrote that if Bloom does not hit its 2017 wage and hiring targets, the company will return some of the strategic grant money.\n\n\"Bloom will abide by our agreements and will return the specified grant funds to DEDO to repurpose as the state deems appropriate,\" Furr wrote. \"We remain singularly focused on sustainability while reiterating our commitment to the State of Delaware.\"\n\nIt is hard to know how much of the potential $16.5 million the company could receive that could be returned to the state. The clawback provisions are based on the percentage of salary targets Bloom hits. For example, if Bloom reaches two-thirds of the $108 million, it will have to refund a different percentage of the amount than if it only creates jobs amounting to one-third of that amount.\n\nMarkell said the state will ensure Bloom returns what is required of them if they fail to meet their goals.\n\n\"If they have not met their targets next year, I full expect them to pay what they are supposed to pay,\" he said.\n\nRatledge said the jobs aren't the only issue.\n\n\"They underestimated how much they were going to burn in natural gas,\" he said. And \"there was no discussion on the spent sulfur capture.\"\n\nAs for state regulators \"they were not as careful as they should have been\" during the permitting and review process, he said.\n\nFast-tracked permits\n\nBloom applied for a Coastal Zone Permit in November of 2011. The state held a public hearing in March 2012 and the permit was issued the following month.\n\nThat sounded pretty speedy to Gerard Esposito, president of Tidewater Utilities based in Dover. Tidewater applied for a Coastal Zone permit for a wastewater treatment facility west of Rehoboth Bay. The review process took so long, he said, the project died before it could get started.\n\nState environmental chief David Small said the Bloom project wasn't extraordinary. He pointed to four other recent projects that went through the Coastal Zone approval process even faster than Bloom.\n\nThree people raised questions at Bloom's Coastal Zone hearing. Among them was Middletown resident John Nichols. Since that hearing, Nichols has gone to court to challenge the Bloom project both for the environmental permit process and the decision by the state public service commission to approve the rate surcharge. His cases have been dismissed for lack of standing.\n\nNichols said he continues to question the Bloom deal.\n\n“Bloom is expensive, and it’s dirty,” he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Bloom confidentially filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, according to media reports.\n\nMatt Ross, a spokesman for Bloom, declined to comment on whether the filing is for an IPO.\n\n\"Our focus continues to be on what is important, which is creating a strong company focused on sustainable and long-term growth,\" he said.\n\nThe filing is confidential because of a 2012 law permitting companies with under $1 billion in revenue to quietly file proposed IPO documents with the SEC. Companies typically use the rule to gauge investor interest before going public.\n\nRumors that Bloom would go public have circulated for years, but the company never pulled the trigger. The confidential filing has some wondering why the company might be making a play for investor cash at this time.\n\nKathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based manager of IPO-focused Exchange Traded Funds, said the company's private backers have held their investment much longer than usual. Typically, a private investor cashes out after a few years, but some of Bloom's investors have maintained their investment for the company's entire 15-year lifespan.\n\nThat combined with what Smith described as a weak market for energy IPOs could lead to a situation where the public values the market below what the private investors paid for their share of Bloom.\n\n\"The longer these private investors hold these shares, there is going to be a lower rate of return on them if you look at the time value of money,\" Smith said.\n\nDavid Stevenson, director of the Cesar Rodney Institute's Center for Energy Competitiveness and a longtime Bloom critic, offers a different possibility for why the company could go public at this time. He says Bloom's government subsidies are drying up and they need to meet their debt obligations.\n\nIn late 2014, Bloom raised about $130 million in the form of convertible debt notes, according to an email to clients from Spruce Investment Advisors, a manager of funds that hold Bloom shares. The notes, which are essentially loans provided to investors, carry a term of three years. That means the loans would need to be repaid by December 2017.\n\nThe Spruce email says the notes would convert to preferred stock in the event of an IPO, \"assuming an initial offering price of at least $25.76 per share.\"\n\n\"Their backs are against the wall, and they are throwing a Hail Mary so they can stay viable,\" he said.\n\nSome of the subsidies outside of Delaware are starting to dry up. After winning nearly 75 percent of the available Connecticut contracts in 2013, no additional contracts have been announced. Ross said Bloom has continued to win contracts and deploy fuel cells in the state, but not all contracts have been publicly announced.\n\n\"We believe it is our customers' right to choose when and how they announce their projects,\" he said.\n\nIn June, California modified its $1.4 billion Self-Generation Incentive Program, which had doled out more than $400 million to Bloom. The company was said to be the single largest recipient of funds from the program.\n\nThe Golden State's legislature has begun tinkering with the program to possibly phase out the use of fuel cells and invest more in energy storage. It is also considering changing how the money gets disbursed.\n\n\"Without those California subsidies, Bloom doesn't have a business,\" Stevenson said.\n\nWill they stay?\n\nAs Bloom struggles to find footing in Delaware and animosity from Delmarva ratepayers grows, some wonder what will keep Bloom here after the surcharge expires.\n\nRoss said the company has no plans to vacate the state.\n\n\"The advanced fuel cell systems manufactured by Bloom Energy in Delaware are exported across the U.S. and to markets around the world, thanks to our highly-skilled team in Newark,\" he said. \"We have, to date, invested over $50 million in our Newark facility and are fully committed to continuing to build this new industry in Delaware, and to having the state and the entire region benefit from this growth.\"\n\nMarkell agreed with Ross. The governor said Bloom would not abandon the hundreds of manufacturing jobs it created and the state. He added that the company has become involved in community groups, including one of Markell's favorite programs, Pathways to Prosperity. The program prepares high school students with in-demand jobs skills by having them work at local companies, including Bloom.\n\nStevenson remains skeptical. Under Bloom's agreement with the state, they would have to refund Delmarva customers if they leave. The amount decreases every year Bloom remains. That clause was added to the Bloom contract by the Public Service Commission to better protect ratepayers. If Bloom left after a year, they would be required to pay $20 million. This year that number has dropped to $7.5 million, and it will fall to $3.5 million by 2021.\n\n\"I think the $7.5 million is enough to keep them here,\" Stevenson said. \"But after that, if another state offered them a deal there is no incentive to stay here.\"\n\nFor now, Delaware residents are eagerly awaiting next year's jobs report to learn whether Bloom met its hiring and wage targets or if taxpayers will get back at least some of their money. But that may be of little consolation to the Delmarva ratepayers seeing ever-increasing utility bills.\n\n\"Even if we repeal the fuel cell designation and clawback the money DEDO put out, that won't be a drop in the bucket compared to what the ratepayers have put out,\" Kowalko said.\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.

It has put financial pressure on consumers and political pressure the Biden administration to act accordingly to lower prices. As a result, the role America plays in the international oil market has become a top political issue.\n\n\"This small area has enough oil to fuel America for the next 200 years,\" reads a a July 12 Facebook post that was shared more than 1,400 times in three days. The image in the post shows a map of Texas and New Mexico with a part greyed out to indicate the boundary of the Permian Basin, the U.S.'s most productive oil region. Within that greyed out section, two dotted yellow lines outline the Delaware and Midland Basins.\n\nOther versions of the claim amassed thousands of additional shares on Facebook.\n\nEstimates of how much oil is in the Delaware and Midland Basins can vary, but experts told USA TODAY even if the highest estimate were true, it would not be enough to meet Americans' oil consumption needs for two centuries.\n\nU.S. Geological Survey assessments show those two basins contain about 66 billion barrels of oil, which equates to about nine years of America's oil consumption – not 200 years as the post claims.\n\nFollow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to users who shared the claim for comment.\n\nPermian Basin's oil would not last two centuries, according to agency estimates\n\nTed Kury, director of Energy Studies for the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida, said estimates of the amount of oil in the Permian Basin, and the U.S. overall, vary because of different calculation models.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey in 2018 announced that the Delaware Basin contains an estimated mean of more than 46 billion barrels of continuous oil. And in 2016, the agency estimated the Midland Basin to contain a mean of about 20 billion barrels of continuous oil, totaling around 66 billion barrels.\n\nAlbuquerque-based KRQE News reported that Ryan Flynn, the executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association at the time, said the 2018 announcement meant the state could \"meet the energy needs of the entire U.S. for decades to come.\"\n\nKury said that number \"certainly doesn't agree\" with all oil supply figures. He cited a January report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration that said proved reserves of U.S. crude oil and lease condensate were at 38.2 billion barrels at the end of 2020. This includes reserves across the country, not just the Permian Basin.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, proved reserves are measurements \"geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.”\n\nAs a result, proved reserve estimates can change due to the production of existing reserves, changes in prices and new technologies, according to the agency. This explains the disparity between the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey estimates, which measure continuous oil \"regardless of any economic or accessibility considerations,\" its website explains.\n\nNo matter how much oil is actually in the Permian Basin, Kury said it wouldn't necessarily reflect how much oil would or could be accessed.\n\n\"It may be in order to get to some of that oil we're going to need technologies we don't even have yet,\" he said. \"Just because it's down there doesn't mean we can physically extract it.\"\n\nMore: USGS: Largest oil deposit ever found in U.S. discovered in Texas\n\nAnd even if physical extraction were possible, Kury said it might not be economically viable to do so.\n\nHugh Daigle, an associate professor at The University of Texas at Austin's department of petroleum and geosystems engineering, cited the U.S. EIA report that the U.S. consumed an average of nearly 20 million barrels of petroleum per day in 2021, which equates to more than 7.2 billion barrels during the year.\n\nHe said if Americans' rate of oil consumption remained the same, the country would need almost 1.5 trillion barrels of oil in a 200-year time span.\n\n\"None of the numbers I've seen in the Permian Basin come close to that,\" Daigle said.\n\nUsing U.S. Energy Information Administration data on proved reserves in the U.S., Daigle estimated the Permian Basin contains about 15 billion barrels of crude oil.\n\nEven if the 66 billion figure – the highest estimate of continuous oil in the Midland and Delaware Basins – were accurate and accessible, it would only be enough to meet Americans' current oil consumption for about nine years.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin have enough oil to fuel America for 200 years. Assessments from the U.S. Geological Survey estimate the areas in question contain about 66 billion barrels – the amount of oil Americans consume in about nine years.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Of that travel, 82% will be done by car, but most of it will be carpooling to save money.

U.S. crude oil costs $112.88 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, costs $116.41 as of Thursday, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nGas prices have begun to level off this week, but Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told USA TODAY things can change at the pump. Prices typically rise in the summer, and Memorial Day is the \"unofficial kickoff to the summer driving season,\" De Haan said.\n\nThe demand for gas and hurricane season, which begins on June 1 and is expected to bring several storms this year, can result in higher prices.\n\n\"We're probably setting up for a bumpy and expensive ride at the pump in the summer. It undoubtedly in my mind, barring a recession, is going to be the priciest summer that we've ever seen,\" De Haan said.\n\nWhen should I get gas?\n\n\"Sooner rather than later,\" De Haan said.\n\nHe added the reason is that although increases are slowing down, they could rise up toward the end of the week and when people begin to hit the road. But prices may be dipping in some cities and counties, so it's best to monitor daily changes.\n\nDe Haan said gas stations would also be busier as the weekend approaches, so not only could you be paying for more gas, but you could be spending more time waiting to do so.\n\nThose traveling across states should also see if there are any price differences across state lines. For instance, the average price in Nevada is $5.24, but go east to Utah and it's $4.59.\n\nAnother tip from De Haan to save money? Slow down about 5-10 mph on the highway.\n\n\"You can generally boost your fuel efficiency by 5% to 10%, if not more, and with a national average of $4.50, even a 10% savings is the equivalent of close to 50 cents a gallon,\" he said.\n\nWhere is gas the most expensive?\n\nThe West Coast is where you'll find the most expensive gas in the U.S., as all states bordering the Pacific Ocean are averaging over $6..

prices: How much will gas cost? When should I get ...", "text": "Fourth of July travelers will have some relief at the pump, although gas prices are still at levels never before seen for the holiday weekend.\n\nThe national average for a gallon of gas is $4.86, according to AAA. That is 26 cents more than Memorial Day weekend prices, but it reflects a decline in prices in recent weeks. Gas prices peaked when the all-time record, not adjusted for inflation, was reached June 14 at $5.01 a gallon.\n\nThe drop in prices comes as a record number of Americans are expected to take road trips for July Fourth weekend. But high prices are still a concern for some travelers: 50% of respondents surveyed by the travel planning site The Vacationer said gas prices affected their holiday travel plans.\n\nPatrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said people may be excited about the decline in gas prices, but it might not last long.\n\n\"Little bouts of relief here and there are going to be common this summer, but we may not also be done with the fireworks yet,\" De Haan told USA TODAY.\n\nHere's what you should know about gas prices for Fourth of July weekend:\n\nTraveling for July Fourth? Here are 5 things to know before flying, driving this weekend.\n\nJuly Fourth weekend travel: Here are the best and worst times to leave for your road trip\n\nWhy are gas prices going down? How long will it last?\n\nDe Haan listed several factors for why gas prices are dropping, notably the fears of a global economy in decline resulting in oil prices falling. But oil prices have begun to rise: U.S. crude oil hit $113.66 a barrel, while the international standard Brent crude costs $122.21, both reflecting 2% price increases on Wednesday, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"As we go into the July for weekend, it's possible that prices could bottom out at some point next week, and they may inch up a little bit, just depending on what happens between now and then,\" he said. \"It's been very difficult to predict beyond a week or two.\"\n\nAside from the rise in the demand for gas this summer, another factor that could contribute to another increase in prices is the beginning of hurricane season, because offshore refineries could be hit by storms.\n\nWhen should I get gas for July Fourth travel?\n\nLater is actually better, De Haan said.\n\nHe expects demand to be high on Thursday and Friday but not for Saturday to Monday. Plus, prices are likely to drop.\n\n\"Don't be in a rush to fill up before you leave. Don't go fill up the tank tomorrow night if you're leaving Friday; wait until Friday, because there should be some relief that continues up to and through the holiday weekend,\" De Haan said.\n\nAnother way people could save up on gas is drive 5 to 10 mph slower to increase fuel efficiency. De Haan said people who are traveling to other states should take that into consideration when getting gas, because some states have prices that are dramatically lower.\n\nFor example, gas costs at least $7.19 a gallon in Needles, California, but just 2 miles north of the California-Arizona border, you can get gas around $4.75 in Mohave Valley, Arizona.\n\nQuestion, answered: Is using a phone while pumping gas actually dangerous?\n\nWhere is gas the most expensive?\n\nThe West Coast is where you'll find the most expensive gas; California leads the way at $6.29 a gallon.\n\nWhere is gas the least expensive?\n\nThe Southeast is the best place to get gas, with seven states under $4.50 a gallon. The state with the cheapest gas is Georgia at $4.37.\n\nAverage gas prices per state\n\nWondering how much gas costs in your state or any state you are traveling to for July Fourth?

pays more ...", "text": "Four years after new President Dennis Assanis and athletic director Chrissi Rawak pledged to make University of Delaware sports teams bigger winners, UD’s financial investment in athletics is among the national front-runners while Blue Hen teams often remain Colonial Athletic Association also-rans.\n\nDelaware’s expenditures on athletics are second-highest among schools in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision, data analysis reveals.\n\nOnly conference rival James Madison spends more, according to the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics’ financial information database.\n\nJames Madison has won a league-high 17 conference championships the last four years, 10 more than Delaware.\n\nFurthermore, when looking at all NCAA Division I schools, including those in the highest level, the Football Bowl Subdivision, Delaware ranks 70th nationally in operating expenses and fourth in terms of how much of its athletic support is drawn from institutional/government resources. That’s among 230 public schools in statistics compiled by USA Today.\n\nLittle Delaware isn’t such a lightweight, apparently, when it comes to splurging on sports in a bid to become more relevant in its conference and even nationally. Delaware allocates a greater amount of university-derived money toward athletics than most schools.\n\nBlue Hens teams did begin to turn the corner in 2019-20, logging a 147-99-4 record before the coronavirus pandemic forced a premature end to winter and spring athletics in March.\n\nCLASSES TO RESUME: UD announces fall semester plans, changes\n\nThe $38.23 million in athletic funding that came directly from the institution in 2017-18, the most recent school year for which information is available, was considerably more than any of Delaware’s FCS counterparts, according to the Knight Commission.\n\nNext, were conference football rivals Rhode Island ($20.48 million) and Stony Brook ($17.22 million).\n\n“They stand out because there was an investment,” Rawak said of those financial figures. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with that, especially if we are producing.\"\n\nBut is that investment too significant?\n\nOnly one FBS athletic program received more in government/institutional support – the United States Air Force Academy ($39.8 million), according to the Knight Commission's 2017-18 data.\n\nThe subject came up last fall at a UD board of trustees’ committee on student life and athletics summit. Meeting minutes describe “a robust discussion” on the topic of spending “finite” resources on athletics and concerns about “the potential return” on the investment.\n\nIt was initiated by Matt Robinson, head of the UD sport management program who had been the interim athletic director in the first half of 2016 before Rawak’s hiring. Robinson had raised concerns about the university’s considerable subsidization of athletics with Rawak during the meeting.\n\nWhile acknowledging the discussion took place, Robinson, who is also UD Faculty Senate president, preferred not to comment further on the topic when recently asked by Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nAssanis had responded to Robinson’s concerns by expressing that he and other university presidents share the wish “to elevate their institutions through success in athletics,” meeting minutes reported.\n\nSurely, sports accomplishments are attention-getters that can fuel enrollment and fund-raising, though UD’s strong academic reputation and picturesque campus have long been powerful lures in their own right.\n\nRawak described athletics as “a window to the broader public” that could “drive the success of the entire university,” according to board of trustees meeting minutes.\n\nBut college athletics is also a costly venture.\n\nDivision I schools away from the Power Five bloc, which includes the Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, SEC and Pac-12 with their lucrative TV packages and wealthy donors, have a particularly difficult time finding outside funding sources.\n\nALL IN: CAA announces all teams will qualify for postseason tournaments\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has cast additional light on those high costs and athletic spending often viewed as frivolous, such as coaches’ salaries, staffing, scheduling and travel, especially from far-flung conference alignment. It has forced many to rethink their approaches and ensure spending is efficient and frugal.\n\nIn April, UD announced the pandemic had left it with a $65 million overall budget shortfall because of the switch to online learning after students were sent home and all university events were canceled in mid-March.\n\nAthletic financial losses were not severe but certainly impactful, Rawak suggested. The only cuts announced so far affecting athletics have been some part-time positions. Staff development, travel and scheduling are areas where budgets will be trimmed, Rawak said.\n\nThe basketball teams staying overnight at hotels before games at nearby Drexel and Towson and the football team sleeping in a hotel the night before home games are potential cost-cutting targets. This fall, the soccer, volleyball and field hockey teams are playing fewer games that involve significantly less travel.\n\n\"We're in a different time now,\" Rawak said of COVID-19's impact on college athletics and the need to adjust.\n\nA slew of Division I schools have recently dropped sports: Old Dominion (wrestling); Cincinnati (men’s soccer); Furman (baseball and men’s lacrosse); Central Michigan (men’s track and field); Akron (men’s cross country, men’s golf, women’s tennis); East Carolina (men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s swimming); Florida International (men’s indoor track); Appalachian State (men’s soccer, men’s indoor and outdoor track and men’s tennis); Wright State (men’s and women’s tennis and softball); Connecticut (men's cross country, swimming and tennis and women's rowing); and Brown (11 sports). Before those cuts, Brown's 38 teams were more than any school nationally except Harvard and Stanford.\n\nExcept for FCS-level Furman and Brown and non-football playing Wright State, all are FBS schools in Group of Five conferences. Commissioners from that collection of leagues, which do not reap the economic windfall of Power Five schools, recently requested a reduction in the NCAA requirement that they field a minimum of 16 teams. The NCAA Division I Council denied it.\n\nDelaware, which fields 21 athletic teams, had $44.32 million in athletic funding and expenses in the most recent 2017-18 fiscal review, according to the Knight Commission, including that $38.23 million in university backing. The $44.32 million was the figure that ranked 70th nationally in USA Today’s accounting.\n\nBy contrast, 34 football-playing schools from the FBS Mid-American Conference, Conference USA and Sun Belt Conference – all in that Group of Five – had lower operating expenses on athletics than Delaware, including sport-killers Central Michigan, Akron, FIU and Appalachian State.\n\nFBS schools may award 85 football scholarships compared with 63 for FCS schools such as Delaware, a significant additional expense.\n\nRawak, however, dismissed the Knight Commission math, claiming it gives a false impression that, she said, makes Delaware stand out more than it should in relation to its Division I peers.\n\nFor example, she said, sports medicine operates out of the Carpenter Center and is counted as part of the funding supporting athletics but is actually overseen by UD Student Health.\n\nShe also said some schools do not count the significant cost of athletic facility groundskeeping, as Delaware does, in figures given to the Knight Commission.\n\n“How everybody counts money is very different,” she said, including scholarships in those accounting variances. “It creates more questions.”\n\nThe Knight Commission, founded in 1989, is a panel of experts in education and athletics that aims to ensure college sports function within the academic framework of the institutions. The Collegiate Athletics Financial Information Database aims to improve the accountability of public Division I institutions by making their spending and earning more transparent.\n\nDREAM COMES TRUE: UD pitcher Sullivan signs with Phillies\n\n“I would guarantee you there are a lot of universities that are supported the way we are but they don’t count it so it’s not an accurate interpretation,” Rawak said, adding that includes fellow Colonial Athletic Association members.\n\nIn an email response to questions, Amy Perko, the Knight Commission’s chief executive officer, wrote that “the NCAA has made changes over the years to improve definitions and comparability but there may continue to be differences in how institutions report the data.\"\n\n\"That said,\" she added, \"these audited reports represent the most accurate athletics financial reports available and the data are used by the NCAA to produce ‘dashboard metrics’ that institutional leaders use to assess their athletic programs’ financial health. These institutional data are rarely seen by the public.”\n\nThe Knight Commission employs financial data that schools are required to submit to the NCAA that is “subject to agreed-upon procedures performed by a qualified independent accountant,” according to the commission, and approved by university presidents or chancellors.\n\nPerko added that “the Knight Commission has always believed that – at their best – intercollegiate sports provide important educational opportunities for college athletes and benefits for the entire university community. We also believe that more effective disclosure of finances – and of financial priorities – will enhance the long-term prospects of college sports by ensuring they remain part of, not apart from, the core mission of universities.’’\n\nMajor increase in athletic spending\n\nWhatever differences there may be between how schools do their accounting, there is no doubt Delaware has seen a huge increase in athletic expenditures and university support since Assanis and Rawak appeared in the spring of 2016.\n\nFor the 2015-16 school year, the last before they arrived, Delaware had $34.31 million in athletics funding, with $28.05 million, or 82%, coming from UD coffers.\n\nIn just two years, Delaware’s annual spending on athletics increased $10 million, all provided by the university.\n\n“I was looking for the best person to take the athletics program here to the next level,” Assanis said when Rawak was hired. “ ... The first thing we need to be is the best within the [Colonial Athletic Association].”\n\nRawak, who came to Delaware from the University of Michigan, was determined to build a stronger foundation upon which championship seasons could be constructed. Assanis provided the financial resources, with the board of trustees’ support.\n\n“If you were to look at each of the different programs and how they’ve achieved, my answer would be ‘Yes,’” Rawak said when asked if Delaware was making good on that investment. “They’re all in different places.”\n\nBLUE HENS BACK: First group returns to use athletic facilities\n\nIn that board of trustees' committee on student life and athletics meeting, Rawak described her intentions to make Delaware a “Cinderella story” in college athletics, suggesting the Blue Hens had to rise from wretched depths to reach championship heights. It’s why her strategic plan for athletics is titled “Project Glass Slipper.”\n\nIn actuality, Delaware seems miscast for that role.\n\nThe Blue Hens have hardly been viewed by collegiate counterparts as forlorn or deserving pity despite the ups and downs of their teams, making the rags-to-riches fairy-tale comparison suspect. Delaware has often been held in high regard by sporting peers, though many would agree that its teams could fare better overall in the conference.\n\nIn the few years before Rawak came, UD women’s basketball teams, thanks to Elena Delle Donne’s presence, went to the 2012 and 2013 NCAA tournaments. Their male counterparts followed in 2014.\n\nMen’s soccer, having not reached NCAA play since 1970, made the 2011 and 2013 NCAA brackets. Field hockey began its run of CAA titles and NCAA berths in 2013. Women’s track won the 2014 CAA title.\n\nBefore that, the football team reached national title games in 2003, 2007 and 2010, winning the first. Men’s lacrosse was in four NCAA tournaments from 2005-11, including a Final Four appearance in 2007; and volleyball made four NCAA trips from 2007-11.\n\nBut to enhance its championship chances, Delaware has spent more.\n\n\"It's allowing us to do something really special here for what I believe is a really special place and has the ability to achieve,\" Rawak said.\n\nOLYMPIC STAND RESONATES: Smith's, Carlos' 1968 protest still goes unheeded\n\nJMU, which has five fewer teams and 100 fewer athletes than Delaware, had $51.72 million in funding for 2017-18 with $41.7 million from institutional/government sources, most from mandatory fees imposed on students.\n\nThe USA Today data reveals FBS members Air Force Academy ($40.2 million) and Connecticut ($39 million) as the only others allocating more university-derived funds for athletics than Delaware.\n\nDelaware receives 86.25% of its athletic funding from the university, ranking it ninth among the 230 Division I schools in the USA Today compilation. Among the eight ahead of Delaware was CAA rival Towson (87.17%).\n\nThough it comes under the heading of “institutional/government support,” UD officials insist the university, not state taxpayers, provides the economic sustenance for Blue Hens sports. The Senate Joint Finance Committee approved $125 million in 2020-21 annual funding for UD on June 5.\n\nState Rep. John Kowalko, whose 25th district includes UD's campus, doubts the contention that taxpayer dollars are not being used to support athletics.\n\n“I’m saying, ‘Prove it,’” Kowalko said. “That money could be intermingled dramatically. … Until they agree they are willing to support the repeal of their FOIA, so I can look at these numbers, I don’t believe them.”\n\nKowalko was referring to the University of Delaware being exempt from state records laws, including most Freedom of Information Act requests. That means the university does not need to provide the public with details of its accounting.\n\n“I believe that they are co-mingling taxpayer money,” Kowalko added, suggesting some operational dollars from the state likely do support athletics. “It’s the same pot of soup.”\n\nIn response to a FOIA request submitted by The News Journal seeking more data on athletic funding, UD's associate vice president and deputy general counsel, Jennifer M. Becnel-Guzzo, wrote the “athletic department is not supported with public funds. Therefore, the university has no public records responsive to your request.”\n\nWhile one UD athletic official did compare Delaware’s institutional funding to those required student fees charged at JMU and many other schools, such as UConn, Rawak said that is not correct.\n\nShe said athletic funding comes from general university resources that are drawn from various reserves but that students and their families are “not paying for athletics.”\n\nDelaware also spent $11.77 million on athletic aid for its 600-plus student-athletes in 2017-18, according to the Knight Report. That’s roughly $20,000 per student-athlete.\n\nNEW APPROACH: COVID forces recruiting changes for Rocco\n\nUD’s $1.4 billion endowment does not pay for athletics and is presently not a viable source, Rawak said. But endowing components of athletics as a funding mechanism is a goal, she added.\n\nTuition and fees have typically risen about 4% annually for UD students, increasing $600 to $14,280 for in-state undergraduates in 2019-20 and $1,400 to $35,710 for their out-of-state counterparts.\n\n\"We don't use that to fund athletics,\" Rawak said, adding that the university has numerous income sources beyond student payments.\n\nSeveral UD faculty members not authorized to speak on behalf of the university or the athletic department, as well as those with knowledge of the subject outside the school, disputed Rawak's contention students are not helping to foot the bill for athletics, however.\n\nDavid Ridpath, an Ohio University sports management professor, agrees that “athletic programs at colleges and universities have value.” He is president of the board of directors for the Drake Group, which has a mission “to defend academic integrity in higher education from the corrosive aspects of commercialized college sports.”\n\n“But that value is often overstated and used as an excuse to spend more,” he told The News Journal, “such as when apologists claim that athletic success influences enrollment, donations, etc. when the evidence on that is mixed at best.\n\n“So it becomes a perpetual cycle of trying to be something you are not, and chasing someone else who is likely spending money they don’t have. A school can have a successful athletic program without continuing to spend more and more where likely the end game is exactly the same as when they started.”\n\nChanging to spur success\n\nPart of Rawak’s efforts to improve UD athletic fortunes has included changing head coaches in 12 of Delaware’s 21 varsity sports.\n\nThe seven conference titles Delaware has won since Rawak came – three in field hockey (2016, 2017 and 2019) and one each in men’s soccer (2016), baseball (2017), women’s golf (2017) and women’s outdoor track and field (2019) – were all by teams with head coaches who were here before Rawak’s arrival.\n\nIn 2016, Delaware also won the NCAA field hockey title.\n\n“If you were to look at the successes of our programs, collectively, all of them, one of the things to recognize is, Rome wasn’t built in a day,” said Rawak, who is frequently lauded by staff for her positive approach and leadership. “It takes time.\"\n\nThe 2019-20 school year was, by far, Delaware’s most successful recently from a won-loss standpoint before the shutdown.\n\nThe previous three, Blue Hen squads went 189-188-2 in 2016-17, 170-184-6 in 2017-18 and 162-200-3 last year. Along with that CAA women’s track title, the 2018-19 season did feature the return to the national rankings by the men’s lacrosse team.\n\nThe 147-99-4 record in 2019-20 was a dramatic improvement and likely reflected some new coaches reaping the benefits of their programs getting re-established.\n\nIn addition to more field hockey success, this school year featured a 22-11 record in men’s basketball, its best in six seasons; women’s soccer had its highest finish, second place, in 18 Colonial Athletic Association seasons and most wins (12) since 1994; women’s cross-country was a best-ever second in the CAA meet; men’s tennis was 14-1 with a chance at the winningest season in school history when it ended prematurely; softball was 19-4, equaling its best start ever, at the time spring sports were halted.\n\nOther sports, however, such as football – long the university’s pride and joy – and women’s basketball, struggled to regain past glories.\n\nLEARNING FROM LEGENDS: QBs enjoy video meetings with Blue Hen greats\n\nAfter ending a seven-year NCAA football playoff absence in 2018, Delaware went 5-7 last fall, its third under coach Danny Rocco. Despite a veteran lineup, women’s basketball was 12-17 under third-year coach Natasha Adair.\n\nAmong recent athletic upgrades at Delaware have been devoting more resources toward sports such as swimming, tennis, golf, cross-country and track, which were once designated as “low-tier.” Tennis players often supplied their own rackets, and runners received just one pair of shoes for a season.\n\nMuch of Rawak’s approach has gone toward adding staff positions aimed at supporting the athletic mission, such as in heath-, media-, academic- and leadership-related positions.\n\nIn 2015-16, Delaware spent $3.65 million on support and administrative compensation, according to the Knight Commission. Two years later, that figure had nearly doubled to $6.8 million.\n\nThe UD staff directory on BlueHens.com recently listed 219 positions, including 14 involved with recreation programs and intramural activities at Carpenter Sports Building on central campus.\n\nIn contrast, several FBS schools that are close to Delaware in terms of spending list far fewer, such as Conference USA’s Old Dominion (166), Mountain West member Wyoming (186) and the MAC’s Buffalo (193).\n\nThe University of Delaware does not reveal salaries of its coaches or athletic administrators, even though some are among the First State’s highest-paid employees.\n\nIn doing so, UD cites its status as a state-assisted yet privately chartered and governed institution. Taxpayer dollars do typically account for roughly 10% of the university’s annual operating budget.\n\nThe university's IRS Form 990, which is made public, does list the highest compensated employees.\n\nIt is known that Rocco was the third-highest paid UD employee in 2017, according to the most recently available IRS Form 990, with total compensation of $609,167. Rawak ranked seventh at $480,046.\n\nBoth have taken 5% pay cuts, along with Adair and men’s basketball coach Martin Ingelsby, as part of COVID-19 money-saving measures.\n\nRidpath, the Ohio University professor, termed Delaware’s institutional and government support “a significant amount of money that could have been used for other things to support the educational mission, but Delaware made a choice.”\n\nBut was it the right choice?\n\n“For Delaware, that is pretty high of an amount,” Ridpath said. “There are many disadvantages, not the least of which is aptly explained as robbing Peter to pay Paul. I don’t think some funding like this is inherently bad but this amount is too much considering where the money is coming from.\n\n“... The real danger is schools like Delaware that don’t generate enough revenue [income] still increasing spending. The question is why and how that impacts university?”\n\nNew financial sources surface\n\nThe huge financial impact athletics has on a college is not new.\n\nIn his 1918 tome “The Higher Learning in America,” economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote: “College sports come in for ever increasing attention and take an increasingly prominent and voluminous place in the university’s life.”\n\nHe warned collegiate athletics was “earnestly pushed by the businesslike authorities” even though, he added, “it is the most widely out of touch with all learning.”\n\nThese are modern-day arguments as well, though UD athletes tend to perform better academically than their counterparts. Ten teams had perfect scores in 2018-19 in the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate, which measures academic eligibility and retention of scholarship athletes over a four-year period.\n\nIn the introduction to his 2019 book, Intercollegiate Athletics Inc., George Mason University economics and public policy professor James T. Bennett wrote that collegiate athletic programs have become “gargantuan, taxpayer-supported spectacles that now dominate many public universities.”\n\nOf Delaware pulling so much of its athletic revenue from institutional sources, Bennett said, “That’s not revenue at all. Revenues come from ticket sales and paraphernalia sales. This isn’t revenue.”\n\nIt’s actually a subsidy that’s granted, in this case, by the university.\n\n“The whole thing is a scam, very candidly,” Bennett said. “I mean, what’s the purpose of the university? I thought it was education.”\n\n“Highest-paid guy is some loser coach,” added Bennett, who was speaking generally not specifically about anyone at Delaware. “What does it say about priorities? Spending tens of million dollars on programs with zero academic value. This is unheard of throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Think of how you could divert that money.”\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION: Howard starter Prince transfers to Delaware\n\nDelaware has shown the potential to tap into other monetary resources, however.\n\nOne of Delaware’s biggest victories off the field in recent years, for all to see, did come in fundraising, though there was a substantial cost to the university as well.\n\nIn a campaign separate from normal athletic support involving capital funds, UD contributed $25 million toward the $60 million project to refurbish the west grandstand of Delaware Stadium and build the adjoining Whitney Athletic Center.\n\nThe other $35 million was raised through private donations, including a $10 million gift from 1980 graduate and former UD golf team member Ken Whitney and his wife, Elizabeth. The nearly two-year project is slated to be concluded late this summer.\n\nThe easy transmission of the coronavirus between people, which has led to social-distancing standards, jeopardizes the immediate future of crowded assemblies and the financial rewards that come with them, however. Delaware has not yet announced how it will handle or limit football crowds this season.\n\nUD has other facility improvements it would like to tackle, including updating the east stands at Delaware Stadium and a complete modernization of the window-less Delaware Field House. The Delaware Stadium/Whitney Athletic Center project demonstrated there are potential outside financial resources for athletics.\n\n“The fundraising we did here,” Rawak said during a tour of Delaware Stadium, “was a significantly positive sign that people believe in the vision and are invested in it.\"\n\nOfficials also visualize Delaware Stadium as a greater potential revenue generator by using it as a site for large-scale events, much the way the Carpenter Center is a setting for concerts, graduations and other gatherings beyond UD games. Placing a temporary public ice-skating rink inside Delaware Stadium in the winter, for instance, and even playing hockey games there has been proposed.\n\nThe athletic department received just $710,000 from donor contributions in 2017-18, below the FCS median, according to the Knight Commission (Donations for the Delaware Stadium/Whitney Center project count separately because they're for a capital project not athletic expenses).\n\nWith the exception of several Historically Black Colleges and Universities, most FCS schools had a larger percentage of their revenue from those sources than Delaware.\n\nIn marked contrast, perennial FCS football champ North Dakota State pulled in $6.7 million in donor contributions; CAA rival William & Mary, $5.8 million; Missouri State, $4.7 million; football power Montana State, $4.2 million; and JMU, $2.5 million.\n\nWith schools having to rein in athletic costs because of COVID-19’s impact, Delaware faces a stiff challenge in its continued effort to improve its sports fortunes while also being fiscally fit and tuned in to important social issues.\n\n“I don’t resent that fact that they are trying to make major sports programs prominent for this university,” Kowalko said, “but is it at the cost of academics? Is it at the cost of integrating the school when they talk about diversity?”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

She brought down a chair so she can read there.\n\nAnd, to avoid using her stove while upstairs, she makes sandwiches and warms up food in the microwave.\n\nMorris, 65, already had her power shut off in June – when the thermometer in the Chicago area hit at least 90 degrees on seven days – after falling behind on her payments. She was forced to use savings to settle the nearly $500 tab, which she can’t do again since she’s on a fixed income after retiring last year.\n\n“You can’t afford to turn your air on anymore. That’s very sad,” said Morris, who is also staying home more because of high gas prices. “Any other summers, I will turn my air on. But this summer, it’s just way too expensive.”\n\nHeat waves have impacted the vast majority of the US during the first half of the summer, forcing Americans to deal with sweltering conditions. More than 100 million people were under heat alerts on Tuesday.\n\nHigh-temperature spells have become more frequent and intense with each passing decade, and they last longer than they did before, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nBut many people have had to curtail their air conditioning usage to try to keep their electricity bills in check, as they also struggle with the spike in price for food, gas and other essentials.\n\nAmericans’ electric bills are expected to increase by 20% to an average of $540 for this summer, compared to the same period last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\nBut even if people limit their usage, they may still get bigger bills. That’s because residential electricity prices are rising at a faster pace this summer than in many previous years, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The increase is driven in part by the surge in cost of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity. Natural gas prices jumped following a production slump during the pandemic, as well as shortages due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nAir conditioning, however, is not merely for comfort. It’s a necessity for many people, particularly those in poor health. More than 700 people in the US die from heat-related causes every year, on average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deaths are generally considered preventable.\n\n“Extreme heat events are deadly, and they are increasingly frequent,” said Stephen Walls, a clean building advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Cooling assistance could help avoid hundreds of deaths per year.”\n\nLack of federal assistance\n\nBut there’s far less government aid available to help people afford to cool their homes, compared to heating them in the winter, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\nThe federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, helps low-income Americans pay their heating and cooling bills. The money is distributed through states and local community groups, but only 34 states and the District of Columbia offer cooling aid to their residents. All states run programs to help people keep the heat on in the winter.\n\nWhat’s more, just 15% of the federal funds is used to cover cooling costs.\n\nCongress poured $4.5 billion into LIHEAP from the American Rescue Plan, adding to the program’s $3.8 billion allocation for the current fiscal year. But it still isn’t enough to meet the need for heating alone, much less cooling.\n\n“The core problem is we don’t have enough money to run a robust cooling program,” Wolfe said, noting that the importance of this hasn’t “registered yet” in Congress.\n\nAlice Gachuzo-Colin of Springdale, Arkansas, turned to a local nonprofit agency last month to ask for help paying her electric bill so her power wouldn’t be shut off in the middle of the night. But she was told it had no available funds and to try again later.\n\nSo she had to drain nearly all her savings to pay the $256 bill. And for July, the tab is $314, which she has had to point out to her three children.\n\n“Yesterday, there was a big, huge meltdown in my house because my kids were like ‘I’m hot,’ and I’m like ‘Y’all, the light bill is 300 and something dollars,’” Gachuzo-Colin, 43, who works as a personal banker at a local bank, said in mid-July.\n\nTypically, she pays $160 or $170 a month during the summer.\n\nGachuzo-Colin tries to limit the family’s air conditioning usage, but it’s tough when the temperature often exceeds 90 degrees and her 13-year-old daughter’s asthma worsens in the heat. The Springdale area is on track to have its fourth-warmest summer on record.\n\nElectric companies have expanded their flexible billing and payment programs during the pandemic to help customers stay current, Adam Cooper, senior director for customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned electric companies, wrote in an email. Many allow customers to enter balance billing programs, where they pay the same amount every month. This smooths out seasonal spikes in usage.\n\nThe companies also reach out to consumers suffering from financial hardships and educate them about assistance programs, such as LIHEAP, Cooper said.\n\nBut repayment plans don’t always relieve the financial strain on families. Minneapolis resident Scott Norcross entered one recently so his power wouldn’t be shut off after he fell a few hundred dollars behind in payments, mainly from using the air conditioner over the last few months. He now has to shell out around $100 on top of his monthly bill, which he says is three times more than it used to be prior to the pandemic.\n\n“Our electric bill had just gone higher and higher and higher,” said Norcross, 55, who is disabled and is affected by the heat. “We can’t really afford the extra payment, but we have to do something if we want to keep the electric on.”\n\nNorcross, whose wife is a personal care assistant and older son works in retail, applied for energy aid but was told his family’s income was $800 over the limit.\n\nSo the couple and their two young adult sons sit in their car and run the air conditioner for 20 to 30 minutes to cool off a few times a day, depending on how hot it is. The temperature climbed to at least 90 degrees on Tuesday, which would be the 13th time it’s hit that level this year.\n\nShutoffs loom\n\nOnly 17 states, plus the District of Columbia, have protections that prevent utility companies from turning off the power of people who fall behind in their bills. But they only take effect when temperatures hit a certain level or when a heat advisory is in place, Wolfe said. For Nevada and Delaware, for instance, that threshold is 105 degrees.\n\nThis compares to 33 states and the District of Columbia that prevent utilities from shutting off the heat during the winter.\n\nNearly all states and the District of Columbia provide some protection for residents with certified medical conditions, though many only delay the disconnection for 30 days.\n\nStill, many people whose health is compromised by hot temperatures don’t qualify.\n\nThough he suffers from a thyroid condition that makes him very sensitive to heat, Walter Protheroe now sets his air conditioner at 78 degrees, instead of a more comfortable 72 degrees. That keeps his electric bill affordable since he’s disabled and living on a fixed income.\n\nBut it means the 64-year-old Houston resident has to spend most of the day lying down on the couch. He can only take short walks outside twice a week, instead of his daily one-mile stroll, because he can’t return to a cool home in a city contending with its hottest summer to date.\n\nA former research engineer, Protheroe thought his June bill would be around $90, but it was $125. He’s expecting to have to shell out about $150 this month and probably more than $170 in August if the heat continues.\n\n“I just deal with it the best I can,” said Protheroe. “It’s just too expensive to run the air conditioner that much.”", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/06/economy/rising-cost-child-care/index.html", "title": "Child care centers can't afford to stay open. Here's what this means ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nFrom city centers to rural communities, many US child care providers are raising the price of tuition to combat inflation, adding yet another strain for families.\n\nAt KidzStuff Childcare Center in Baltimore, the cost of food, rent, power and supplies is soaring. CEO Angela Kidane has raised her staff’s salaries by roughly 40% amid a tight labor market, but she’s still struggling to hire teachers. That has forced her to close at least one classroom, which could cost the nonprofit organization as much as $150,000 for the year.\n\n“We probably are up at least 30-to-35% in operating costs,” Kidane told CNN. “What goes through my mind is, how’s that going to affect our parents? We’re going to have to pass on the cost.”\n\nThis fall, Kidane will raise tuition for the third time in 12 months — in all, up 30%. For some families, full-time child care could cost thousands of dollars more per year.\n\n“It’s not easy for us to have to do this, but it is a necessity,” Kidane said. “We couldn’t survive. We wouldn’t stay open.”\n\nChildren play outside at a child care center in Baltimore. CNN\n\nChild care programs nationwide are raising rates for the same reasons.\n\n“It’s happening everywhere,” National Child Care Association Director Cindy Lehnhoff said. “[Programs] don’t have an alternative to keep the doors open, this is what has to happen. And they hate doing it to the parents, they hate it.”\n\nInflation isn’t the only problem\n\nInflation is only one part of the problem. There are 11.2% fewer child care workers in the industry than before the pandemic, despite federal relief funds that helped programs boost salaries (at least a little), according to a report from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. As of last year, the median wage in the industry was just over $13 per hour, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nA study found as of March 2021, nearly 16,000 child care programs had closed during the pandemic — roughly 9% of the industry’s licensed programs — creating longer waitlists and steeper tuition for parents.\n\n“We’re hearing from people all over the country that child care costs are unaffordable, and we’re also hearing from parents who are child care workers that they’re not earning living wages,” MomsRising Executive Director Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner said.\n\n“Already, a half million families in the United States of America are estimated to be without child care because of lack of access and affordability,” she added. “With increasing pressure due to inflation, even more families are getting stranded without child care.”\n\nDemand for child care could surge even further with Covid-19 vaccines now available for children under 5. San Diego-based company TOOTRiS, which connects parents with licensed child care providers, said it has seen waitlists grow roughly 25% in recent months.\n\n“Families can’t wait to get their children back into child care in a safe way,” TOOTRiS CEO Alessandra Lezama said. “Coupled with the fact that so many programs were forced to shut down during Covid, the supply and demand issue has been aggravated.”\n\n‘We don’t want to charge our parents more’\n\nAt Beach Babies Child Care, which has several branches in the Rehoboth Beach area of Delaware, owner Sean Toner is raising tuition 8% to 10% this fall for the second straight year to combat inflation and raise teacher salaries to roughly $14 per hour.\n\n“We don’t want to charge our parents more for a good that shouldn’t cost this much,” Toner said. “I don’t want to be that person that’s driving away the parents.”\n\nJessica Gebbia is a teacher at Beach Babies. Her 5-year-old son also goes there for day care.\n\n“Most of my paycheck is going just to have him here,” Gebbia said. “That’s rough, because now we have gas prices, food prices, everything’s just going up and up.”\n\nBut Gebbia doesn’t want to leave her job.\n\n“I love what I do,” she said. “These children need teachers who do love what they do.”\n\nA classroom sits empty at Beach Buddies in Lewes, Delaware, amid a struggle to hire staff. CNN\n\nBut many mothers have left the workforce. It’s part of a growing trend: As of May, women’s jobs made up 88% of those lost in the pandemic, according to the Labor Department.\n\nWhile pandemic relief funds helped stabilize child care providers somewhat, those funds are set to expire in the next two years. Advocates worry the industry could be headed for a cliff, and are urging for more federal investment in child care to bridge the gap between providers’ tight margins and the rising cost to families.\n\n“The pandemic has made it nearly impossible for providers to continue, and the current market conditions have made it even more difficult,” said Michelle Kang, CEO of National Association for the Education of Young Children. “Without action to shore up and strengthen supply, we are headed for catastrophe, which would leave families without care options.”\n\nAs child care prices rise, millions of families are facing difficult decisions.\n\nTo-Wen Tseng and her husband have struggled to afford child care for $370 per week in San Diego since her employer cut her hours in half. So she flew her kids to Taiwan to stay with family for the summer as she searches for a second job.\n\n“If I just quit my job and stayed home and watch my kids, maybe the whole thing will be easier for my family,” Tseng said. “The reason why we’re still struggling to pay for this child care, it’s because I don’t want to give up my career. I’m trying so hard because I feel that I should be an example to my kids.”", "authors": ["Gabe Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}]}

George said Manson claimed that as workers were pushing the steel casing through the hole, they hit hard material described as “cobble” that derailed and damaged the sectional casing. They were unable to pull the casing back out, he said.\n\n“They decided it was easier for them to just move 10 feet away … and start drilling a new hole from land,” he said. That newly drilled hole will curve around the obstruction, and reconnect with the original path leading to the diffusers where wastewater will be dispersed into the ocean about one mile offshore.\n\nThe city is facing a June 1 deadline to stop discharging its wastewater into the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal, stemming from a 1998 order to stop direct discharges polluting the Inland Bays.\n\nFor years, city officials debated how to best dispose of the resort town's waste. Under former Mayor Sam Cooper, the Atlantic Ocean outfall project was chosen over alternative methods such as spray irrigation, despite outcries from environmentalists. They worried about the impact of construction and pollution on marine life, as well as the possible negative impacts impaired water quality could mean for beach tourism.\n\nWhile the city has the approval of voters and state officials to borrow up to $52.5 million for the project – which includes the mile-long ocean pipe and 40-foot-deep diffusers, a force main to send water from the treatment plant to the beach and upgrades at the wastewater treatment facility – so far, contracts add up to about $37 million.\n\nIt remains unclear who will bear the burden of the cost of drilling a second hole for the outfall pipe, said city spokeswoman Krys Johnson.\n\nManson Construction did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRehoboth Beach Commissioner Lisa Schlosser said until recently, things were going well.\n\nBut at a recent city workshop meeting, Schlosser questioned why large change orders – like an additional $40,000 for work on the force main portion of the project – seem to crop up every time the city tackles large construction projects.\n\n“The city is continuously over budget and over schedule on projects like this,” she said. City officials said the project is not over budget, citing a $2 million credit offered by Manson Construction.\n\nAs for the June 1 deadline, George said force main work should be done by then. Meeting a March 31 deadline for ocean work will heavily depend on weather. Neither the city nor state officials immediately responded to questions about what will happen if those deadlines are missed.\n\n\"The city has the expectation the project will complete successfully and timely,\" Rehoboth City Manager Sharon Lynn said in an emailed statement provided by Johnson.\n\nWilliam Ullman, a professor at the University of Delaware’s School of Marine Science and Policy, said it is not unusual for problems to arise on large projects like an ocean outfall, but it is unusual to encounter cobble off Delaware’s coast.\n\n“Cobbles [can be about] the size of a fist,” he said. “I’ve only been around for 30 years, but I’ve never seen that kind of material come out of that area. I’m just surprised they ran into something that would be a cobble or something geological they couldn’t get through. The engineers for Rehoboth did a survey and found nothing out there that was going to cause a problem, so to stumble upon it while drilling is kind of bizarre.”\n\nUllman’s colleague Arthur Trembanis agreed that cobbles are uncommon, but encountering a large, impassable object underground in Delaware isn’t impossible. There is also a chance the engineering surveys done before drilling began could have missed the reported obstruction, he said.\n\n“Are cobbles possible? Yes,” said Trembanis, an associate professor who directs UD’s coastal sediments hydrodynamics and engineering lab. “Even boulder-size deposits, but they are not super common. It depends on the depth.”\n\nThe drilling snafu is not the only recent upset for the project, which began last year after waiting years for approval. Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Shawn Garvin signed off on the outfall permits in May.\n\nRecent back-to-back nor’easters have delayed work. Manson’s barge retreated to the Broadkill River near DNREC’s Pilottown Road office in early March as storm-fueled winds and waves created dangerous conditions, and has not yet returned.\n\nContractors need at least 15 days of good weather – at the peak of Delaware’s nor’easter season – to complete the ocean portion of Rehoboth’s new wastewater disposal system, George said. Permits require ocean work to be completed by March 31 to avoid impacts on marine life, some of which are already migrating into the area.\n\n“Right now, on paper it’s showing it is possible,” George said.\n\nEnvironmentalists worry that if work continues past the March 31 deadline – which has already been extended from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers original Feb. 28 deadline – sensitive species could be jeopardized. The Corps did not respond to an interview request.\n\n“It seems like whenever a construction project asks for an extension, they get it,” said Suzanne Thurman, executive director of the Lewes-based Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute. “The violations of the Marine Mammal Protection Act are blatant.”\n\nThurman said dolphins are arriving along the coast, and it is about to be peak time for seals in the area. Of most concern, she said, are the large whales that will soon be migrating nearby.\n\n“They usually start at the end of March, April and May,” she said. “And three large whale species are under an unusual mortality event declared by NOAA. All three of those species occur in these waters. That’s a huge concern.”\n\nOther environmentalists also have raised concerns about the endangered Atlantic sturgeon, which spends most of its adult life in the ocean and moves to coastal rivers to spawn in April and May.\n\n“Our Delaware River population of sturgeon are genetically unique and there are only 300 spawning adults left,” said Delaware Riverkeeper Maya van Rossum. “They are literally on the brink, and every time we turn around they are facing another threat and another approval that will impact their numbers from our government agencies.”\n\nThurman’s arguments about potential environmental harms of the outfall have largely been ignored. An appeal she filed against the project last year was dismissed because the state Environmental Appeals Board ruled she had no standing. Federal and state permits assert any negative impacts would be minimal, and that most animals are able to get out of the way.\n\nA work in progress\n\nInstalling more than 11,000 feet of force main, which will send treated wastewater from the city’s treatment plant at the south end of Roosevelt Street to Deauville Beach and into the ocean, also has hit some literal bumps in the road.\n\nRehoboth commissioners last week approved a $40,000 change order after engineers discovered a county sewer line on Canal Street near where they hoped to install the new 24-inch pipe.\n\nAt that meeting, Rehoboth Commissioner Schlosser questioned why the contractors were not aware those sewer lines existed.\n\n“I'm not an expert in laying pipe, I'm not I admit it, but it seems like this is pretty fundamental to this project,\" she said. \"What are we doing to anticipate fundamental project elements going forward so $40,000 here, $50,000 there ... is not going to happen in the future? This continuously happens here.\"\n\nRehoboth Beach Mayor Paul Kuhns asserted the city is not over budget.\n\n\"We're not even close to being over budget,\" he said.\n\nThe multifaceted outfall project is supported by $52.5 million in low-interest loans from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, with $40.5 million for the outfall project and $12 million for a planned biosolids project and other treatment plant upgrades. The council approved issuing those loans at a 2-percent interest rate in August 2017.\n\nThe state previously approved a $25 million loan for an ocean outfall in 2015, which was increased to $40.5 million last year.\n\nAll current accepted bids for the outfall, treatment plant upgrades, pumping station and force main add up to about $37 million. Kuhns cited a total project cost of about $43 million, accounting for additional engineering fees and contingency money.\n\nThat includes $27,655,850 for Manson Construction’s outfall work, $5.7 million for A-Del Construction’s force main work, and $4.02 million for Allan Myers MD Inc., to upgrade the plant and construct a pumping station.\n\nThose bids and estimates do not include a second phase of upgrades at the treatment plant estimated to cost $9.2 million in the state's funding review.\n\nJohnson did not respond a request for clarification about the biosolids project and the $12 million loan, but minutes from an Aug. 7, 2017, commissioners meeting show that officials said the $12 million would be \"reallocated\" for plant improvements – more than a week before the loans were recommended for approval by the state council.\n\nEngineers meet on a weekly and monthly basis with contractors, engineers and federal, state, county and city officials about the challenges, finances and progress of the projects. But those meetings are closed to the public because there is not a quorum of elected officials present.\n\n“We provide information to the public every time we have meetings,” Kuhns said. He said technical information shared in those “high-level, internal operational meetings” is boiled down and presented to the public during workshops held every two months.\n\nThe county is involved in the outfall project as a “participant” with oversight, but no decision-making power since an agreement was signed last year, said Sussex County Engineer Hans Medlarz, a voting member of the council that approved Rehoboth's loans.\n\nOnce the outfall is online, Rehoboth will send its solid waste to the county for treatment and disposal.

I've heard she used to live in Asheville. Is she still here? She lived here for some years and was active and effective at my church, First Presbyterian Church-Asheville. She also was the leading force behind a major effort to build/raise major funds for a major Performing Arts Center in Asheville. Where is she now?\n\nMy answer: Well, some critics may say La-La Land.\n\nReal answer: Powell, 65, has gained a degree of notoriety of late for her representation of President Donald Trump and her pursuit of legal actions related to the election on his behalf. Unfortunately, these efforts include multiple debunked claims about international interference in the election and computer algorithms that allegedly switched votes to Biden.\n\nAgain, they've been debunked. Spoiler alert: Joe Biden won the election.\n\nIn a fact check of Powell claims, USA Today cited this quote from Powell during an appearance on C-SPAN: \"We are not going to be intimidated. We are not going to back down. We are going to clean this mess up now. President Trump won by a landslide. We are going to prove it. And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.\"\n\nOkey, dokey.\n\nPowell took things further, alleging \"that some voting software was created at the direction of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,\" according to BBC News. Chavez died in 2013.\n\nMore:Boyle column: No, Donald Trump isn't likable. He's also not fit for office\n\nIn another article, USA Today noted the \"Trump campaign recently distanced themselves from Powell and stated she was not a member of the president's legal team, despite appearing beside Trump lawyers at a news conference for the campaign in November.\"\n\nThe article also mentioned a lawsuit Powell filed in Wisconsin that cites \"the TCF Center, which is not in Wisconsin, but rather is a convention center in Detroit. Several lawsuits filed by Trump’s legal team, or on behalf of his campaign, have been riddled with mistakes,\" the USA Today article states.\n\nPolitico, in a Nov. 22 story, noted the shakeup with Powell came as she made \"far-fetched and unsupported claims of voter fraud in the 2020 elections.\" Powell \"also represents former national security adviser Michael Flynn in his long-running attempt to unravel a guilty plea for lying about his 2016 contacts with Russia,\" the article notes.\n\nMore:As Biden transition progresses, Cawthorn continues to raise money off resistance\n\nThat same article pointed that Trump had \"announced Powell as a centerpiece of his legal team in a recent tweet, declaring that she, (Rudy) Giuliani and others would form a team that would later dub itself an 'elite strike force.'”\n\nSo yes, Powell has been in the news. And she did live here and was involved in the community.\n\nThe Citizen Times archives contains multiple news stories including Powell, including references to philanthropic work through First Presbyterian Church, and other initiatives.\n\nPastor Patrick Johnson at First Presbyterian said Powell was an active member in the church and with local philanthropic efforts, but he said Powell has not been involved in the church for about the last 10 years. His understanding was she moved to Texas about 10 years ago, he said.\n\nA 2004 Citizen Times article cites Powell as \"head of the board of Asheville Area Center for the Performing Arts,\" a now-dormant effort to secure land and build a new performing arts center in downtown Asheville. An October 2005 article quotes Powell regarding the plans for the performing arts center, saying board members had visited several cities to look at their centers.\n\n\"I think it would be a crown jewel for the city and huge center of economic development for downtown,\" Powell said then. \"People love to come here anyway, it gives them another significant reason to come.\"\n\nMore:Answer Man: Exploding rats? What happens if Trump or Biden dies before inauguration?\n\nA 2014 Citizen Times story noted Powell was a driving force in founding The Genesis Alliance in 2004, after citing a need for advocacy around domestic violence. Genesis raised funds for Helpmate, Buncombe County's local domestic violence agency, among other efforts.\n\nLisa-Gaye Hall, administrator the Buncombe County Bar, said Powell was the featured speaker for a Bar luncheon in September 2014.\n\n\"I think she's been gone now for a couple of years,\" Hall said. \"But she definitely lived here and was a member of the bar for a while.\"\n\nHall clarified that Powell was an \"associate member of the Buncombe Bar, not a regular member.\" Any licensed attorney in any state can pay $150 annually to be an associate member of the local bar.\n\nPowell, a graduate of UNC Chapel Hill Law School, is licensed to practice law in Texas and lists her law office as being located in Dallas.\n\nShe is not listed as being licensed in North Carolina, according to the N.C. Bar, but lawyers who practice in federal court often work in multiple states, as long as they get certification to work there. Typically, they'll work with a local attorney who is licensed in that state.\n\nMore:Answer Man: Feral hogs roaming the mountains, or just domesticated pigs on the lam?\n\nPowell, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, spoke to the Buncombe Bar not long after the release of her book, \"License to Lie: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice,\" which Amazon.com describes in part as \"...the book that began exposing 'the Deep State.'\"\n\nPowell's website states she is based in Dallas, Texas, and specializes in federal appeals and complex cases.\n\n\"The firm accepts only a few selected cases each year and gives each the personal time and attention it deserves,\" the website states, noting that clients include \"lawyers, judges, prominent individuals, cities, counties, and international corporations.\"\n\nHome ownership here\n\nAt one point, Powell, or an associated corporation, owned two homes in Asheville, one in Biltmore Forest and one in Biltmore Park.\n\nPowell owned the Biltmore Forest home individually until December 2012, when she transferred the deed to Fawkes Partners LP (limited partnership). The North Carolina Secretary of State's website shows Powell is the \"registered agent\" for the corporation, which was incorporated in Texas and has a primary address in Dallas, but also has a local office listed as the Biltmore Forest address.\n\nThe Biltmore Forest home sits on a 1.43-acre lot and has an appraised tax value of $812,700, according to Buncombe County property records.\n\nPowell had another company, WBP Holdings LLC, that shared ownership of the Biltmore Park Home with Fawkes Partners LP. WBP Holdings has been dissolved.\n\nThe Biltmore Park home was sold to a local couple in 2017.\n\nSome documents list a Hendersonville Road law office for Powell, but that phone number has been disconnected.\n\nI left a message at Powell's Dallas office but haven't heard back. I know she's busy these days, as she's still filing legal actions regarding the election, but if I hear back I'll provide an update.\n\nThis is the opinion of John Boyle.

Including loans sourced from institutional investors via the IFC, that figure rises to around $485 million.\n\nThe loans could contravene the IFC’s own internal guidelines — known as its Performance Standards — which function entirely to “prevent IFC from financing projects that will have adverse environmental and social impacts that jeopardize [its] development aims,” according to the report.\n\nCNN Business was granted exclusive, advance access to the report, which was led by the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice at Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom and published by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nThe Helena Kennedy Center for International Justice researches modern day slavery, gender-based violence and hate crime and has previously published reports alleging the use of forced labor in Xinjiang to produce cotton and solar panels. They say the four named companies are not the only businesses receiving IFC funds in the region.\n\n“I think it’s clear that the IFC needs to divest from all their investments in the Uyghur region,” said report author Laura Murphy, a professor in Human Rights and Contemporary Slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who added that it is “incumbent on the IFC based on their own standards that they ensure that their clients are not involved in forced labor.”\n\nI think it’s clear that the IFC needs to divest from all their investments in the Uyghur region Laura Murphy, Sheffield Hallam University\n\nIn a statement, an IFC spokesperson told CNN the corporation has “strong environment, social and governance (ESG) standards” that are diligently applied during the life of the investment and are considered a model for development finance worldwide.\n\n“We do not tolerate discrimination or forced labor under any circumstances,” the spokesperson said. “Whenever such serious allegations are brought to our attention, we work to verify and address them with our clients with urgency.”\n\nBeijing responded to the report on Thursday, saying it was “false” and “full of lies and groundless accusations.”\n\n“It is understood that the organization has no staff in Xinjiang. There was no field investigation, no real research, no evidence to back up the report,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing.\n\n“The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of human rights and workers’ rights and interests. For some time now, certain countries have been hyping up social lies and extending their reach to multilateral development institutions,” Wang added.\n\nCNN sought comment from the four Chinese companies named in the report but did not receive a response. The report’s authors also said they attempted to contact them but did not receive a response.\n\nPolice officers patrolling the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China in 2018. Kyodo News/Kyodo News Stills/Kyodo News via Getty Images\n\n‘Punished with internment’\n\nXinjiang has become a geopolitical hotspot because of the breadth of human rights abuses alleged to have taken place in the region, including what some Western governments have called the “genocide” of Uyghurs and other minorities.\n\nThe US State Department has estimated that since 2017 up to two million members of religious and ethnic minorities have been imprisoned in a shadowy network of internment camps.\n\nChina has described the facilities as “vocational training centers” where people learn job skills, Chinese language and laws, and officials declared in 2019 that such centers — also aimed at deradicalizing local Muslims — had been closed down. They also claimed that the original detainees had graduated but that people were still enrolling to gain new skills.\n\nWestern governments and human rights organizations have alleged that minorities in the region have been subjected to forced labor through job creation schemes run by the Chinese government to achieve “poverty alleviation.”\n\nWorkers who have participated in those job programs have told CNN that if they did not take the jobs they were offered, for a fraction of the usual rate of pay, they were warned they would be sent to camps.\n\n“The Chinese government has embarked on a massive campaign which they deem to be poverty alleviation,” said Murphy of Sheffield Hallam. “These programs are often non-consensual, and people who refuse can be punished with internment.”\n\nSuch attempts to attack and smear China based on lies and disinformation are bound to fail Chinese government statement\n\nChina has consistently denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and told CNN in a statement prior to publication that claims of forced labor were lies created to smear its reputation.\n\n“China has repeatedly emphasized that the so-called issues of ‘forced labor’ and ‘repression’ against ethnic minorities are huge lies concocted by anti-China forces in the US and the West. They are entirely baseless. Such attempts to attack and smear China based on lies and disinformation are bound to fail,” the statement said.\n\nA watchtower at a high-security facility near what is believed to be a re-education camp on the outskirts of Hotan, Xinjiang. Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConcerns raised about IFC outcomes\n\nBased in Washington, D.C., the IFC describes itself as the “largest global development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries.”\n\nIt is part of the World Bank Group and says it provided roughly $31.5 billion in loans and other financial assistance — including nearly $12 billion in “fragile, conflict-affected, and poverty-stricken countries” — last fiscal year to private companies and financial institutions in emerging and developing economies around the world.\n\nThe IFC spokesperson told CNN its mission is to “fight poverty by helping the private sector thrive.” “In doing so, we create jobs and raise living standards, especially for the poor and vulnerable,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBut its investments have been criticized for years by charities that accuse the IFC of sometimes causing more harm than good by failing to carry out due diligence.\n\nIn 2015, Oxfam International published a report compiled with input from several NGOs that claimed the IFC sent billions of dollars in “out of control” investments to third parties that caused “human rights abuses around the world.”\n\nIFC said at the time that it was working with its clients to resolve issues raised by Oxfam and other civil society organizations and that it valued any insights into those concerns. The organization also said that it took additional efforts to train its staff and be more selective about its clients and was strengthening oversight and supervision.\n\nThe World Bank Group had been acknowledging concerns even prior to that report. In 2013, the organization’s Independent Evaluation Group highlighted declining “outcome ratings” for IFC-financed projects and advised the IFC to focus on “supervision” and “enhancing the quality of projects” through “intensified efforts.”\n\nCNN approached the World Bank Group for comment about the Helena Kennedy Centre’s findings, and a spokesperson directed CNN to the IFC’s response.\n\nThe World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C. Daniel Slim/AFP/via Getty Images\n\nAlleged connections to forced labor\n\nThe four Chinese companies with ties to Xinjiang named in the Helena Kennedy Centre report work in sectors ranging from food to pharmaceuticals and energy. Using corporate documents, stock exchange filings, Chinese state media reports, IFC disclosures and satellite imagery, the report claims these companies have ties to parts of the region where allegations of forced labor are rampant.\n\nIn some cases, the report says these companies have participated in state-endorsed “labor transfer” or “poverty alleviation” schemes, which international human rights organizations and foreign governments have for years claimed perpetuate forced labor in the region.\n\nCNN has independently verified that the four companies named in the Helena Kennedy Centre report have all received loans from the IFC in recent years. At least two of those loans, made to Camel Group and Jointown Pharmaceutical, have been used to finance projects in Xinjiang. Because the firms are all publicly traded on Chinese stock exchanges, corporate filings detail some of their dealings in the region. Chinese state media reports also explain some of their work, while the IFC’s own records shed some light on the organization’s involvement in providing financing to these firms.\n\nOne company, Chenguang Biotech Group, makes food additives, natural dyes and pigments, and sources its raw materials primarily from India and Xinjiang. In Xinjiang, the company is involved in the production of marigolds.\n\nThe IFC, which loaned Chenguang $40 million in 2019 so the company could increase production, conducted an assessment that found the company’s risk of being implicated in forced labor with respect to marigold growers to be “low” and that overall “the risks in Chenguang’s primary supply chain are low to medium.”\n\nBut according to the Helena Kennedy Centre report, Chenguang sources some of its workforce from “coercive” state-sponsored labor and land transfer programs.\n\nThe report claims that in some cases farmers have no say in whether to participate in major farming projects, or what they want to plant. Companies, too, are under pressure to support state programs.\n\nCiting an official press release, the report said that, in one case, the paramilitary organization Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which controls the region economically and politically, conducted “ideological work” on those who expressed reluctance about changing their farming methods, which the report described as a method of “coercing” minorities.\n\nThose people are encouraged by government agencies to “relinquish their land, change their crops, alter their farming methods, work for cooperatives or large-scale farms that have expropriated their lands, or move to factory labor,” the report said.\n\nAnother company, the battery maker Camel Group, received nearly $36 million in funding from the IFC in July 2019 to expand its battery recycling operations in parts of China, including Xinjiang, according to IFC documents. Chinese corporate records also show the company has at least two subsidiaries in the region.\n\nAn IFC risk assessment did acknowledge “potentially significant adverse environmental or societal risks” on account of smelting waste lead but added that Camel promised the organization it would promote the hiring of more local minority residents in Xinjiang. IFC also assessed that “no forced labor practices” are used by Camel Group and that its battery suppliers are subject to quarterly audits by the company to ensure they are complaint with child and forced labor inspections.\n\nHowever, the Helena Kennedy Centre report cited government press releases that it says show Camel has benefited from state-sponsored labor transfer programs. In July 2017, according to one government release, 165 laborers were taken across Xinjiang for a 10-day long “closed pre-job training,” which the report authors say was an indication that their movements were restricted.\n\nDuring that time, according to a government press release, the participants received “military and ideological training,” and “were required to sing patriotic songs” and learn Mandarin Chinese — measures that human rights organizations worry can lead to the erasure of culture for Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz in Xinjiang. Those groups speak languages closer to Turkish than Mandarin Chinese.\n\nBefore the laborers were dispatched to their assigned companies — one of which was Camel — they were made to attend a flag-raising ceremony, affirm their loyalty to the ruling Chinese Communist Party and pledge to “make due contributions to national security, national unity, social stability and harmony,” according to the government press release.\n\nA third company, the fertilizer and materials firm Century Sunshine Group, received $165 million from the IFC between 2014 and 2016, according to IFC documents. That figure includes $125 million to upgrade a fertilizer manufacturing facility in Jiangsu province, north of Shanghai on China’s eastern coast. As of December 2020, IFC had roughly a 17% stake in the company, according to an annual report from Century Sunshine.\n\nCentury Sunshine also has ties to Xinjiang. The report cited local state-run media from December 2017 that said the company’s Xinjiang subsidiary took in 10 rural laborers from a township in eastern Xinjiang through state-sponsored labor transfer programs. Two years later, that same subsidiary was one of nine firms that participated in a state-backed labor recruitment event that encouraged off-season farmers to work for industrial manufacturing facilities in the area — an event involving labor transfer the report’s authors said was at “high risk”of violating standards for labor and working conditions.\n\nThe final company implicated in the report, Jointown Pharmaceutical, received nearly $200 million in debt financing from the IFC in the last few years, according to IFC documents. IFC assessed their investments in Jointown Pharmaceutical as having “limited” environmental or social risks.\n\nThe company — which distributes personal protection equipment, medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs — received nearly $150 million in July 2019 to build distribution centers and upgrade four warehouses in middle and western China, including Xinjiang. In October 2020, Jointown Pharmaceutical received another $50 million to buy pharmaceutical products and expand distribution because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLike Camel and Century Sunshine, the Helena Kennedy Centre report alleges that Jointown Pharmaceutical has participated in Xinjiang-related labor transfer programs. The report cited an article published in December 2020 by the Xinjiang Food and Drug Administration on its official WeChat account that said Jointown Pharmaceutical acknowledged receiving “more than 200” workers “transferred” from southern Xinjiang and other remote and underdeveloped prefectures through the labor programs.\n\nThe report also said that Jointown Pharmaceutical has “many” facilities in Xinjiang that are located next to buildings identified as internment camps by the Australian Strategy Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank. One of Jointown Pharmaceutical’s facilities in the regional capital of Urumqi, for example, is in one of the city’s “largest prison districts,” according to the report.\n\nEfforts to monitor investments in Xinjiang\n\nWhile travel to Xinjiang by foreign organizations has become almost impossible in recent years, the Helena Kennedy Centre report says the IFC paid a one-day visit to the region in 2019, during the height of the government crackdown there.\n\nReport co-author Kendyl Salcito, the Executive Director of human rights research non-profit NomoGaia, told CNN she spoke via phone to an IFC representative who went on the trip. The employee told Salcito that their group was temporarily detained by police three times within a roughly 24-hour period, adding that the atmosphere was very uncomfortable and they wanted to leave quickly.\n\nThe IFC continued to fund projects in the region after that visit, as seen in IFC documents reviewed by the report authors and by CNN. In November 2020, Salcito said, the IFC told her that it did not have alternative arrangements for monitoring projects there.\n\nThe IFC did not respond to CNN’s questions about Salcito’s account of the trip. However, the spokesperson told CNN that in the last two years the IFC has dedicated more resources to supervising companies it works with in Xinjiang.\n\n“While accessing projects on the ground has been more difficult for all development actors in the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, IFC has dedicated more resources to supervising the companies we work with regarding adherence to our ESG standards. These standards are legally binding, include protections for workers, communities, and the environment, and expressly prohibit discrimination and the use of forced labor,” the spokesperson said.\n\nParamilitary police vehicles on a road in Artux in China's northwest Xinjiang region in June, 2019. Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe IFC has taken some steps to withdraw from the region. It ceased its relationships with three other Chinese firms that “were engaged or sourcing from companies engaged in repression in the Uyghur Region,” according to the report.\n\nThe IFC did not respond to CNN’s questions about why it chose to divest those companies and not others.\n\nIn 2020, the IFC told Salcito in email exchanges viewed by CNN that the Chinese companies it works with assured the organization they did not use any forced labor. The IFC did not respond to CNN’s questions about that correspondence. The Helena Kennedy Centre report authors say that form of self-reporting is wholly insufficient.\n\n“The continued willingness to provide financing in the region, without any direct oversight, indicates that its investment strategy in the region continues to overlook the ongoing crimes against humanity and Performance Standards violations that render the IFC’s investments complicit,” the report said.\n\nA lack of due diligence\n\nMultinational corporations have for years found it difficult to perform due diligence on their supply chains linked to Xinjiang because of limited access, surveillance and the threat of government interference. That makes the use of publicly available records and satellite imagery all the more important in determining whether a firm has ties to forced labor in the region.\n\nSatellite images, for example, have shown that detention facilities are often built up simultaneously alongside factories and business parks, which human rights activists say is a clear indication that factory workers are being drawn from the prison or camp population.\n\nMaxar satellite imagery of a re-education internment camp in Hotan, Xinjiang, China. Maxar Technologies/DigitalGlobe/ScapeWare3d/Getty Images\n\nSome companies, investors and other organizations have pulled out of the region because of the difficulties in auditing activity there. Many international auditors will no longer certify products made in Xinjiang, and the Fair Labor Association — a Washington-based non-profit whose members include multinational corporations and Ivy League universities — has banned its members from sourcing from Xinjiang due to an inability to gather accurate information, or to verify if workers there are under duress.\n\n“The underlying problem in the Uyghur region is the political repression is so great, we’re of the view that no company can do adequate human rights due diligence,” said Sophie Richardson, China Director of Human Rights Watch. “Where [a company] can’t do adequate human rights due diligence, it should withdraw.”\n\nForeign governments have also been piling pressure on companies. In December, US President Joe Biden signed into law new rules that will effectively ban imports of products made in Xinjiang.\n\nWashington is also leading a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which conclude Sunday. In December, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the United States would not continue do “business as usual” and participate in the “fanfare” of the Games because of the “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”\n\nBut activists also point out that governments that work with the IFC should also review their funding plans. The United States, after all, has plowed more than $23 billion over the last 20 years into the World Bank Group, and as of June 2021 was the largest IFC shareholder with a stake of about 21%.\n\nThat funding has increased during the pandemic: In March 2020, the World Bank Group announced that the US government authorized a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the US Treasury Department said that it “works closely with other parts of the United States government to strongly condemn and respond to the atrocities taking place in Xinjiang.”\n\nIt said the government had pressed multilateral development banks (MDBs) — including the IFC — to strengthen their safeguards so projects “do not inadvertently support companies that participate in or benefit from forced labor.”\n\nThe statement added: “The US has been — and will continue to be -— a lead voice on this issue in all the MDBs and will continue working with other shareholder countries to make companies with alleged linkages to forced labor practices ineligible for MDB investments.”", "authors": ["Rebecca Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/10/18/gay-marriage-ruling-life-changes-newlyweds/17528251/", "title": "After gay marriage ruling, life changes for newlyweds", "text": "Beth Walton\n\nASH\n\nASHEVI LLE — Entering the Smith-Hendrix household can be a little insane, warned Leigh Smith as she opened the door to her modest West Asheville home, found on a quiet residential street.\n\nWith two children younger than 5, there are seldom moments of silence.\n\nBefore the door even closed, Joe, 3, squirmed off his mother's hip to eagerly show off the picture he had drawn of a scary monster. His older sister, Quinn, 4, put down the book she was reading and vied for attention.\n\nThe house may be a bit crazy, but it's filled with love, said Smith, 41, as she gently hushed the children's chatter and sat down next to her wife, Crystal Hendrix.\n\nThe two have been together for 10 years, and Oct. 10, they married for the first time, in front of their children, friends and family outside the Buncombe County Register of Deeds Office.\n\nHistory was made in Asheville that day after U.S. District Court Judge Max O. Cogburn Jr. issued a ruling declaring the state's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.\n\nIn a flurry of wedded bliss since then, 189 marriage licenses have been given out in Buncombe County. The county does not keep a separate count for same-sex couples, though a typical week would see about 50 licenses issued.\n\nFor gay couples married since the ruling, life has changed in both simple and sweeping ways.\n\nAt Hendrix and Smith's unexpected ceremony, the children held flowers and the guests cried, said Hendrix, 42.\n\nTheir daughter, who is too little to understand everything about weddings, wondered why there wasn't more dancing and cake, she said, smiling.\n\n\"At first, it felt like it was just one more step, it was just one more piece of paper that would give us more protection as a family,\" she added. \"It did that, but at the same time, it was also so much more. It was also very emotional.\"\n\nThough a victory for them, Smith and Hendrix still have challenges ahead.\n\nMembers of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU challenging North Carolina's ban on second-parent adoption, the two have spent years fighting for the children of nontraditional families.\n\nIt's unclear how the recent ruling will affect that effort.\n\nMarriage for family: Angie and Jan Buchanan\n\nAngie and Jan Buchanan are among the many gay parents who have a lot at stake in the outcome.\n\nSuing her wife for joint custody of their adopted son was one of the hardest things Jan Buchanan had ever done.\n\nShe had been with her partner, Angie, for 13 years. They had celebrated their union with a religious wedding more than a decade ago. When the two decided to adopt a baby, she even changed her name \"so they sounded more like a family.\"\n\n\"Legally, only one of us could adopt him so we actually had to sue one another in order to both have rights,\" said Jan Buchanan, 38.\n\nThe day of Cogburn's ruling, the Buchanans, of Arden, camped out at the Register of Deeds Office for more than five hours waiting for the judgment.\n\nHaving been declined for a marriage license at that very spot several times, the two came prepared for a ceremony. Joined by two ministers from the Land of Sky United Church of Christ, they wed that day.\n\n\"For us it was about having the rights we needed to protect our family and our son, and to be able to do things like check 'married' on forms,\" said Jan Buchanan. \"In our hearts we have been married for a long time, but every time we had to fill out a form, we had to check 'single.' That just didn't feel right.\"\n\nMarriage for equality: Bob Carver and John Griffin\n\nThere are lots of reasons why after 33 years of committed love, Bob Carver and John Griffin got married Friday. The least of which was just because they could.\n\n\"When you are told for so long that you cannot do something, that someone doesn't approve of your lifestyle, or that a certain part of society doesn't agree with you, a small part of you wants to show the world otherwise,\" said Carver, 59.\n\nOwners of their own catering company, the Fairview couple watched countless weddings. \"It was hard not to think, why that can't be us?\" he said.\n\nOver the years, the two fostered more than 200 kids. But, when they decided they wanted to be parents themselves, even the social worker who was helping them told them they'd never be approved.\n\n\"There was just so much stigma surrounding two gay men trying to adopt,\" said Griffin, 60, whose face lit up as talked about the two boys they were eventually able to adopt, and the grandchildren they are soon expecting.\n\nA legal marriage brings security and protection to our growing family, Carver said, looking over at his husband. Both graying and squinting behind glasses, the two men worry about keeping each other safe as they move past middle age.\n\nLegal status as a married couple will give each greater control over the other's care.\n\nGriffin has experienced a host of health problem in the last few years, including a broken hip and a heart attack. On Tuesday, he went into emergency surgery for an appendectomy.\n\n\"Before, when he was sick, I always felt powerless,\" Carver said. \"Now, those days are over.\"\n\nMarriage for protection: Patrick Stewart and Tom Jessie\n\nWhen the pastor at their impromptu ceremony Tuesday afternoon talked about staying together for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, all that was going through Patrick Stewart's mind was: \"Been there, done that.\"\n\nAfter 31 years in a committed relationship, Stewart, 63, and his husband, Tom Jessie, 74, say they are headed into the final chapter of their lives.\n\n\"We decided to get married 29 years ago,\" said Jessie. \"We had already made a lifetime commitment. It's just that we couldn't, up until now, do what everybody else does.\"\n\nLike Carver and Griffin, the two say marriage brings a host of legal protections and relief to their union. Over and over again, they have watched as their aging friends struggle when one partner dies or becomes sick.\n\n\"When you are older, you start thinking about all of this,\" said Stewart, a retired interior designer and home improvement consultant, who now spends his time puttering around the couple's Polk County farm. \"You know you're not going to live forever, and you want to get things organized.\"\n\nWithout the legal distinction of marriage, a host of things can happen, such as the loss of property, inheritance, or medical and end-of life decisions being made without consulting one's partner, Jessie said. \"Just like any couple, we want to be able to determine how our lives and deaths are going to be handled.\"\n\nWhile their pending nuptials weren't a surprise, the fact they could get married as quickly as they did was a bit shocking. The two had just purchased airline tickets to return to the Chicago suburbs where they met in order to make their union legal.\n\n\"This was much better,\" said Stewart, of their unplanned ceremony at the Register of Deeds Office. \"We were able to cancel our flight.\"\n\nMarriage for future generations: Cathy McGaughey and Diane Ansley\n\nStewart and Jessie weren't the only ones taken aback by the pace in which marriage legalization progressed. Cathy McGaughey and Diane Ansley were sitting in their old, gray Nissan pulling a travel trailer through downtown Charleston when the news hit that same-sex marriage was legal.\n\nPartners of almost 15 years, the Fort Worth couple had spent all day Thursday lingering at the Register of Deeds Office waiting to be married. When no ruling was made, they returned Friday.\n\nUnfortunately, the two couldn't stay long. Their daughter was celebrating her birthday and college graduation over the weekend, and they had to head south. Plus, the two plaintiffs in the Cogburn case were still doubtful a ruling would be made before Monday.\n\n\"God has a major sense of humor,\" said McGaughey, 54, as she recalled how the longtime social issues activists heard the news over the radio. \"We just started crying. We were so happy. We were just sitting there in the traffic jam crying. It was surreal.\"\n\nAs children of the South, neither thought they'd live to see the day when same-sex marriage was legal in North Carolina. Through they had often thought about going to another state to get married, McGaughey, an Asheville native, always dreamed of a wedding in her hometown at the church where her mother and father said their vows.\n\n\"Suddenly, that was a reality,\" gushed McGaughey over the phone, two days after their Tuesday ceremony in front of friends and news cameras.\n\n\"Suddenly, we could actually do this. It felt like a historical time. For us, for future generations, for kids like our daughter, getting married was something meaningful we could fight for.\"\n\nThe work ahead: The Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara\n\nA relentless battle is something LGBT activists are prepared to fight, said the Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, an Asheville-based minister, longtime community organizer and advocate for LGBT rights.\n\nBorn and raised to a religious family in Chapel Hill, Beach-Ferrara said her 20s was a period of learning.\n\nA graduate of Brown University, Warren Wilson College and the Harvard Divinity School, she logged hundreds of hours studying civil rights, campaign strategy, equality policy and the role of religion in social movements.\n\nStruggling to come to terms with her relationship with the church, the young lesbian sought spiritual growth working in the community. She volunteered at an HIV/AIDS hospice and taught at a prison. She first came to Asheville to live in 2002.\n\nThe mountain town changed her life. It was here she was exposed to other gay clergy and found a way to bring organized religion back to her day-to-day existence. She also met her soon to be wife, Meghann Burke.\n\nIn 2007, the two moved to Massachusetts for graduate school, but came back three years later as a newly-married lawyer and ordained minister prepared to work.\n\n\"There is an immediate and urgent need here,\" said Beach-Ferrara, 39, who is now the executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality and a pastor at the First Congregational United Church of Christ.\n\nStudies have shown that one half of all LGBT Americans live in the South, yet the South still has the most robust discrimination and the least resources, she said. In most of the South, same-sex marriage is still illegal. People still get fired for being gay.\n\nBeach-Ferrara points to the time when she and Burke returned to Asheville. \"In a way, by coming home, we were giving up some legal protections,\" she said. \"Until Friday, our marriage was not recognized by the state of North Carolina.\"\n\nThe couple's vulnerability increased three months ago when Burke, 34, a civil and criminal litigation attorney at Cogburn & Brazil PA, gave birth to a baby boy. Like many LGBT couples, the two struggled to achieve equal custody, Beach-Ferrara said.\n\n\"Even with a wife for a lawyer it was troublesome,\" she added. \"Experiences like that really crystallize what discrimination looks like.\"\n\nCampaign for Southern Equality will continue to fight until there is equality in all 50 states, said Beach-Ferrara.\n\nThe youth, especially, are struggling to survive, she continued. Statistics repeatedly show that LGBT teenagers are at increased risk for drug and alcohol abuse, bullying and suicide.\n\n\"We want them to know that people are fighting for their equality and that they can envision a safe future,\" said Beach-Ferrara. \"We want them to know, whatever their dreams are, their dreams don't have to be constrained.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/westchester/mount-pleasant/2019/07/25/diane-schuler-taconic-state-parkway-crash/1769219001/", "title": "2009 Taconic State Parkway crash, 10 years later", "text": "The red Ford minivan hurtled down the fast lane of the northbound Taconic State Parkway in Mount Pleasant — but it wasn't going north.\n\nDiane Schuler, a 36-year-old Long Island mother of two, was at the wheel, drunk and high, headed south at 70 mph.\n\nOn that bright sunny Sunday 10 years ago, July 26, 2009, families were shattered in a fiery crash that killed eight, including four girls, ages 2 to 8.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS: A TACONIC CRASH TIMELINE: Tracing Diane Schuler's final hours\n\nHEADLIGHTS HEADING YOUR WAY: What to do when faced with a wrong-way driver\n\nAt the time, the crash was the deadliest on a Westchester roadway in 75 years. Ten years later, nothing has happened to change that distinction.\n\nThere have been more wrong-way incidents in the decade since and, while the Taconic tragedy is still the deadliest, it still bears hallmarks of most wrong-way crashes: They are rare, they are often deadly and they are often fueled by alcohol.\n\nNobody could stop her\n\nDiane Schuler was driving back from a weekend at a Sullivan County campground.\n\nThe Cablevision executive and PTA mom, who by all appearances lived a happy life, had a lot in her system that day: the equivalent of 10 drinks, and marijuana that the coroner said had been smoked within an hour of her death.\n\nWitnesses on the Taconic said she was driving \"pin straight\" at 70 mph in the fast lane, not swerving.\n\nSchuler was not alone in that van, driving back to Long Island. With her were her children: Bryan, 5, and Erin, 2. And her brother’s kids: Emma Hance, 8; Alyson Hance, 7; and Katie Hance, 5.\n\nShe wasn’t alone on the Taconic, either. Frantic drivers flooded 911 dispatchers with reports of a red minivan heading the wrong way down the parkway. They had tried to stop her, they told investigators. They had honked their horns and flashed their lights.\n\nNothing worked.\n\nSchuler drove nearly two miles in the wrong direction until, at 1:35 p.m., she hit a SUV driven by Guy Bastardi of Yonkers. He and his dad, Michael, and their family friend, Daniel Longo, were heading to Yorktown Heights for a family Sunday pasta dinner with family.\n\nThey did not make it.\n\nThe impact killed the Bastardis and Longo, Schuler and her daughter, and all three Hance sisters. The only survivor was 5-year-old Bryan Schuler, who sustained a severe brain injury.\n\nWitnesses flew into action to pull Schuler and the kids from the burning van, which had rolled over as it went down an embankment onto a grassy median. It wasn't until days later that the toxicology report's stunning results were known.\n\nThe Taconic wrong-way crash has been the subject of two books, true-crime podcasts and a 2011 HBO documentary that drew its title from the chilling words of 8-year-old Emma Hance: \"There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane,\" who had expressed concern about her aunt's condition in a cellphone call to her father shortly before the crash.\n\nIn the documentary, Schuler's husband steadfastly denied that his wife was capable of such poor decision-making, that she rarely drank and even more rarely smoked marijuana. There had to be another explanation, he said: a stroke triggered by a tooth abscess, perhaps.\n\nThere were lawsuits and later, sealed settlements against Schuler's estate.\n\nWestchester's worst accident\n\nThe anniversary of Westchester County's worst crash raises the question: Are our highways more prone to wrong-way incidents?\n\nNew York State Police Investigator Joseph Becerra said a trooper's accident report doesn't include a \"wrong-way box\" to check, suggesting those accidents are too rare to warrant a designation.\n\nBecerra estimates he has investigated \"probably half a dozen\" wrong-way head-on crashes in his 34 years on the job. All of them, he said, involved alcohol.\n\n\"There were two that came to mind shortly after the Taconic incident where there were wrong-way drivers on the Taconic and both were intoxicated and both were charged with not only driving while intoxicated but also reckless endangerment,\" Becerra said.\n\nThe Taconic crash scene was unforgettable, he said.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of horrific things but because of all the children involved and the amount of fatalities it was one of the worst,\" Becerra said.\n\nA crash like that shines a spotlight on all future wrong-way crashes and arrests, the investigator said.\n\nBecerra, who grew up in Westchester, said he could not say whether the county's roads were more or less susceptible to wrong-way drivers. But he said the Taconic is well-marked.\n\n\"As part of our investigation we went up and down the Taconic and every entrance is clearly marked, with 'do not enter, wrong way,' [signs]\" Becerra said. \"So signage was definitely there.\"\n\nThomas Gleason, commissioner of the Westchester County Department of Public Safety, said he doesn't think the county's roads are more susceptible to wrong-way drivers.\n\n\"Just about every case that we've experienced and that I've seen in 36 years has involved some type of impairment, whether drugs or alcohol,\" he said. \"You can have all the signage you want, but if somebody is that drunk it's not going to make a difference.\"\n\nRecent wrong-way drivers\n\nIn the past 11 months, there have been at least a half-dozen wrong-way incidents on local roadways —with no fatalities.\n\nThe incidents range from a New York City woman who drove the wrong way while drunk on the Sprain in Greenburgh in April to a White Plains man with a blood-alcohol level at 0.22% — nearly three times the legal limit — arrested in Ardsley last September after driving north on the soutbound New York State Thruway.\n\nGleason said that several factors can reduce the number of fatalities in wrong-way incidents.\n\nMost often, people are driving impaired late at night, sharing the road with fewer cars, he said. And police have more help these days.\n\n\"With everybody basically having a cellphone, if someone spots it they're going to call immediately and hopefully we can get there and get to the person and intercept them,\" he said.\n\nTalk of wrong-way drivers takes Gleason back to his first training officer who taught the new cop a valuable lesson.\n\n\"He said, 'Kid, when you're driving on the parkway on the midnight tour, especially, and there's nobody on the road you driving up and down the parkway there's no need to be flying up and down in the left lane.' He said 'Stay in the right lane because chances are if somebody is driving impaired the wrong way they're going to be coming at you in the left lane because they think they're in the right lane because they don't know they're on the wrong side of the road.'\"\n\nGleason said within a few years, he survived two \"scary moments,\" when wrong-way drunks passed him in the left lane on the Hutch and the Cross-County.\n\nRare, deadly, drunken\n\nA 2012 special investigation from the National Transportation Safety Board looked at wrong-way collisions.\n\n\"Wrong-way collisions occur relatively infrequently, accounting for only about 3 percent of accidents on high-speed divided highways,\" the report's authors wrote. \"But they are much more likely to result in fatal and serious injuries than are other types of highway accidents.\"\n\nThere's a simple reason for that: \"The vast majority of wrong-way collisions\" are head-on, the NTSB noted.\n\nStill, the number of deaths attributed annually to wrong-way crashes has fluctuated little; it is typically between 300 and 400.\n\nThe NTSB reported that, from 2004 to 2009, there were:\n\n218,813 fatal crashes in the U.S.;\n\n54,789 fatal crashes on divided highways;\n\n1,566 wrong-way fatal crashes on divided highways;\n\n2,139 wrong way crash fatalities.\n\nThe report bore out what Becerra and Gleason have found in their years on their respective police forces: Wrong-way crashes more often than not involve alcohol.\n\nThe NTSB report concluded that \"driving while impaired by alcohol is the primary cause of wrong-way driving collisions.\"\n\nOf the 1,566 wrong-way fatal crashes in the six years covered by the 2012 report, 936 of them — 60 percent — \"had indications of alcohol involvement.\" Nearly 60 percent of the cases involving alcohol had drivers with blood-alcohol levels at 0.15% or higher.\n\nIn New York, the level for intoxicated driving is 0.08%.\n\nSchuler's level was 0.19%.\n\nAccording to the Alcohol Help Center, at 0.15%, gross motor skills are impaired. A cellphone screen would appear blurry and judgment and perception would be severely impaired. Any high is replaced by agitation or depression.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION SALE: Get unlimited access to lohud for one low annual fee\n\nRead the 2012 NTSB Highway Special Investigation Report on Wrong-Way Driving", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/us/uvalde-school-police-pete-arredondo/index.html", "title": "Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo fired in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Uvalde school board voted unanimously Wednesday evening to immediately terminate the contract of district police chief Pete Arredondo, three months after a teenaged gunman took the lives of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary.\n\nLieutenant Mike Hernandez will remain interim police chief, the school district’s board of trustees said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe school board made its decision in a closed session meeting lasting nearly an hour-and-a-half. Several members of the audience applauded after the decision was announced. One person was heard repeatedly shouting: “We’re not done.”\n\nArredondo didn’t attend the meeting. His attorney instead issued a 17-page press statement that said the district wasn’t following legal procedure as it moved to fire Arredondo and that the police chief was concerned about his safety.\n\nIn the statement, which came less than an hour before the meeting started, Arredondo’s attorney George Hyde argued that a letter from the district suspending him without pay does not count as an official “complaint” required by law to consider termination.\n\n“Chief Arredondo will not participate in his own illegal and unconstitutional public lynching and respectfully requests the Board immediately reinstate him, with all backpay and benefits and close the complaint as unfounded,” the statement concludes.\n\nHyde said due to death threats, Arredondo didn’t feel the board meeting would be safe.\n\nThe meeting began with comments from members of the public, some of whom called for Arredondo, who had been on unpaid leave, and other officers who responded to turn in their badges.\n\nThe board members said Texas law requires for the hearing on the chief’s employment status to be held in closed session. Upon returning from that private meeting, a board member read a motion to terminate Arredondo’s non-certified contract immediately and another to ratify his leave status.\n\nArredondo has come under intense public scrutiny over the law enforcement response to the May 24 massacre, America’s deadliest school shooting since 2012.\n\nAP/Getty Images\n\nUvalde schools superintendent Hal Harrell had recommended that Arredondo be fired. State officials identified Arredondo as the on-scene police commander, though he has said he did not consider himself in charge.\n\nThe attacker remained in two adjoined classrooms for more than an hour before officers entered the rooms and killed him, authorities say. The delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that call for police to immediately stop the threat and came even as children inside repeatedly called 911 and begged for help.\n\nIn his statement for Arredondo, Hyde says the chief was not notified between June 22 and July 19 of a school district investigation and was not asked to participate or give a statement.\n\n“The district cannot withhold its information for months, present only that which they find supports the Superintendent, and then disclose it without a reasonable opportunity to review it, and the opportunity to discover impeachment or optional completeness evidence.”\n\nWednesday’s meeting comes after heated school board sessions in which parents have demanded that Arredondo and others in the school system be fired, and after several instances in which officials have criticized the police response to the shooting in hearings and a Texas House investigative report.\n\nReport described ‘lackadaisical approach’ by law enforcement\n\nIn a hearing before the Texas Senate on June 21, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety called the police response an “abject failure.” The director, Col. Steven McCraw, placed blame for the failure on Arredondo. The on-scene commander, McCraw said, was “the only thing” stopping officers from entering the classrooms to engage the gunman.\n\nBut Arredondo told a Texas House investigative committee that he did not consider himself the incident commander – echoing comments he made to the Texas Tribune in June.\n\nIn a preliminary report released July 17, the Texas House panel placed blame more broadly, outlining a series of failures by multiple law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe 77-page report described “an overall lackadaisical approach” by the 376 local, state and federal law enforcement officers who responded and were at the school.\n\n“There is no one to whom we can attribute malice or ill motives,” the report says. “Instead, we found systemic failures and egregious poor decision making.”\n\nThe report also notes others could have assumed command. Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training “teaches that any law enforcement officer can assume command, that somebody must assume command, and that an incident commander can transfer responsibility as an incident develops,” it says.\n\n“That did not happen at Robb Elementary, and the lack of effective incident command is a major factor that caused other vital measures to be left undone,” according to the report.\n\nIn that report, Arredondo said his approach was “responding as a police officer,” and that he therefore “didn’t title myself.”\n\nHowever, at least one of the responding officers expressed the belief that Arredondo was leading the law enforcement response inside the school, telling others that the “chief is in charge,” according to a timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nHyde said in Wednesday’s media statement that Arredondo was “brave, led other officers in saving lives, and took all reasonable actions to prevent further injuries or loss of life, as the Active Shooter protocol demands.”\n\nThe attorney repeated Arredondo’s claim he was just a responding officer and said that because the gunman’s criminal actions began off campus, in another jurisdiction, the obligation for an incident commander fell on other law enforcement agencies.\n\nHe also wrote that the chief warned the district for more than a year about the school district’s vulnerability to a gunman.\n\nIn the wake of sharp criticism following the mass shooting, Uvalde school district Superintendent Hal Harrell placed Arredondo – who has been the school district police chief since March 2020 – on leave from his position as school police chief on June 22.\n\nSeparately, Arredondo resigned his position on the Uvalde City Council in early July, and the council accepted the resignation July 12.\n\n‘Too little, too late’\n\nAt a school board meeting July 18 – a day after the House report was released – an uncle of one of the slain children angrily asked why Arredondo still was employed.\n\n“Why the hell does he still have a job with y’all?” Brett Cross, an uncle of 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia, asked the board, adding he wanted members to resign if Arredondo weren’t fired by the next day. “Because you all do not give a damn about our children or us. Stand with us or against us, because we ain’t going nowhere.”\n\nFiring Arredondo now, Cross told CNN later that week, would be “too little, too late.” Cross, who had been raising Uziyah as his son before the child was killed in the shooting, and some others in the community have been calling for the superintendent, the board and the school police department to be replaced.\n\nAt a meeting Monday night, the school board met to review parents’ complaints calling for the superintendent’s removal. The board passed a motion that, in part, requires the superintendent to provide to the board names or organizations that could review the district’s administrative practices about accountability.\n\nSome community members in attendance – including Cross – expressed anger at the end of the meeting, with some saying that it took three hours to not accomplish anything.\n\n“Come out Wednesday,” Cross said as he and others left Monday’s meeting. “I’m f**king tired of this bulls**t.”", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Steve Almasy", "Jason Hanna", "Steve Almasy"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/08/county-council-settles-employee-who-raised-harassment-allegations/913581001/", "title": "NCCo Council has settled with an employee who alleged harassment", "text": "A secret investigation. Alleged workplace harassment. Dueling cries of character assassination. Behavior coaching for New Castle County Council President Karen Hartley-Nagle.\n\n\n\nThese issues have gripped New Castle County Council through most of 2017 –– a drama that cost taxpayers about $135,000, invoices obtained by The News Journal show.\n\nThe investigation into claims of workplace harassment against Hartley-Nagle by her former administrative assistant, Kate Maxwell, resulted in a settlement. Maxwell got $20,000 in pay while on leave for five months, and another $48,000 in the final settlement to drop her claim and waive any further liability.\n\nAnother $67,000 was spent on the investigation.\n\nIt started after Hartley-Nagle took office in late 2016, when council members began to receive teary-eyed reports from Maxwell about how her boss had allegedly harassed her and created a hostile workplace. In May, Maxwell was placed on leave.\n\n“We were seeing Kate in tears most days we were in there,” said Councilwoman Janet Kilpatrick, who chairs the Personnel Committee, which has been meeting for months behind closed doors, seeking a solution to the complaint.\n\nSTORY:How long have we been drinking tainted water?\n\nCounty council agreed to have an outside human resources expert and an attorney investigate the claims. Council forbade Hartley-Nagle from supervising council employees.\n\nAnd council staff were banned from speaking with the president unless the conversation occurred in public with at least two other people present, Kilpatrick told council aides in an email, noting that the action was made by \"the majority of council.\" That note was reviewed by The News Journal.\n\nHartley-Nagle is now required by council to complete behavior coaching before she can supervise another council employee, multiple county officials confirmed to The News Journal.\n\nOPINION:Don't keep residents in the dark about polluted wells: Editorial\n\nIn correspondence to the council, and in a written statement to The News Journal, Hartley-Nagle’s attorney Sid Liebesman called Maxwell's complaint a \"baseless defensive stunt\" used to smear his client's character.\n\nIn correspondence, Liebesman questioned Maxwell's credibility because of a criminal conviction in Arizona nearly a decade ago –– and discrepancies on the resume she submitted for employment with the county.\n\nLiebesman told council and investigators that the appropriate thing to do was fire Maxwell, because she had not been truthful on her employment application, correspondence reviewed by The News Journal shows.\n\n\n\n\"The findings of the grossly one-sided investigation are unfounded, and the so-called remedial measures sought are unprecedented and intended to cause further political harm,\" said Liebesman.\n\nThe News Journal filed a Freedom of Information request to learn precisely what happened between Maxwell and Hartley-Nagle, but it was denied because the issue was a \"personnel matter.\" Until recently, county officials refused to discuss the issue on the record, and the investigative report remains secret.\n\nAfter conferring with County Council Attorney Mike Migliore, Kilpatrick summarized her interpretation of the investigation: \"The conclusion was that there was enough evidence to support that the council environment in which Kate was exposed included harassment, insulting and demeaning treatment.\"\n\nIn accepting the deal, Maxwell waived any claims against county officials. The settlement also states County Council is not liable in the dispute.\n\n\n\n\"It is a screwed up mess all the way around,\" said Councilman Bill Powers.\n\nKilpatrick defended the outcome.\n\n\n\n\"There was nothing politically motivated here,\" Kilpatrick insisted. \"This was for the protection of the employees that are in that office now and maybe in that office in the future.\"\n\nMaxwell did not return multiple phone calls and messages seeking comment.\n\nIn August, she spoke to The News Journal about the work environment under Hartley-Nagle but declined to discuss specifics because the investigation was still pending, she said at the time.\n\n“The environment I worked in I would not wish for anybody,” Maxwell said in August. “It was very hostile and combative.\"\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nNCCo Council president under internal investigation while assistant in legal limbo\n\nNCCo Council takes vote after Hartley-Nagle investigation\n\nMaxwell is a single mother of two and the daughter of well-known political figure Bob Maxwell, the county's former chief administrative officer and a lobbyist who represents New Castle County government and other Delaware counties. Maxwell's late boyfriend was Christopher Leach, one of three Wilmington firefighters killed in September 2016 while responding to a row house fire.\n\nThe investigation\n\nKilpatrick said council tried to mitigate the cost of the issue by having County Executive Matt Meyer's administration handle the investigation with county employees, rather than hiring outside experts.\n\nOfficials in Meyer's administration declined to investigate, however, explaining it was council's problem –– not an executive branch issue.\n\nCounty Council paid Middletown human resources expert, Patricia M. Clendening, about $11,000 to investigate the claims. Council has also received bills from Wilmington law firm Potter, Anderson & Carroon totaling $56,000 for investigative legal services through October, according to invoices received through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nCouncil continues to incur expenses for the law firm's services.\n\nKilpatrick maintains council was obligated by county work rules to start an investigation once officials began receiving teary-eyed reports of mistreatment.\n\n\"We looked through our handbook. It says when we believe there is a problem we have to take action,\" Kilpatrick said.\n\nAmong other types of harassment, County Council's rules bar behavior that creates a \"hostile, abusive or offensive work environment and/or which has the effect of interfering with an individual's work performance.\"\n\nKilpatrick declined to discuss specific evidence in the report or identify which rule Hartley-Nagle is alleged to have broken. She, along with other council officials and employees, said they cannot speak about the personnel matter.\n\nKilpatrick did recount one instance where Maxwell allegedly told her that she had been barred by Hartley-Nagle from speaking to anyone on the eighth floor of the City/County Building in downtown Wilmington where County Council's offices are located.\n\nSTORY: County at crossroads in Three Little Bakers golf course lawsuit\n\nSTORY: Dirty job: Divers find $10 million problem in county sewers\n\nShe said other employees also reported hearing Maxwell being reprimanded by Hartley-Nagle behind closed doors, and at least one person felt the tension was escalating, she said.\n\n\"Every time she would be reprimanded, she would have a job taken away from her,\" Kilpatrick said. \"Kate is not dumb. She knew she was probably going to end up having Karen fire her or say she was not doing her job.\"\n\nKilpatrick said Clendening's investigation took place over two months and involved interviews with 27 people. It is unclear how many people corroborated the claims.\n\nIn addition to Maxwell's statements, Kilpatrick said, the evidence was the testimony of those who overheard interactions between the president and Maxwell. Kilpatrick said the investigation also included a nearly five-hour interview with Hartley-Nagle.\n\nCouncilman Penrose Hollins said he was interviewed, did not personally observe any of the alleged treatment and defended the process.\n\n\"There were incidents that did occur,\" Hollins said. \"There was an investigation, and the investigation was completed by an independent investigator.\"\n\nCouncilman David Tackett said he never observed any untoward behavior, but noted his office is on the other end of the floor from Hartley-Nagle's.\n\n\"To reach a conclusion, I was comfortable taking the advice of counsel,\" Tackett said, declining further comment.\n\nNot everybody was comfortable with the result of the investigation. Powers walked out of the closed-door presentation of the report. He said he doesn't know if Maxwell's claims have merit but said the evidence made him uncomfortable.\n\n\"I said, 'This doesn't seem right. What you are saying is more or less, 'He said, she said,' so I walked out,\" Powers said.\n\nLiebesman was far more blunt in a statement to The News Journal.\n\nThe harassment claim came only after Maxwell \"got wind she may be fired as a result of her poor work product and poor work habits,\" he wrote.\n\nKilpatrick said nobody raised the issue with Maxwell's work performance until the investigation began, adding that she has seen nothing to suggest Maxwell's work was below par.\n\nFiring a council aide requires a supermajority vote of the council. Hartley-Nagle never moved to terminate Maxwell.\n\nLiebesman said he still doesn't know which council members voted for or against Hartley-Nagle. While his client was the focus of the investigation, County Council has yet to present him a copy of the report.\n\nLegal minefield\n\nLiebesman maintains Hartley-Nagle's innocence and attacked Maxwell's credibility.\n\n“The investigation was not only politically motivated and rigged from the outset, the complainant is a convicted felon who was incarcerated after admitting to having embezzled substantial sums of money from two former employers,\" Liebesman wrote, declining to answer questions.\n\nIn August, Liebesman forwarded to Migliore copies of court records showing Maxwell's criminal conviction in Arizona, Kilpatrick and Migliore confirmed. The News Journal independently secured the records.\n\nAccording to court documents filed in Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona, Maxwell pleaded guilty to one count of fraud in 2008 after being accused of embezzling more than $26,000 from a resort she worked at between 2005 and 2006.\n\nCourt records show she was sentenced to three months in jail, and ordered to pay $47,000 in restitution to the Scottsdale resort and its insurer –– as well as another area golf club Maxwell admitted to pilfering money from.\n\nKilpatrick said she had not read the documents, but told County Council members debating Maxwell's situation that the documents had been received. She added that the plea has \"nothing to do\" with whether Maxwell was subject to a hostile workplace while employed at the county.\n\nThe investigation was not \"Kate versus Karen\" but \"Karen versus a variety of people\" Kilpatrick said. \"No matter what your background is you are entitled to work in an environment free of harassment.\"\n\nBut Liebesman points to the county handbook which prohibits submitting false or incomplete information in a job application. To do so is grounds for firing, the rules state.\n\n\"If the investigation was truly fair, then the result would have been Ms. Maxwell's termination for resume fraud for lying about the two employers from whom she embezzled substantial money, and about the time she spent in jail during which she claimed to have been employed,\" Liebesman wrote.\n\nCorrespondence reviewed by The News Journal show Liebesman made these allegations to county officials in August –– more than a month before the settlement was signed.\n\nA felony conviction does not preclude a candidate from being considered for employment by the government. It is unclear what documents Maxwell submitted to county officials when she applied for the job late last year, or if they were verified by anyone on County Council at the time.\n\nNellie Hill, clerk of the council, said such documents are confidential.\n\nA statement in the council’s handbook states: “It is the policy of the council to check references and previous employers prior to extending an offer or conditional offer of employment to any applicant.”\n\nSTORY: Political fight ensues after Ogletown park offer rejected\n\nSTORY: Council members block county construction projects\n\nIn an email, Hill said it was Hartley-Nagle's responsibility to vet Maxwell. \"We understand\" Hartley-Nagle did \"check references\" relating to Maxwell, Hill said.\n\nHartley-Nagle, who selected Maxwell as her aide, did not answer questions about how much she knew about the felony plea when Maxwell was hired.\n\nCounty Council members gave different answers as to who is responsible for cross-referencing employment and background information about a job candidate or whether those checks actually occur.\n\nMembers of County Council and council employees said they were not aware of the plea when council voted to ratify Maxwell's hiring in November 2016.\n\nKilpatrick said officials inquired as to who knew what when after receiving the information from Liebesman but declined further comment. She said she did not know about the plea when she voted to ratify Maxwell's hiring.\n\n\"We are currently going through our handbook and something like this makes us more diligent in what our process is,\" Kilpatrick said.\n\nShe accused Liebesman of trotting out 10-year-old information to smear Maxwell. She said firing an employee after a harassment claim would only lead to a lawsuit against the county for retaliation.\n\n\"It opens up a real can of worms,\" Kilpatrick said.\n\nThe settlement document indicates that Maxwell's criminal record did affect the final settlement with the inclusion of a non-disparagement clause, barring the parties from communicating \"information to third parties for the purpose of damaging the other's business standing or reputation\" — a clause Kilpatrick said Liebesman could have broken.\n\n\"Kate did nothing wrong,\" she said of Maxwell's time in county government.\n\nTense times\n\nKilpatrick said that before the Maxwell issue arose, reports of tension between Hartley-Nagle and James Boyle, the council's financial adviser/policy director, led County Council to remove the position from Hartley-Nagle's oversight.\n\n\"There was nothing we could do to protect Kate in a small office because her direct report was to the person who was allegedly harassing her,\" Kilpatrick said.\n\nAlthough Maxwell is out of the picture, tension in county government remains.\n\n\"We have other things we should be doing,\" Hollins said. \"We should not be spending the resources we have here on this.\"\n\nHartley-Nagle's term leading the council began in late 2016. This is her first elected office. She won by promising to usher in reforms of a government then gripped by drama around former County Executive Thomas P. Gordon.\n\nBut throughout her first year in office, efforts to push major legislation has been rebuffed by her colleagues, and she's found herself sparring with council members who she claims are bullying her.\n\nOPINION: Public needs answers from NCCo Council: Editorial\n\n\"We have taken every possible power away from her we can,\" said Councilman Tim Sheldon.\n\nHartley-Nagle and her council colleagues have clashed over her errors officiating at council meetings, her attempts to change a vote she made, and her allegations about receiving harassing emails from Councilman George Smiley.\n\nIn November, Smiley, with a majority vote of the council, took Hartley-Nagle's seat co-chairing the council's Executive Committee. The position carries little-to-no power, but her ouster was an unprecedented maneuver.\n\n\"I consider this a personal attack and a political attack on me,\" Hartley-Nagle said at the time. \"This has been done since I started by Mr. Smiley with legislation to take away powers from my aide (Maxwell), myself.\"\n\nSmiley insisted their differences have been with her effectiveness at the job, not over personal animus.\n\n\"Once you realized you were not responsible for your birth, you have not been responsible for anything since,\" Smiley told Hartley-Nagle during a committee meeting, discussing her ouster as chair. \"You have taken no responsibility.\"\n\nOfficials confirmed the investigation into Maxwell's claims included recommendations for Hartley-Nagle to undergo some sort of workplace behavior training before she can have another aide reporting directly to her. The council has $17,000 budgeted for training expenses, which also covers training for other officials and employees for other purposes.\n\nIt is unclear if Hartley-Nagle is complying with the recommendations. She declined to discuss it.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Read Part 1 and Part 2 for much more on this topic.\n\nD’Ascanio and her uncle, Derrell Ray Pettit Jr., had each inherited half of a one-acre tract just outside West Asheville, with a tax value of $123,600, that had been home to three generations of their family.\n\nBut investors including Robert Perry Tucker II acquired the land and through an exploitive but legal process cut the family out of its fortune, an Asheville Watchdog investigation found. In the end, D’Ascanio got nothing, and Pettit ended up homeless for five months.\n\n“I don’t know what happened,” D’Ascanio, 41, said. “I just know it’s heartbreaking that someone could come in and take away something like that from you.”\n\nTucker, an Asheville attorney, declined repeated requests for comment.\n\nRep. Brian Turner, a Buncombe County Democrat, said what happened to D’Ascanio, “I would liken it to a scam … If this is legal, it shouldn’t be.”\n\n‘How’s that possible?’\n\nThe story of how the family lost its inheritance involves a box of cash, an empty promise and a flawed and easily exploited law that has stripped property and wealth from other mostly poor property owners across the country, as Asheville Watchdog previously reported. Attempts to reform the law, known as a partition or forced sale, with one less prone to abuse have stalled in North Carolina after passing in 19 other states.\n\nInvestors use partition actions to buy properties co-owned by multiple people, usually heirs in a family, at below market value. The law allows any owner to ask the courts to order a property divided or sold, including by public auction.\n\nPartition actions are meant to resolve disputes when one owner of a property wants to sell and the others don’t or can’t agree on a price. Investors find heirs willing to sell, acquire their partial interest, and ask the courts to force a sale of the entire property.\n\nIn D’Ascanio’s case, her uncle said he agreed to sell his half of the property to an investor, believing he could buy it back. But the investor sold it to two others, who took D’Ascanio and her husband to court under the partition law, forced a sale by public auction, and bought the entire parcel for $2,000. After taxes and fees, D’Ascanio’s share came to $0.\n\n“I don’t understand that. … How’s that possible?” D’Ascanio said. “How is that legal?”\n\nChildhood memories\n\nD’Ascanio’s property, originally owned by her grandparents and on land prime for development, had been in her family for more than 50 years.\n\n“On Christmas and Thanksgiving day, grandma and mom always made duck, our favorite,” D’Ascanio said. “We ate sandwiches at the picnic tables, played in the creek, climbed trees and fed the pigs and chickens.”\n\nPettit, her uncle, grew up in one of four trailers on the property and never left.\n\n“I could go and walk the woods in the middle of the night and take you all over the place,” said Pettit, 44. After two deaths in the family, Pettit’s father in 2017 and his sister, D’Ascanio’s mother, in 2018, the property passed to Pettit and his niece.\n\nD’Ascanio, the part-time manager and cook at the Rise ‘n Shine Café in North Asheville, did her best to handle the expenses. Money she had saved to buy a car for her 16-year-old went toward her mother’s funeral. She couldn’t afford a tombstone.\n\nD’Ascanio was tapped out, her uncle unemployed, and they owed $1,615 in overdue property taxes.\n\nThe county foreclosed on the property in 2018, putting the land up for auction. And that’s what brought the investors in. Bidders included an entity represented by Tucker, Michael Kutyana of Asheville and a company registered to Linda and William Fred Alexander of Black Mountain. All had bought and sold real estate around Buncombe County.\n\nD’Ascanio followed the auction, watching bids reach $61,000. She was entitled to half, which she said she planned to split with her siblings. But then the auction abruptly ended. “It was almost finished. I was just waiting for a phone call from the courthouse,” D’Ascanio said. “It all just disappeared.”\n\nBy law, anyone can pay the tax debt on a property, which stops the foreclosure proceedings. And that’s what happened. The auction commissioner, James Ellis, said a lawyer named Peter R. Henry of Arden paid the tax bill and costs.\n\nD’Ascanio had never heard of Henry and had no idea that as a result of deeds recorded the day before, her uncle’s half of the property now belonged to investors. And her half was about to become worthless.\n\nThe investors, Tucker, Kutyana and the Alexanders, did not respond to repeated requests for comment about their roles in the transactions. Henry, who is Tucker’s lawyer and had prepared deeds for the Alexanders in previous deals, said he would look into Asheville Watchdog’s questions and then declined to comment.\n\nDinner and dessert: a box of cash\n\nExploitation of the partition law often begins with an investor obtaining a partial interest in a property from an unsavvy or financially needy owner for less than market value. In D’Ascanio’s case, that person was her uncle.\n\nWhile the tax foreclosure auction was still under way, William Alexander showed up at Pettit’s trailer, Pettit told Asheville Watchdog. Pettit said he had no money but desperately wanted to keep the family land, the only place he had ever lived.\n\nOver dinner at the Bonfire Barbecue in Asheville, Pettit said Alexander presented a cardboard box full of cash — $4,400 in mostly small bills — for Pettit’s interest in the property.\n\nThe amount was significantly less than market value or what Pettit would have received from the tax auction. But, according to Pettit, Alexander told him he could buy the property back in a year. Pettit said he recalled thinking, “This man’s going to help me … from losing my land.”\n\nThe day after the dinner, Pettit said, Alexander and his wife picked him up to sign and notarize documents. But there was a problem: Pettit said he couldn’t find his driver’s license, which any notary would require. The Alexanders, Pettit said, drove him to a Division of Motor Vehicles office, where he obtained a duplicate copy, and then to a UPS Store where he signed a deed to Alexander’s company.\n\n“I said, OK, where’s the (document) that says I’m allowed to get it back?” Pettit said. Linda Alexander used a computer at the UPS Store to “type it up,” Pettit said.\n\nA notarized “Option to Purchase,” signed by William Alexander, gave Pettit a year to buy back his share for $4,400 “plus any and all costs” Alexander incurred. Pettit said he received only the $4,400 in cash; the deed indicates a sale price of $11,000.\n\nPettit said he never had a chance to buy his land back. The same day the deed was recorded, Alexander’s company sold the interest it just bought from Pettit to a Tucker company and Kutyana for $55,000, records indicate. And the next day, Tucker’s company and Kutyana filed a partition action against D’Ascanio and her husband, the owners of the other half, asking the court to order the entire property to be sold.\n\nFour months later, through what University of North Carolina law professor Rick Su called exploitation of the partition law, Tucker’s company and Kutyana owned the whole parcel, and D’Ascanio came away with nothing for her family land.\n\nA rigged system\n\nCourts often order partition sales by public auction, and the way they’re advertised and conducted virtually guarantees a below-market price, according to research by Thomas Mitchell, a law professor at Texas A&M University and principal author of the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, a proposed law for states to help prevent abuses.\n\nFamily members who want to keep a property have limited options. Banks typically decline to accept fractional interests in properties as collateral for loans. Many heirs are cash poor, and as Mitchell puts it, unable “to outbid even a low-ball bidder.”\n\nAdvertising of the auctions typically consists of a legal description of the property in a newspaper — the weekly Weaverville Tribune for D’Ascanio’s land. Many potential bidders do not participate in partition auctions, Mitchell found, because they “never find out about such sales in the first place.”\n\nSome states set a minimum price that must be met. Not North Carolina.\n\nHow partitions work\n\nPartition cases are generally handled by the clerks of court. Once an owner files a partition request, the other owners are notified through a summons and informed that they may seek legal help. A court clerk holds a hearing to determine whether to divide or sell the property.\n\nThe law gives preference to division. Mitchell found in his review of partition cases nationwide that a forced sale of the entire property is considered extreme, but courts routinely order such sales, accepting the investor’s argument that physical division would result in a lower return for the owners than selling the property as a whole.\n\nD’Ascanio said she couldn’t afford a lawyer and didn’t attend the hearing. The court clerk assigned to her case, Johanna Finkelstein, heard only from Tucker’s company and Kutyana, who persuaded Finkelstein that dividing the land was “not practical without destroying the value,” a court order states.\n\nOnce a partition request is approved, the clerk appoints commissioners — three if the property is to be physically divided, or typically one if a sale is ordered. In a partition sale, the role of a commissioner — often a local Realtor, property appraiser or attorney — is “to get the highest and fairest value for the property,” Finkelstein said in an interview.\n\nThe procedural rules for North Carolina clerks handling partition cases say that commissioners appointed to divide a property must be “disinterested” and have “no conflict of interest, either personal or financial, or no relationship with any party, potential witness, or person who stands to benefit from the proposed transactions.” But there are no rules on conflicts of interest for commissioners in partition sales.\n\nFinkelstein appointed Asheville attorney Ile Adaramola to conduct the sale in D’Ascanio’s case. At the time, Finkelstein said, she typically chose a commissioner based on recommendations from the parties involved, a permissible practice under court clerk procedures.\n\nAdaramola already had been the sale commissioner in three other partition actions by Tucker entities, all resulting in his companies buying the properties as the high bidder, records show. In two of those, Henry had requested Adaramola when another commissioner withdrew.\n\nFinkelstein said she did not know when she appointed Adaramola in D’Ascanio’s case that Adaramola was at the same time acting as Henry's monitor in a 2016 North Carolina State Bar disciplinary action against him.\n\nAdaramola was meeting with Henry monthly and overseeing his communication with clients as part of a three-year monitoring agreement the Bar required for Henry to avoid a suspension of his license to practice law.\n\n“One thing that I do now,” Finkelstein said, “is I pick the commissioner and other people who get appointed in these matters to try and avoid any real or appearance of a conflict of interest.”\n\nGoing, going, gone\n\nOn March 25, 2019, Adaramola held an auction on the steps of the Buncombe County Courthouse and sold D’Ascanio’s family land, valued by the county at $123,600, for $2,000.\n\nThe high bidder: Tucker’s company and Kutyana.\n\nAdaramola told Asheville Watchdog her ties to Tucker and Henry had no bearing on the outcome. “A commissioner's role is simply to sell the real property,” she said.\n\nOther buyers likely stayed away, Finkelstein said, because Tucker’s company, Kutyana and Kutyana’s company had taken out deeds of trust between each other, encumbering their interest in the property with $78,000 in debt. While commercial lenders typically wouldn’t make such loans, private parties are free to lend and borrow money on their own terms.\n\nThe deeds of trust, similar to mortgages, were due by December 2019. There is no default or satisfaction recorded, which is generally filed upon repayment. The property was sold subject to those deeds of trust, meaning the loans would remain in place after the sale.\n\nAsked if Tucker and Kutyana recorded the loans simply to dissuade rival bidders, Finkelstein said, “You can draw your own conclusions.”\n\nAdaramola said she did not recall details of the case and was sympathetic to concerns about exploitation of the law. “As an African American, my community has had land stolen from us,” she said.\n\nBut partition actions are legal, Adaramola said, and “if you're doing what you're supposed to be doing in accordance with the law, you're doing what's legally permissible.”\n\nD’Ascanio was entitled to half of the $2,000 the property generated at auction, but as the law provides, she had to help pay the cost of the partition. After taxes and costs, including her share of $686 to Henry and $500 for Adaramola’s fee, she received nothing.\n\nD’Ascanio could have requested a resale, available to owners when a partition sale generates a low price, but said she didn’t know she could. That recourse is rarely used in Buncombe or elsewhere, Mitchell found.\n\n“We're very limited to only being able to obey what the statute tells us to do,” Finkelstein said.\n\nFinkelstein said Tucker’s company and Kutyana had “a right to a partition.”\n\n“Did it come out to the disadvantage of the D’Ascanios?” she said. “It does appear that way, yes.”\n\nRick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, agreed.\n\n“As for the overall scheme,” Su said, it appears “the intent was to exploit the partition system and the owners.”\n\nThe pain ‘will never go away’\n\nD’Ascanio said she still cries over how her family’s wealth was taken. “It has emotionally hurt my soul,” she said.\n\nIt took her months to pay off her mother’s funeral and buy a tombstone for her grave.\n\n“The pain will never go away from this for my family,” D’Ascanio said. “It is in my thoughts daily, all this time later, and always will be.”\n\nHer uncle, Pettit, said he feels hoodwinked. He held onto that agreement giving him the option to buy back his interest, hoping William Alexander would make good on it.\n\n“I tried to call him and his wife, and neither one of them would answer,” Pettit said.\n\nPettit remained on the property after his lease expired. Tucker and Kutyana went to court and obtained an eviction order. For five months, Pettit said, he was homeless, living in a tent.\n\nPettit sometimes goes by the property. The trailers are gone, and the land has been subdivided for development. There are different owners.\n\nIn November 2020, Tucker’s company and Kutyana sold the property for $137,000.\n\nWhat can be done\n\nThe model reform law, the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, would help prevent abuses in partition sales. Co-owners would have a right of first refusal and 45 days to buy out the interests of those requesting the partition and another 60 days to arrange for financing.\n\nCourts would have to determine fair market value of the property based on an independent appraisal and could only force a sale with evidence that physical division would result in “substantial injury” to all owners. Consideration would be given to noneconomic factors such as whether the property has sentimental, cultural or historic value, or whether one or more owners could be rendered homeless. When a sale is the only option, a real estate broker would be appointed to list the property commercially.\n\nIn North Carolina, the Uniform Act has the support of a coalition of organizations that includes the Conservation Trust for North Carolina, the Black Family Land Trust and the Land Loss Prevention Project. But an influential group, the Conference of Clerks of Superior Court, has raised concerns, including who would pay for the appraisals and other logistics that they say would make partitions more complex and expensive. The clerks contend that the existing system, by allowing for upset bids after an auction, can actually lead to a higher sales price.\n\nCo-sponsored by Rep. Turner of Buncombe, the Uniform Act passed the House with bipartisan support in May. A comparable bill sponsored by two Republicans and a Democrat was filed in the Senate.\n\nAs of early November, the bill was stuck in committee and is not expected to pass this year, despite support from key members of the Republican leadership. “It is essentially dead this year,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield, a Democrat from Asheville. “At this point in the year, we are basically done with bills. … Committees aren’t meeting anymore.”\n\nZach Wallace of Audubon North Carolina, part of the coalition supporting the bill, said legislators had been working to address concerns raised by the court clerks but are now focused on redistricting and the budget.\n\n“This affects folks all across the state, no matter income level, race, geography,” Wallace said. But “things move slow,” he said. “I’ve seen other bills that take multiple sessions to pass.”\n\nIn a Facebook post Nov. 10 urging people to read Asheville Watchdog’s “Equity Erased” series, Turner said he is working to pass the bill in next year’s legislative session.\n\n“For far too long unscrupulous people have been using the partition sales process to cheat people out of the full value of their property,” Turner said. “This has had devastating consequences for too many families in WNC who have seen multi-generational properties, homes, and farms sold for pennies on the dollar.”\n\nBecky Tin contributed to this report.\n\nThis story was originally published by Asheville Watchdog, an independent nonprofit news team serving Asheville and surrounding communities.

Convicted of assaulting a police officer while being arrested, she was placed on probation but never received notice that she’d finished the term and was on safe ground legally. Now 82 and slowed by age, Colvin has asked a judge to end the matter once and for all. She wants a court in Montgomery to wipe away a record that her lawyer said has cast a shadow over the life of a largely unsung hero of the civil rights era. “I am an old woman now. Having my records expunged will mean something to my grandchildren and great grandchildren. And it will mean something for other Black children,” Colvin said in a sworn statement. Supporters sang civil rights anthems and clapped as Colvin entered the clerk’s office and filed the expungement request Tuesday. Her attorney, Phillip Ensler, said he was seeking all legal documents to be sealed and all records of the case erased. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey later said he agreed with the request to clear Colvin’s record, removing any doubt it would be approved. “I guess you can say that now I am no longer a juvenile delinquent,” Colvin told a crowd that included relatives, well-wishers and activists.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is in special session, but it’s quiet at the Capitol, where many legislative offices have been dark, floor sessions in some cases have lasted seconds, and little progress has been made toward resolving the state’s fiscal issues. Since the session started Oct. 4 in Juneau, House committees have had five meetings on fiscal-related topics, all in Anchorage; the Senate has had no such hearings. “I don’t think it’s making a lot of sense to be here doing what we’re doing right now. So if we’re not going to do anything, gavel out,” said Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, one of four House members present last week for a so-called technical floor session held to satisfy a meeting requirement but at which no business is taken up. Outside the first day, there has been one regular floor session. That was in the House, and after bill introductions, much of the time was spent on speeches, some memorializing people who died recently, others on topics like COVID-19 vaccines. There has been interest in finding a long-term solution to a yearly, divisive fight over what size dividend to pay residents from the state’s oil wealth. A legislative working group recommended a constitutional guarantee of a dividend as part of a package with elements including new revenue, budget reductions and a revised spending limit. The recommendations weren’t binding.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Activists protested outside a wedding where U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema was officiating over the weekend – the latest confrontation between demonstrators and the Arizona Democrat who opposes key parts of President Joe Biden’s social services and climate change package. A video posted to YouTube shows the bride’s mother tearfully pleading with protesters not to disrupt her daughter’s wedding, which was held at an outdoor venue separated by a wall from a public street in Bisbee, Arizona. Several demonstrators yell at the mother until one peacemaker suggests they walk quietly with their signs so the wedding can begin. At one point, the bride says: “Thanks for ruining my wedding. I really appreciate it.” Among the costumed guests at the wedding were people wearing Native American costumes with a headdress and face paint. “While the Senator knows the bride and groom, she does not know and did not interact with the wedding guests who wore disrespectful and racist costumes to the ceremony, and she strongly condemns such behavior,” Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said in an email to the Arizona Daily Star. Sinema has faced mounting pressure from Democratic activists over her refusal to eliminate the filibuster and her work to scale back a spending package that started at $3.5 trillion.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Meatpacking giant Tyson Foods says more than 96% of its workers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 ahead of the company’s Nov. 1 deadline for them to do so. The Springdale-based company said the number of its 120,000 workers who have been inoculated has nearly doubled since it announced its mandate Aug. 3, when just 50% of Tyson employees had gotten their shots. “This is an incredible result – not only for our company, but for your families and our communities across the country, ” Tyson President and CEO Donnie King said in a note to employees Tuesday. Tyson, which has long been dealing with worker shortages, said employees who don’t get vaccinated before the company’s deadline will be fired, but the former employees will be welcomed back if they do get inoculated later. “Our doors are open,” King wrote. Spokesman Gary Mickelson said very few employees had left the company over the mandate. The industry was hit hard by the pandemic in spring 2020 when the coronavirus tore through meatpacking plants and forced many to close temporarily because so many workers became ill or had to quarantine. King said Tyson saw a significant decline in virus cases in its workforce as more employees got vaccinated. Tyson remains the only major company in the meatpacking industry to require vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: In an effort to ease congestion at the nation’s busiest port complex, officials said Monday that they will start fining shipping companies whose cargo containers linger for too long at marine terminals. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach said in a statement that arriving containers scheduled to be moved by trucks will be allowed to stay for nine days before fines start accruing. Containers set to move by rail can stay at the ports for three days. After that, ocean carriers will be charged $100 per container, increasing in $100 increments per container per day, the statement said. The new rules will go into effect Nov. 1. “The terminals are running out of space, and this will make room for the containers sitting on those ships at anchor,” Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero said in the statement. It’s the latest step aimed at relieving the logjam of cargo ships that has interrupted the global supply chain. The backlog prompted the Biden administration to allow the port complex to operate 24 hours a day to try to get goods unloaded and out to consumers. About 40% of all shipping containers entering the U.S. come through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: After spending hours looking for a hiker who was unknowingly the subject of a search and rescue effort, a search team is urging people who are late in returning from the outdoors to answer their phones if they get repeated calls from an unknown number. According to the Lake County team, it made multiple unsuccessful attempts via cellphone to reach a person reported overdue from a hike on Mount Elbert on Oct. 18, leading rescuers to launch a search that night. Not long after rescuers resumed their search around daybreak the following day, the overdue hiker, who was not identified, was independently able to find a way off the mountain, the state’s tallest, and drive back to a lodging site, the team said in a Facebook post Thursday. The person who reported the hiker overdue notified authorities. The team said one takeaway was that the “subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didn’t recognize the number.” However, in response to questions from commenters, one team member acknowledged that it was not known if the hiker had the phone’s ringer and notifications turned off. The member said the team also sent texts to the hiker.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former marina owner was sentenced Monday to two years of probation and fined $45,000 for intentionally sinking abandoned boats in Long Island Sound. John Magness, 72, of Bristol, Maine, pleaded guilty last November to a federal charge of obstructing navigable waters by sinking a vessel. Magness was in the process of selling the Bluefish Cove Marina in Bridgeport in 2018 when he made a deal with an employee and another man to scuttle several sailboats and motorboats that had been abandoned at the marina, prosecutors said. Investigators discovered that at least five boats were sunk between Black Rock Harbor and the Pennfield Reef Lighthouse at Magness’ request between October 2018 and April 2019, prosecutors said. The two other men involved, Peter Albrecht, of Norwalk, and Carlos Santos, of Westbrook, each previously pleaded guilty to the same charge and were each sentenced to a year of probation. Prosecutors said Magness agreed to forgive Santos’ unpaid dockage fees in exchange for his help sinking the vessels.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The death of an 18-year-old who was shot Sunday night marked a grim milestone for the city, bringing the total number of people killed by gunfire this year up to the level for all of 2017, Wilmington’s deadliest year on record. The teen, whom police identified Tuesday as Zion Davis-Shelton, was the 32nd person to die by gunfire this year in Wilmington, according to police. In 2017, the city’s deadliest year for gunfire, 35 homicides were recorded – one by stabbing and two by drowning. While the total number of people shot so far this year, 133, is down from 2017, which saw a total of 197 shot, 2021 is on track to be a deadlier year for gunfire. In a statement, Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy in part blamed the number of illegal guns on the street for the violence. Already this year, he said, his officers have made more than 250 gun arrests, “on pace with last year’s record-breaking numbers and leaps and bounds over the totals we saw in years past.” Mayor Mike Purzycki said in a statement that he grieves for the victims’ families and that the two young men killed over the weekend – another 18-year-old was fatally shot about a day before Davis-Shelton – “are a grim reminder that while so much good is taking place in the city, there is too much isolation from healthy societal norms among our young men.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A coyote was recently spotted on a wildlife camera in Rock Creek Park, WUSA-TV reports. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo posted an image of the female coyote on its Facebook page, saying it was part of the Snapshot USA project, a nationwide study using camera traps in suburban, rural, wild and urban areas across all 50 states. The zoo said conservation biologist Tremie Greogry would upload images into the Wildlife Insights database, which is the world’s largest camera trap database. Anyone can upload analyze and share camera trap photos with the conservation community in order to sample mammal populations. The Smithsonian Zoo said the eastern coyote captured in the photo is a recent arrival to Rock Creek, migrating to the area around 2016. The National Park Service has said the first recorded sighting of a coyote in the park was in May 2004. Last year, a coyote was spotted on the National Mall, and another coyote had to be killed after it attacked three people in the Rockville area.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s surgeon general said that conversations while wearing masks aren’t productive and that he offered to meet elsewhere when a state senator didn’t let him in her office without a mask, citing a serious health condition. Dr. Joseph Ladapo said in a statement released Tuesday that he offered to meet outside or in a hallway for his scheduled meeting last week with Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky. He said he doesn’t believe he can communicate clearly and effectively while wearing a mask. Polsky was not satisfied, he said. “Having a conversation with someone while wearing a mask is not something I find productive, especially when other options exist,” Ladapo said in a statement posted on Twitter. The incident drew broad attention over the weekend after Polsky revealed that she had breast cancer, though at the time of the meeting last Wednesday she hadn’t disclosed that publicly and told Lapado only that she had a serious health condition. Ladapo said in his statement that he’s “saddened” by that news and wished her “blessings and strength.” Polsky said in a statement that Ladapo’s excuse for not wanting to wear a mask was “absurd” and “insulting.” She said that after the meeting was abruptly canceled, Ladapo was heard saying to his aides that he was “having fun” arguing with the senator.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Faced with deadlocked jurors, a judge on Tuesday declared a mistrial in the case of three former sheriff’s deputies accused of murdering a Black man whom they had repeatedly shocked with stun guns during a 2017 arrest. Senior Judge H. Gibbs Flanders Jr. granted the defense motions for mistrials on the charges against Henry Lee Copeland, Michael Howell and Rhett Scott in the death of Eurie Martin, 58. The jury foreman told the judge that no jurors in the Sandersville courtroom had changed their minds since Friday, the first day of deliberations, and that more time was unlikely to lead to the unanimity needed for convictions or acquittals. Martin had a history of schizophrenia and was walking through the central Georgia town of Deepstep on a scorching day in July 2017, taking a 30-mile journey to see his relatives for his birthday. A resident called 911 to report Martin as suspicious after he approached the person and asked for a drink of water. Responding officers said Martin refused to stop walking, threw down a soda can and took an aggressive stance, prompting them to fire their stun guns when he didn’t follow instructions. Beyond murder, the fired deputies faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, simple assault and reckless conduct.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Some Native Hawaiians are objecting to President Joe Biden’s choice for U.S. attorney in the 50th state, saying Clare Connors treated dozens of elders like criminals when her office prosecuted them for blocking a road while protesting the construction of a mountaintop telescope. “She has acted aggressively towards the Hawaiian people during all of our stand for Mauna Kea,” said Kealoha Pisciotta, one of the protest leaders. Pisciotta and other Native Hawaiians who oppose the telescope believe the summit of Mauna Kea is sacred. They say building the Thirty Meter Telescope on the state’s tallest mountain would further desecrate a place already defiled by a dozen other observatories. The 38 Native Hawaiian elders prosecuted for obstruction were in their 60s through 80s, and many of them are community leaders. Pisciotta said she’s concerned about Connors being named U.S. attorney because Native Hawaiians have been deprived of their land and their right to self-determination since the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. “I think of her as a danger to many situations in Hawaii because she doesn’t have to seem to have the compassion or the aloha that is needed considering our political situation,” Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal court has rejected a request by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee, which argues its rights were violated while campaigning at a school on Election Day. The court last week denied the committee’s request to grant a permanent injunction that would have forced the Coeur d’Alene School District to allow groups to hand out election materials on school grounds even if they interfered with kids getting to school. The court didn’t rule on the merits of the case, which continues. But the court found that the group was unlikely to win the case because, among other things, it misinterpreted Idaho’s campaign-free-zone election law. Specifically, the committee argues that it can hand out election materials anywhere on school grounds as long as the group is more than 100 feet from the building where voting is taking place. While campaigning is allowed at schools, the district contends it can prevent electioneering within 100 feet of campus grounds if groups are interfering with kids going to class. “While Plaintiffs seemingly believe that Idaho (law) is meant to protect their right to electioneer 101 feet or more from the polling place, the language of the statute instead illustrates that it is meant to protect voters from interference,” Chief U.S. District Court Judge David C. Nye wrote.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate voted Tuesday to repeal a law requiring that parents or guardians be notified when girls younger than 18 are seeking an abortion. Building on momentum among abortion rights activists after September’s Texas “heartbeat” law banned most of the procedures there, Democrats who control the General Assembly in Illinois want to dump the 1995 law requiring notification, which both sides of the debate call the last restriction on abortions in the state. But with a 32-22 tally in favor of repeal, the count fell short of approval of all who make up the Democrats’ 41-18 advantage, showing the reticence among moderate Democrats on a law whose proposed repeal now moves to the House with two days left in the General Assembly’s fall session. Republicans have repeatedly pointed out that notification has the support of nearly three-quarters of Illinoisans responding to a poll conducted last spring. And they publicized the nearly 50,000 notices of opposition filed electronically before the vote. Opponents say the notification law, adopted by GOP majorities in 1995 but not in effect until 2013 amid legal challenges, is a means of denying abortion rights to teenagers by delaying the procedure. They say it’s a hindrance to those who live in abusive environments and are intimidated by an alternative process – pleading their case to a judge.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An external review of state police agencies found they need to bolster the recruitment and promotion of minority and female officers and increase training about racial bias. The findings are part of a 100-page report released Monday that was commissioned by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb following demonstrations across the country and state last year protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The consulting firm Hillard Heintze acknowledged attempts by Indiana State Police to recruit more diverse officer candidates, while citing that white men made up more than 80% of promotions and reassignments in 2018-20. One agency strategy of sending white officers to barbershops and restaurants in predominately Black communities to talk about the job was viewed as “offensive or patronizing” by some Black ISP officers, according to the report. “The ISP provides its members with cultural awareness education and training taught by command-level personnel, demonstrating its importance to the organization. However, this training does not include a discussion of implicit bias or actions officers could take to reduce the influence of implicit bias when interacting with their colleagues and community members,” the study said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted at a University of Iowa fraternity is suing two men and the fraternity. The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges two members of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also known as Iowa FIJI, assaulted her at a party at the fraternity in September 2020. She also alleges the assault was filmed and photographed, with the images widely circulated. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from the two men and the fraternity. It also names Mu Deuteron, the corporate entity under which FIJI’s chapter at the school operates, and the Phi Gamma Delta Educational Foundation, a nonprofit based in Kentucky. The two men were expelled from the fraternity. The lack of charges prompted several protests on the University of Iowa campus, including on Aug. 31, when about 1,000 people gathered outside the fraternity house and a second location calling for action on the case and to abolish the fraternity. An online petition making similar demands had more than 167,000 signatures as of Tuesday.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: A sheriff’s deputy caught on dashcam video running over a Black man who was fleeing shirtless across a field is now working at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility while under criminal investigation, according to the attorney for the injured man. Lionel Womack, a former police detective from Kansas City, Kansas, alleges in an excessive-force lawsuit filed last year that Kiowa County Sheriff’s Deputy Jeremy Rodriguez intentionally drove over him during the Aug. 15, 2020, incident that was captured on dashcam video. Womack says he sustained serious injuries to his back, pelvis, and right thigh, knee and foot. In a court filing responding to the lawsuit, Rodriguez denied he intentionally swerved his truck to run over Womack. The deputy said he learned later that Womack did not possess a weapon. Rodriguez is currently under criminal investigation by federal and state authorities over the incident. Attorney Michael Kuckelman, who represents Womack, wrote in a letter Tuesday to Kansas Secretary of Corrections Jefferey Zmuda and Warden Dan Schnurr that he was “shocked” to learn in a deposition that they would employ Rodriguez, who works as a master sergeant at the facility.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library book gifting program is expanding throughout Kentucky, the state’s Department of Education announced Tuesday. With the goal of inspiring a love of reading, the voluntary program gives books each month to children from infancy to 5 years old, free of charge to families, through funding shared by Parton, Kentucky’s state government and community partners. “I’m so excited and want to thank everyone partnering with us to make more dreams come true for children and families in Kentucky,” said Parton, a country music icon, actress and philanthropist from neighboring Tennessee. State funding will help increase registration in existing Kentucky Imagination Library programs and find community partners to start new ones, the state said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will receive $595 million in federal disaster block grant aid to help with housing restoration and other recovery needs from last year’s back-to-back blows of hurricanes Laura and Delta, Louisiana’s U.S. senators announced Tuesday. While welcomed by officials as critical to rebuilding efforts in southwest Louisiana, the money falls far short of the multibillion-dollar estimates of need, offering only about 20% of the $3 billion in assistance requested by Gov. John Bel Edwards. It also comes 14 months after Laura wrecked the Lake Charles region – a delay that had locals questioning whether the nation had forgotten them. “It has been over a year since Louisiana was hammered by Hurricane Laura and this relief has taken far too long,” Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy said in a statement. “This funding is a welcome first step, but there is more work to be done to return southwest Louisiana to wholeness.” GOP U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said the money will provide “a helping hand as we rebuild” but said residents “are still reeling.” Edwards said Louisiana already is drafting its spending proposal for submission once the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issues its regulations. But the Democratic governor also suggested the state will be requesting more federal assistance.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor has announced a series of programs including tuition forgiveness to help the state navigate a need for more health care workers. One of the programs will provide $4 million in tuition support via scholarships and student loan relief to help students pursuing careers in nursing and other health professions, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Monday. The state will also use $8.5 million for tuition forgiveness to provide money to health care employers and workers to help the workers gain new skills and earn advanced credentials, she said. Another program will use $1.5 million to create a public service campaign to promote health care professions and try to recruit people into the fields, Mills said. The Democratic governor said the state will implement the moves by the end of the year. Maine has lost jobs during the pandemic, and more than 10% of that loss has come in the health care workforce. Health care facilities across the state “have had to grapple with a shortage of workers, and the pandemic has only made the problem worse,” Mills said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A congressman announced Wednesday that he has deactivated his official congressional and campaign Facebook and Instagram accounts until their parent company and Congress make substantial reforms to protect children, health and democratic values. Democratic U.S. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger said his decision follows disturbing whistleblower reports about the company’s own research revealing harm to democracy, the mental health of teens and the amplification of hate speech. In a news release, Ruppersberger cited a report in The Washington Post that Facebook’s algorithm at one time treated “angry” reactions as five times more valuable than “likes,” disproportionately promoting content that was likely to include “misinformation, toxicity and low-quality news.” “Facebook’s basic business model sows division and disinformation and I can no longer use it – and promote it from my official mediums – in good conscience for the time being,” Ruppersberger said. “While Facebook must do better to police themselves, Congress must also act and pass reasonable social media reforms.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously disputed portrayals of the company as one that puts profit over the well-being of its users or pushes divisive content. Ruppersberger said his Twitter account will remain active. He also emphasized that he and his staff are available to take constituents’ calls, emails – even faxes.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Officials are weighing creating a commission to account for the city’s role in slavery and potentially provide reparations to Black residents. The City Council’s Committee on Civil Rights held a hearing Tuesday to hear from Black community activists, academics and the public on how the city can approach the issue. Dr. Jemadari Kamara, a professor of Africana Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was among a number of people who spoke in favor of forming a commission on reparations, noting that San Francisco and other major cities have already taken similar steps. Kevin Peterson, founder of the New Democracy Coalition that’s been pushing for years for the city to recognize its role in the slave trade, was among those who stressed that the Black community needs to drive the reparations process. “Any committee must be Black-led and Black-controlled,” he said. “Let Black people lead on the issue.” Many of those testifying said racist policies that persisted in Boston long after slavery ended have led to wide disparities in family incomes, homeownership and other measures between Black and white residents. The city was rocked by violent, racial protests in the 1970s and 1980s as public schools were forcibly desegregated through court order.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would eliminate the so-called tampon tax on menstrual products, sending the bill to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is expected to sign it into law. Michigan would join over 20 other states that have either ended the sales tax on menstrual products or never had one, according to Period Equity, a legal organization that advocates for making menstrual products tax-exempt. Though several bills to end the tampon tax were introduced in the Legislature in the past five years, none of those bills made it to a floor vote. Both chambers in the Republican-controlled Legislature have voted in the past month to approve lifting the tax. The Democratic governor has backed efforts to abolish the tax in Michigan. One of the sponsors of the bills passed Tuesday, Sen. Winnie Brinks, said it’s been a long road to get the elimination of the tampon tax this far, but she is thankful for everyone who has supported the effort in the past. “This is a commonsense move that will reduce an unfair tax burden that is placed on only half of Michigan’s population for a significant portion of our lives,” the Grand Rapids Democrat said. “These bills will move Michigan toward a fairer tax structure, which is a goal I think we all share regardless of which side of the aisle we sit on.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The case of a man who waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died is among several examples that have frustrated officials in rural hospitals whose facilities are overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Bob Cameron, 87, spent two days in his hometown hospital in Hallock, Minnesota, where caregivers searched nonstop for space in a larger hospital that could find and fix the source of his severe gastrointestinal bleeding and treat his COVID-19. The bleeding exhausted the hospital’s blood supply, so state troopers shuttled new units 130 miles from Fargo, North Dakota, to Hallock to keep Cameron alive. A bed was secured Oct. 12 at Sanford Health in Fargo, but his condition worsened after surgery there to find the source of his bleeding. He died Oct. 13, the Star Tribune reports. “We can’t say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner that he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,” said Cameron’s granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals were caring for more COVID-19 patients than Twin Cities hospitals. “We’re playing tag back and forth between Aitkin, Crosby, Brainerd and Princeton,” said Dr. Arden Virnig, supervisor of a five-bed ER at Mille Lacs Health System in Onamia, Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nMadison: A racially diverse school in central Mississippi is honoring its namesake – a woman who was a leader in ensuring Black children received education when the state was deeply segregated. Descendants of Rosa Scott were on campus Monday at Rosa Scott High School, a campus for about 400 ninth graders in the Madison County School District. “Because of her, many African American children began to be educated,” Scott’s great-granddaughter, Maryann Gaylor Kennedy, told WLBT-TV. Scott was born in 1874, was educated at Fisk University, and worked as a teacher and principal in Madison County. She led an effort to raise money for a school that opened in Madison in the 1920s. Scott died in 1938, and her gravesite is part of the courtyard on the current campus. When a new school was built in 1959, it was named for Scott. During the ceremony Monday, principals, educators and alumni talked about the school’s impact and Scott’s mission of advancement. Her family gave the school a copy of Scott’s biography written by one of her granddaughters, Rose Mary Collum Gaylor. Students designed a flag for the school, giving replicas to the family. “Rosa Scott was a powerhouse,” another of her granddaughters, Margaret Bernstein, told WJTV-TV. “She really understood that education is the key to success, and she wanted to unlock that for Black children, so that’s why it was important to be here today.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A man alleges in a lawsuit that police officers punched, kicked and stomped on him before illegally searching the apartment he shared with his girlfriend after claiming he had committed a minor traffic violation. The lawsuit was filed in federal court Monday on behalf of Tranell Stewart, 38, and his former girlfriend, Lisa Jones, against five Maryland Heights police officers and the city of Maryland Heights, a St. Louis suburb. It accuses the officers of unlawful seizure, excessive force and unlawful search. It also accuses the city of liability, charging that Maryland Heights has not addressed years of police stopping and searching Black motorists at rates far above their representation in the city. The city, the police department and the police union did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Stewart pulled into the parking lot of his apartment complex Oct. 26, 2016. Officer David Devouton pulled behind his car and told him he had failed to use his turn signal, which Stewart denied, according to the lawsuit. When Stewart tried to get out of his car to get to his infant son from the back seat, Devouton grabbed Stewart’s hair and tried to pull him to the ground, saying, “You’re going to die today,” the lawsuit says. Stewart said he suffered a fractured nose, a black eye, and emotional pain and fear.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A preliminary report on an Amtrak train derailment last month that killed three people and injured dozens more offered no clues about what triggered the accident but said that the train’s emergency brakes were activated and that Amtrak estimated the damage at more than $22 million. However, one attorney whose client is suing Amtrak and BNSF Railway said he wanted to learn more about the crashworthiness of the train’s observation car, and an attorney for a crew member said she reported seeing a 30-foot dip along the railroad, where it appeared the track bed had given way. The National Transportation Safety Board issued its preliminary report Tuesday on the Sept. 25 derailment of the westbound Empire Builder just west of Joplin, in north-central Montana. It was mostly factual, saying that there were 154 people on board and that 44 passengers and crew were taken to area hospitals with injuries. Passengers without serious injuries were bused to the nearby town of Chester, where residents provided food and other aid. The train was traveling at between 75 and 78 miles per hour, just below the speed limit of 79 mph on that section of track, when its emergency brakes were activated. The two locomotives and two railcars remained on the rails, and eight cars derailed.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts has split with former President Donald Trump over which Republican candidate should become his successor as governor. Trump on Monday endorsed Falls City businessman Charles Herbster, a close political ally. Shortly after the announcement, Ricketts released a statement arguing that Herbster isn’t qualified to serve in the role. “While I agree with President Trump on many things, I strongly disagree that Charles Herbster is qualified to be our next governor,” said Ricketts, who can’t seek reelection in 2022 due to term limits. In a statement, Trump praised Herbster as “an extraordinarily successful businessman who will fight for our farmers and ranchers, support our military and vets, and protect and defend your under siege Second Amendment rights.” Ricketts hasn’t formally endorsed a candidate in the GOP governor’s primary race, but he has made several public appearances with University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, and several of his close political allies work on Pillen’s campaign. Several other other Republicans have launched campaigns, including state Sen. Brett Lindstrom, of Omaha, and Breland Ridenour, an information technology manager. Former Gov. Dave Heineman has said he may run as well, as has Herbster’s former running mate, former state Sen. Theresa Thibodeau.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A private-public partnership has expanded a local program providing mobile shower trailers for homeless people through the Clean the World nonprofit, officials said. Clark County, Caesars Entertainment and the Caesars Foundation announced a three-year commitment Monday to split what Clean the World founder and CEO Shawn Seipler said is about a $250,000-a-year cost. Trailers offer four individual shower stalls with a toilet and sink, and users are provided hygiene kits including soap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste. One stall is compliant with disability accessibility requirements. Visits usually last 20 to 30 minutes. Clean the World trailers have made the rounds in southern Nevada since 2017, providing some 28,000 showers and 30,000 hygiene kits, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Trailers typically park for about four hours at nonprofit service centers in and around the city. Seipler said shower users might also seek help with job placement, drug rehabilitation, mental health care or legal issues. “As folks come to us to shower on a regular basis, they start to build relationships with those that are there,” he said. Partner agencies sometimes also offer health screenings, vaccinations for hepatitis and COVID-19, along with other services.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A drive-in theater and a bandstand are among the historic properties on this year’s “Seven to Save” list from the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance. The list, announced Tuesday, highlights vulnerable historic resources and related threats to community life and economic well-being. The Weirs Drive-In Theater and surrounding land are on the list. It’s the largest of three remaining drive-in theaters in the state and is currently for sale. The theater stands on land that was heavily used by Indigenous people for fishing-related activities as much as 10,000 years ago. Also on the list is the Milford Bandstand, which was built on the town’s Oval in 1896 for the Milford Cornet Band’s summer concerts. “This significant Victorian bandstand now requires extensive renovation to continue to serve future generations as a focal point for community gatherings and activities,” the alliance said in a news release. Two Cornish Colony properties in transition share a spot on the list: the Blow-Me-Down Farm and the Percy MacKaye Home. Opera North is renovating part of the farm, and descendants of MacKaye are seeking new preservation/stewardship solutions for his home and studio. Also listed are the United Baptist Church in Laconia, built in 1892; the Wilder-Holton House in Lancaster, built in 1780; and the Newington Railroad Depot, built in 1873. The alliance also is featuring a thematic listing of the state’s historic theaters, many of which were already struggling when the pandemic struck.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: Governments, academics and scientists are proposing an ambitious effort to improve the health of Barnegat Bay, a fragile waterway that “has been loved to death.” The Barnegat Bay Partnership, a constellation of groups dedicated to helping the bay, on Tuesday unveiled a detailed and far-reaching plan to improve water quality, increase the number of days that bay beaches are open for swimming, increase the amount of shellfish, and address an explosion of jellyfish in the bay that are making parts of it difficult to use. Officials from federal, state and local governments signed the pledge, but it remains to be seen what, if any, specific actions will be taken in furtherance of those goals. “The Barnegat Bay in its current state is a jewel of the Jersey Shore, but it has some serious problems,” said Stan Hales, director of the partnership. “The bay has been loved to death.” Environmentalists and government officials have long recognized threats to Barnegat Bay, including rampant development along its shorelines and interior watershed areas, as well as the resulting flow of pesticides and nitrogen from lawn fertilizer and agricultural uses that makes its way into the bay. That helps contribute to decreased oxygen levels, which harms fish, shellfish and plant life and can turbocharge jellyfish populations, which thrive in degraded water.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It’s been years in the making, and now officials say the first leg of a major renewable energy transmission line has been energized. The New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority made the announcement Tuesday, saying the Western Spirit project is expected to be in operation by the end of the year. The transmission line will carry wind-generated power to the grid in New Mexico and other Western markets. The project involved a novel public-private partnership between the transmission authority and Pattern Energy, which is developing a collection of wind farms in the state. New Mexico’s largest electric utility, Public Service Co. of New Mexico, will acquire and operate the transmission line when it’s complete. State officials said the transmission line will be important as New Mexico aims to eliminate carbon emissions within the utility sector over the next two decades. RETA Board Chairman Robert Busch said in a statement that the successful development of the transmission line and the state’s energy policies are spurring interest from renewable energy and transmission developers. He said the line enables new investment of more than $1.5 billion in renewable generation and transmission in the state.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayoral candidates lobbed accusations at each other about palling around with gangsters and acting like children or clowns, but their second debate ended on a surprisingly tender note involving cats and veganism. A week before the city of 8.8 million people votes to pick a new mayor, Democrat Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa laid out their plans Tuesday for addressing rising violent crime and how to chart a path out of the pandemic’s deadly wake. It was the second meeting between Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president and former New York City police captain who is widely expected to win the election in the heavily Democratic city, and Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol who’s known for his signature red beret, streetwise proclamations and penchant for stunts. On the pandemic, Adams supports a mandate from outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio that city workers such as police officers and firefighters get vaccinated against COVID-19 or be placed on unpaid leave. But Adams said he would have had more discussions with the workers’ unions before announcing the policy. The rivals were asked to pay each other compliments as they wrapped up the debate. Adams complimented Sliwa for adopting and rescuing cats, 16 of which he and his wife keep in their small Manhattan apartment. Sliwa praised Adams for promoting his vegan lifestyle, saying it “has already probably helped dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of people.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Dozens of residents have weighed in to say Republicans should shelve proposed congressional district maps that would likely give the GOP the most seats for the foreseeable future while needlessly fracturing the state’s largest counties. Republicans and Democrats have spent the past few weeks creating separate redistricting maps. During the first of two days of public hearings on them, speakers criticized GOP proposals that could make at least 10 of the state’s 14 U.S. House districts favorable to Republican candidates. Republicans currently hold an 8-5 advantage in the state’s congressional ranks, but North Carolina will get another member through at least 2032 because of population gains recorded by the 2020 census. Maps most favorable to Republicans would split predominantly Democratic Mecklenburg and Wake counties among at least three districts, some of which would spill into more conservative and rural surrounding counties, thereby making it harder for Democrats to win. “This is not fair, since North Carolina is a half-and-half state with the two parties,” Kathy Wheeler of Guilford County told redistricting committee members at the Legislative Building. “The maps proposed by Republican members dilute Democratic votes and deprive communities of effective representation.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Enrollment declines at the state’s institutions of higher learning since the COVID-19 pandemic began haven’t been as steep as elsewhere, and some have bucked the trend entirely. According to a new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, enrollment across the country at colleges and universities is down 6.5% compared to two years ago – the largest two-year enrollment drop in the past 50 years. North Dakota’s numbers haven’t been nearly so steep, and in the case of some universities, including Dickinson State University, enrollment has increased, KFYR-TV reports. “Students that are interested or deciding to go college, that number is kind of going down. But we, in this specific area of the country, don’t have that quite as much as other areas. So we still have a pretty good pool of students that are graduating and going to college,” said Stephanie Osborne, DSU’s admissions director. Overall, North Dakota colleges and universities experienced a 3.4% decrease in enrollment from 2019 and a 1.4% decrease from 2020. Other schools that have actually seen enrollment increases since 2019 include Dakota College at Bottineau, Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is adjusting its quarantine recommendations for schools in hopes of keeping students and educators in class more even if they’re exposed to someone with the coronavirus in a school setting or activity. The guidance is optional for schools and applies only when direct exposure happens in a school environment, not outside school. Under the “mask to stay” part of the approach, even exposed students who were unmasked and unvaccinated could remain in class rather than quarantining at home as long as they wear a mask for 14 days after their last exposure, monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and get tested if they have symptoms. If they don’t develop symptoms and test negative for the virus between the fifth and seventh days, they could stop those extra precautions. The other part of the guidance, dubbed “test to play,” allows asymptomatic contacts to keep participating in extracurricular activities if they wear a mask when able and get tested both when they’re notified they’ve been exposed to the virus and again between the fifth and seventh day. A negative result on that second test would allow them to resume normal activity after the seventh day. The guidance also encourages districts to consider same-day testing for athletic competitions with potential for school-to-school exposure.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge ruled Monday that the state can move forward with scheduled lethal injections for five death row inmates, including Julius Jones, whose case has drawn international attention and who is scheduled to die Nov. 28. Judge Stephen Friot denied a motion for a preliminary injunction sought by the five inmates, paving the way for the state to proceed with seven lethal injections scheduled over the next six months. The state is scheduled to conduct its first execution in more than six years Thursday, when John Marion Grant, 60, is set to receive a lethal injection for the 1998 killing of a prison cafeteria worker. Grant, Jones and three other death row inmates were removed from a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s three-drug lethal injection protocol because none of the five offered an alternative method of execution. A trial on that challenge is scheduled before Friot in February. “The case is complete in this court as to these five plaintiffs,” Friot said. Twenty-six of the 32 Oklahoma death row inmates who were on the original challenge provided the court with an alternative method of execution, including the use of different drug combinations or firing squad. Attorneys for the five inmates vowed to immediately appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s school board ended an in-person meeting amid controversy over a proposed COVID-19 vaccine mandate for children 12 and older after unmasked protesters showed up and refused to don face coverings. The board that oversees the state’s largest school district resumed its meeting with online streaming Tuesday after protesters refused to comply with requests from security guards to put on masks, according to a statement from Portland Public Schools. Some of the protesters were not from Portland but traveled from elsewhere in Oregon and Washington state, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Conversely, earlier in the day, about 500 students walked out of class in support of the proposed vaccine mandate. Rules to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, such as a statewide school mask mandate for all children, have generated protests in other districts and school boards, and superintendents are often the focus of such actions. In Redmond, critics of state mandates have crowded board meetings and dominated public comment periods. In Adrian, school board members voted to fire Superintendent Kevin Purnell when he refused to buck state policy, the newspaper reports. The Portland school board is set to vote on the vaccine mandate for students older than 12 on Nov. 2.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Prosecutors have dropped a felony theft charge against a man who underpaid for a bottle of Mountain Dew by 43 cents. Perry County prosecutors dropped the theft charge this month against Joseph Sobolewski, 38, and downgraded another charge, the Patriot-News reports. In August, Sobolewski went into an Exxon in Duncannon and saw a sign advertising two 20-ounce Mountain Dew bottles for $3, he said. He took one bottle, slapped $2 on the counter for what he thought was a $1.50 soda and walked out, not realizing the discount did not apply to a single bottle. The bottle really cost $2.29, so including tax, he owed the store 43 cents. State police found Sobolewski and arrested him on a felony charge. A judge ordered him held on $50,000 cash-only bond. He was in jail for seven days before his public defender successfully argued for his release, the newspaper reports. Sobolewski had twice in the past 10 years been charged with theft, once for not paying for a tank of gas and another time for stealing a pair of shoes from a store. Under Pennsylvania’s three-strikes law, a third theft charge must be a felony, regardless of the amount or value involved. He faced up to seven years in prison.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The land where the Rhode Island Narragansett tribe survived near-annihilation in a battle with English colonists in 1675 has been transferred to the tribe. The transfer of the land from the Rhode Island Historical Society was finalized Friday. Tribal members gathered Saturday in the woods in South Kingstown at a monument commemorating what they believe to be the site of the Great Swamp Massacre, The Public’s Radio reports. They lit three fires representing the past, present and future and recognized the return of 5 acres of land they consider sacred. The tribe’s leaders in 1636 granted land to Roger Williams, an exile of the Puritan Massachusetts Bay colony who founded what became the city of Providence. Good relations with English colonists ended in the 1670s when the tribe was nearly destroyed in King Philip’s War. The battle was fought Dec. 19, 1675. Hundreds of tribal members were killed. In 1906, the family that owned the land gave it to the historical society to preserve it. The society has been working on the transfer for four years so the tribe itself could protect the land. It required court approval because the land was held in a trust. The Narragansetts are thankful, the tribe’s medicine man and historic preservation officer, John Brown III, told The Boston Globe. “For many years, the Narragansetts were visitors to a place that was theirs,” he said. “Now that this has happened, we know we can go back to a place of our forefathers, where there was happiness and sorrow, and we can go there as rightful owners.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The acting head of the state’s Office of Juvenile Justice says she faces a staffing crisis, with few applicants for hundreds of vacancies. Juvenile Justice corrections officers get $35,000 a year to start, but the shifts are grueling, and violence is an ever-present danger. Eden Hendrick, who was appointed after Freddie Pough resigned under fire a month ago, told legislators last week that she has more vacancies than working correction officers, The Post and Courier reports. “The applicant pool is the main problem,” she said. “There’s just no one that is applying right now,” The State newspaper reports. Hendrick told a state Senate corrections subcommittee that every recruiter in the office has left, so she plans to hire a recruiting company to find people interested in the 232 corrections officer vacancies. For now, she’s hired a part-time expert who used to recruit for the state Department of Corrections, The State reports. Hendrick also said she is stopping two programs started by Pough, who moved administrators to a building outside the main juvenile jail complex in Columbia and pushed to house juveniles with long sentences in regional facilities rather than the Broad River Road Complex. Regionalization is on indefinite hold because there isn’t enough staff or money, she said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBelle Fourche: Plans are in the works to build one of the largest ramen-producing facilities in the country in a small Black Hills community. CEO Bill Saller of California-based Albany Farms said the complex in Belle Fourche will include a flour mill, production factories and packaging areas that would produce more than 100 million packages of ramen each year and eventually employ up to 900 people. Belle Fourche Rail Park and the state’s agricultural economy are part of the plan, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Wheat will be brought to the factory, while ramen cups and packets will be shipped by train, Saller said. Albany Farms recently bought a building in Belle Fourche for its factory and is working on purchasing 11 of the surrounding acres, according to company spokeswoman Stephanie Magoon. The company manufactures its products overseas but decided it needed to switch gears once the pandemic hit. “With the onset of COVID, importing food became problematic. Transportation has become a major issue for food companies and certainly for us,” Saller said. Saller said the price for the company’s shipping containers has increased an average of $18,000 per container, doubling import costs. So the company decided to move all manufacturing to the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two bills introduced by lawmakers would forbid state licensing officials from disciplining doctors for how they treat COVID-19 or what they say about vaccines, potentially undermining a new effort to crack down on doctors who spread misinformation in the midst of the pandemic. State Reps. Debra Moody, R-Covington, and Chris Todd, R-Madison County, introduced bills Tuesday that each bar the Board of Medical Examiners and Board of Osteopathic Examination, which license and discipline physicians throughout the state, from taking any punitive action against a physician for the recommendations they make about COVID-19 treatment, mitigation or prevention. Moody’s bill protects any recommendation made “so long as the physician exercised independent medical judgment and believes the medical treatment is in the best interest of the patient.” Todd’s bill outlaws disciplining a physician “relating solely (to their) prescription, recommendation, use, or opinion relative to a treatment for COVID-19.” Dr. Stephen Loyd, a member of the Board of Medical Examiners who reviewed Todd’s bill, said he did not believe the legislation as written would have a great impact but conceded it might open the door for a doctor to argue that false claims were opinions protected under the law.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Voting rights advocates are suing the state again, this time with support from a former U.S. attorney general, over newly redrawn congressional district maps that favor the GOP, claiming the maps dilute the vote of communities of color after growth in America’s largest red state came overwhelmingly from Hispanic, Black and Asian American people. The lawsuit was filed Monday by Texas voters and Voto Latino, a voter advocacy organization, in an Austin federal court just moments after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the redrawn districts into law. Texas was the only state to be allocated two new congressional seats earlier this year after U.S. census figures showed the state’s population grew by 4 million people, nearly half of whom were Hispanic. The latest lawsuit alleges the new U.S. House maps violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act by not giving people of color a fair opportunity to elect their representatives. The maps do not include any additional districts in which Black or Hispanic voters make up more than 50% of eligible voters. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Jr., who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and whose affiliate organization, the National Redistricting Action Fund, is supporting the lawsuit, said the maps, which pave potentially safer paths for Texas’ majority GOP incumbents to remain in office, were a “desperate grasp for partisan political power.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop abruptly quit the state’s independent redistricting commission after criticizing it for favoring urban areas. Bishop, a Republican, said Monday that the commission’s congressional map proposals favored Democrats. The commission will present its map proposals to the Legislature’s redistricting committee Nov. 1. “This is a metro-centric group,” Bishop said during the meeting. “When five of the seven are from the Wasatch Front … the majority are from Salt Lake County, we see things in a different way.” House Speaker Brad Wilson, who appointed Bishop to the panel, said he shared Bishop’s frustrations with the commission and does not plan to appoint a replacement. “His decision to step down at this point in the process is further evidence that the duly elected representatives of the people are best suited to redraw district boundaries, as the courts have repeatedly affirmed,” Wilson said in a statement. Better Boundaries, the group behind the 2018 ballot initiative that created the independent commission, said it was disappointed by Bishop’s resignation. “Moving forward, we are encouraged by the work of the remaining six commissioners to suggest objective and qualified maps to the state legislative redistricting committee through this fair and transparent process,” Executive Director Katie Wright said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that he wouldn’t reimpose a state of emergency that would authorize him to put a statewide mask mandate back in place as the delta variant has driven an increase in coronavirus cases. Speaking at a weekly briefing about Vermont’s response to the pandemic, Scott said he doesn’t want to overuse the emergency power he has as governor. “There’s a time and a place for a state of emergency, and I can assure you this isn’t it,” he said. “And I believe that we’ll get through this with all the measures, all the mitigation measures we put into place and doing all the right things and taking some self-responsibility.” Scott said he’s also more optimistic about the future of the pandemic than he has been in weeks: Booster shots have been approved for most people over 18 who have already been vaccinated, the federal government is expected to authorize in the coming weeks vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, and COVID-19 case numbers are starting to decrease across the country and in Vermont. Still, a group of lawmakers, school nurses, and other medical professionals on Monday urged Scott to reinstate the state of emergency and indoor mask mandate, saying school staff, parents, hospitals and health care workers are stressed coping with the pandemic, some to the breaking point.\n\nVirginia\n\nPortsmouth: Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy will partner with Dominion Energy on a $200 million factory making turbine blades for offshore wind projects, creating 310 jobs, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday. Virginia-based Dominion previously selected the Spanish company as its partner for its $7.8 billion energy generation project 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. The Siemens Gamesa factory at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal will produce turbine blades for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project as well as other offshore wind energy generators around North America. The factory project includes more than $80 million in investments for buildings and equipment at the terminal, where about 50 new service jobs are expected to support the effort. Over the next 10 years, building and operating the offshore wind industry will be worth $109 billion to businesses in its supply chain, according to a recent report from the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind. That figure is up from the group’s $70 billion estimate just two years ago. “Virginians want renewable energy, our employers want it, and Virginia is delivering it,” Northam said in a statement. “Make no mistake: Virginia is building a new industry in renewable energy, with more new jobs to follow, and that’s good news for our country.”\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: An investigation headed by a former U.S. attorney has found a sheriff violated policies against bias-free policing and other standards during a controversial January encounter with a Black newspaper carrier. The 48-page report by Brian Moran, released Tuesday, faulted Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer’s late-night decision to follow a car driven by then-24-year old Sedrick Altheimer and subsequently call in a large emergency response with claims that Altheimer threatened to kill him. “We are unable to substantiate Sheriff Troyer’s claim that Mr. Altheimer threatened to kill or harm him during that incident,” a summary of Moran’s report said. “We also find that a reasonable person could conclude that Sheriff Troyer exhibited an improper bias in his confrontation with Mr. Altheimer.” The Seattle Times reports the findings, commissioned by the Pierce County Council, found Troyer, who is white, violated professional conduct policies against bias-free policing and engaging in law enforcement activities while off duty, among others. It concluded Troyer may not have known Altheimer’s race when he first began following him in the early morning hours of Jan. 27, but he did know when he called a 911 emergency dispatcher.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Halloween is still days away, but the West Virginia Division of Highways is thinking ahead to keep drivers safe in snow and ice this winter. Drivers in the division’s District 1 just finished “dry runs” for winter snowplow routes. “We want to make sure that our trucks are well-maintained, greased and that all the equipment is working properly,” said District 1 Maintenance Engineer Kathy Rushworth. Running snowplow routes early allows drivers to familiarize themselves with their routes and get used to driving the plows. District 1 has 215 drivers assigned to drive plows in the snow and ice. They’re the same men and women responsible for cutting grass, trimming trees, cutting ditches and doing other maintenance work during spring, summer and fall. The district has plows dedicated to Boone, Clay, Kanawha, Mason and Putnam counties. Other snowplows are responsible for clearing snow and ice on U.S. 35 and interstates 64, 77 and 79.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Assembly gave final approval Wednesday to a package of anti-abortion bills, many of which Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed two years ago and is all but certain to reject again. Republicans do not have enough votes in the Legislature to override a veto. Republicans said they were trying again because the measures are a priority, and there’s a chance Evers will change his mind. Democrats, who all voted against the bills, accused Republicans of only taking up the bills to energize conservatives ahead of the 2022 midterm election. One bill, which Evers vetoed in 2019, would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt. Violators would be guilty of a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. The bill also would make intentionally causing the death of a child born alive as a result of an abortion a felony punishable by life in prison. Doctors insist the bill is a solution in search of a problem. They and other opponents say babies are almost never born alive during failed abortion attempts, and in the rare instances in which they are, doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep them alive.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Requiring workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 would result in up to $10 million in fines and at least $500,000 in damages under bills state lawmakers will consider in a rare special session that began Tuesday. In all, they plan to look at 20 proposals – including a few having nothing to do with President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccination for certain workers – over the next several days after legislators debated whether to adjourn without considering anything at all. The House and Senate voted to move ahead despite rejecting timesaving rules to limit testimony and debate and prohibit bills unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination in an effort to wrap up the session in just three days. “In five days we are going to have hundreds of people, potentially thousands, who are going to lose their jobs because of a mandate,” said Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper, the lead sponsor of a bill that would allow people denied work because they’re not vaccinated to collect at least $500,000 in civil damages. A bill sponsored by Rep. Bill Fortner, R-Gillette, would fine any public servant who tries to enforce any COVID-19 vaccine mandate up to $10 million. Schools would be barred from enforcing student mask-wearing and vaccination against any disease under a bill sponsored by Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie. Wyoming has been one the most vaccine-resistant states, behind only West Virginia, and as a result has one of the highest case rates in the U.S. over recent months.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/09/smokey-bear-tarantula-trek-censoring-adam-eve-news-around-states/39932141/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Some residents of a rural community are complaining about a Spanish-language event planned for this weekend featuring live music and bull riding, but a local official says he worries such comments appear “anti-Latino.” News outlets report people from the Snowdoun area near Montgomery have asked county and city leaders to block the Festival Latino, scheduled Sunday in a field. They say a similar event in July was so loud and raucous it traumatized livestock. But Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange says organizers haven’t violated any zoning rules. County Commissioner Dan Harris says he voted against a move to block the festival because opposition appears to be “anti-Latino” even if it isn’t. Harris says he doesn’t want to be part of that, particularly after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A wildlife monitoring group is seeking citizen scientists to help track beluga whales off the state’s coast. The Peninsula Clarion reports the Alaska Beluga Monitoring Partnership is offering volunteers an opportunity to help scientists understand more about Cook Inlet beluga whales. The partnership is a collaboration of several organizations including Beluga Whale Alliance, Defenders of Wildlife and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Monitoring events are expected to take place between Aug. 14 and Nov. 15. Planned monitoring locations include Twentymile River and Bird Point near Girdwood, Ship Creek in Anchorage, and the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers. Officials say volunteers will learn about the conservation needs of Cook Inlet beluga whales and receive training on identifying and recording data on beluga distribution and behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials have approved placing a “sanctuary city” measure on the ballot, but not without some pushback. KVOA-TV reports the Tucson City Council voted Tuesday night to allow the initiative on the November ballot, which could potentially lead to Arizona’s first-ever “sanctuary city.” Councilmembers were required to vote after the measure got more than the minimum required number of petition signatures. The initiative would add protections for people living in the U.S. illegally. Video shows a woman wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat repeatedly shouting that the initiative defies U.S. immigration law. The footage has since gone viral on social media because of an man in a green polo shirt laughing nearby. #GreenShirtGuy was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter as of Wednesday morning.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is asking lawmakers to approve $25 million for a new state grant program aimed at increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday announced the creation of the Arkansas Rural Connect program, which will provide grants to qualifying communities with at least 500 people to deploy high-speed broadband to residents. Hutchinson, who announced the program at a meeting of the Arkansas Sheriffs’ Association in Rogers, says he’ll ask the Legislative Council to approve $5.7 million for the program this year, and the remainder will need to be appropriated by lawmakers in next year’s legislative session. In May, Hutchinson released a plan to expand rural access to high-speed broadband by 2022.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Actor Danny Trejo played a real-life hero when he helped rescue a baby trapped in an overturned car after two cars collided at an intersection in the Sylmar neighborhood Wednesday. Video aired by KABC-TV shows Trejo at the crash scene. Trejo says he crawled into the wrecked vehicle from one side but couldn’t unbuckle the child’s car seat from that angle. He says another bystander, a young woman, was able to undo the buckle. Together they pulled the baby safely from the wreckage. The Los Angeles Fire Department says three people were taken to a hospital, and there were no life-threatening injuries. The 75-year-old Trejo, an L.A. native, is perhaps best known for playing the character Machete, originally from the “Spy Kids” series.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: State wildlife officials say thousands of tarantulas are expected to start their annual migration through the state soon. The Gazette reports the migration is expected to begin this month through early October. Officials say the Oklahoma brown tarantulas migrate through La Junta, about 176 miles southeast of Denver. Scientists say the majority of the spiders are 10-year-old males looking to mate with females hidden in Colorado’s grasslands. Officials say the peak time to view the migration is mid-September near Comanche National Grassland south of La Junta off U.S. Highway 109. Officials say tarantulas are mostly harmless to humans but have bites that can cause injury or allergic reaction and hairs that can be irritating to the eyes, mouth and nose.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The federal Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into the state’s policy allowing transgender high school athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify. The investigation follows a complaint by the families of three girls who say they were discriminated against by having to compete in track against two athletes who were identified as male at birth. They say that violates Title IX, the federal law designed to ensure equal athletic opportunities for females. The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by their gender identification. Transathlete.com says Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Everyone’s a critic, including Delaware Air National Guard officials who wanted nude images of Adam and Eve depicted in a 50-year-old mural by famed artist Jamie Wyeth to put on some pants. Someone apparently isn’t mooning over the huge, 10-by-30-foot mural that shows the bare buttocks of the Garden of Eden couple. It hangs on a wall of a building at the guard’s 80-acre base at the New Castle County Airport. The mural was created by Wyeth when he served with the Delaware Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. Air National Guard officials have had recent talks about possibly altering or covering up part of the artwork by the well-known painter. Wyeth is the scion of three generations of widely celebrated American artists, including his illustrator grandfather N.C. Wyeth and his late father Andrew Wyeth, one of the best-known painters of the 20th century.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An internal review of D.C. public schools shows more than 30% of employees have expired background checks. News outlets report Chancellor Lewis Ferebee shared the review’s findings with parents Tuesday and in a letter Wednesday. The district launched the review in June after an employee of a private before- and after-school program allegedly kissed and fondled a 13-year-old student on multiple occasions. The district says it discovered the company didn’t conduct proper background checks. Ferebee says by the end of October, all after-school staff, school staff and central office staff will have active background checks. He also says staff will receive more training on how to spot and respond to sexual misconduct cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state is expanding its efforts to eradicate invasive pythons in the Everglades and is working with the federal government to get snake hunters to remote areas of Big Cypress National Preserve. DeSantis announced Wednesday that Florida will double its resources for python removal and that the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Agriculture have a new agreement to begin hunting pythons in 130,000 acres of state parks. He’s directing the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the South Florida Water Management District to work together to research ways to eliminate pythons and to make a python challenge an annual event instead of once every three years. The challenge awards python hunters who capture the most snakes, which have decimated native species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMilton: A farmer says his beloved miniature donkey named Sammy was literally scared to death by this year’s Fourth of July fireworks. Now he and an animal rights group want Georgia to ban rockets that go boom. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker David Ralston and others Wednesday asking for a “Sammy’s law” limiting fireworks to the non-explosive, non-aerial varieties. John Bogino tells WGCL-TV that Sammy and his other farm animals are like pets to him. His pet donkey of 22 years died last month, and he says Sammy wasn’t his first animal to die because of fireworks. He says one of his horses fled explosions in late July several years ago and had to be euthanized due to severe injuries.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists have discovered that a growing pond of water inside a crater is being heated by the Kilauea volcano. The U.S. Geological Survey says temperature readings taken last weekend show that the pool of water in Kilauea’s Halemaumau crater, the former home of a popular lava lake, is about 158 degrees Fahrenheit. For the first time in recorded history, the presence of water in the crater was confirmed last week. Since then, scientists have found two other small pools of water nearby. The crater floor collapsed about 2,000 feet, and the lava lake disappeared last summer as Kilauea stopped erupting for the first time in over 30 years. USGS geologist Matt Patrick told the Associated Press it’s hard to determine how deep the magma chamber is beneath the bottom of the crater floor where the water was found.\n\nIdaho\n\nSpokane: A study by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has found that cougars kill more elk than wolves in the state. The Spokesman-Review reports the study found that wolves accounted for 32% of adult female elk deaths and 28% of elk calf deaths. The study found that cougars accounted for 35% of adult female elk deaths and 45% of elk calf deaths. The study published earlier this year in the Journal of Wildlife Management examined 15 years of data. The study also found that food availability and the severity of winter is the most important factor for elk calf survival. Idaho Department of Fish and Game senior wildlife research biologist Jon Horne says the findings are also likely applicable for Washington, Montana and Canada.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Officials are showcasing one of the most popular attractions of the Illinois State Fair. The butter cow was unveiled Wednesday afternoon at the fairgrounds. The sculpture has been a part of the state fair for almost 100 years. This year’s cow has been sculpted from 800 pounds of recycled butter. The cow stands near the word “Future” to incorporate the theme of the fair, which is “Building Our Future.” The cow is on display at the Dairy Building. Last year, hundreds of pounds of butter were sculpted into a cow by the same Iowa artist, Sarah Pratt. The base had “Land of Lincoln” written on it and included a stovepipe hat, as a nod to Abraham Lincoln. The fair started Thursday and ends Aug. 18.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Rainbow-colored streamers welcomed students back for the first day of classes Thursday at Cathedral High School, a show of support for a gay teacher fired from the Catholic school over the summer. The brightly colored streamers were a silent twist on a long-held Cathedral tradition to decorate “the hill” with toilet paper on the first day of school, but they still spoke volumes. The private high school has been embroiled in a debate over LGBTQ rights since it fired longtime teacher Joshua Payne-Elliott because of his same-sex marriage. Cathedral officials have said they only did so at the order of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, which began requiring employment contracts with “ministerial language” and morality clauses to be used at its schools four years ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: They’ve built it. Now they’re coming. Major League Baseball is headed to town in 2020. The Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees announced Thursday that the two teams will play an official big-league game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site Aug. 13, 2020. “It’s definitely exciting,” says Roman Weinberg, the director of operations for Go the Distance Baseball, which owns the Field of Dreams movie site. “There’s nothing more American than the Field of Dreams and America’s pastime.” The 1989 movie centers on the 1919 White Sox and Shoeless Joe Jackson. Jackson, who was banned by MLB along with seven of his teammates for his alleged role in the White Sox throwing the 1919 World Series, inspires a farmer, played by Kevin Costner, to build a baseball field. The site has since become a tourist attraction, with fans from across the globe flocking to the Iowa cornfield to see it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to impose what some tax experts say would be the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting taxes on online sales, possibly inviting a legal battle. The Department of Revenue issued a notice last week saying any “remote seller” doing business with Kansas residents must register with the department, collect state and local sales taxes, and forward the revenues to the state, starting Oct. 1. It cites a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year allowing states to collect sales taxes on internet sales. Most states now have policies to collect such taxes, but almost all set minimum annual sales or transaction thresholds to exempt small businesses, according to groups tracking tax laws. Kansas is the first to attempt to collect the taxes without exempting any businesses, they said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Amid major legislative efforts to restrict or end abortion in the state, a new poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood finds a majority of likely voters in the commonwealth believe the procedure should remain available. Asked whether it’s important for women to have “access to all of the reproductive health care options available, including abortion,” 65% said yes, according to the poll. Also, 65% said they’d have doubts about a law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion. Just 18% said they believe all abortions should be illegal – though another 37% said abortion should be allowed only in “extreme cases,” such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or to save the life of the woman. And 43% said abortion should be legal with some regulations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPride: A highway marker honoring blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy has been recovered, months after it disappeared. News outlets report Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office received a tip Wednesday that the sign was at a person’s house in Pride, roughly 30 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. Lt. Craig Dabadie says investigators believe a driver ran off the road and knocked the sign off a pole in May. Someone else picked it up as a souvenir. The sign was posted along Louisiana 1, marking the spot where Guy recorded a music video. The marker honors the Louisiana native’s legacy in music. Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 23 on its list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists.” No arrests were made, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal program designed to help farmers suffering due to trade disruption is unlikely to assist the state’s wild blueberry growers. Maine is the sole commercial producer of wild blueberries in the United States. The industry has struggled in recent years with falling crop sizes and low prices to farmers. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal has called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include the crop in its Market Facilitation Program, which is slated to provide billions to growers negatively impacted by foreign trade retaliation. But the USDA said in a statement that the program is intended for crops that aren’t easily used in school food programs or through food banks. Wild blueberries sometimes fill those needs. The agency says the blueberries remain eligible for other USDA assistance programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The news of Toni Morrison’s death led a west Baltimore artist to create his own version of an ancestral shrine. The Baltimore Sun reports that 50-year-old Ernest Shaw Jr. completed a mural of the celebrated artist and Nobel laureate by Tuesday, just a day after Morrison’s death. Shaw says he considers the death of the 88-year-old Morrison to be the acquiring of an ancestor. He says creating the mural was his way of pouring libations, a reference to a ritual used to honor ancestors and deities. He says there’s no death in dying as Morrison has just transitioned to now work with “the other side.” The spontaneous mural dedicated to “TONI M” covers a Graffiti Alley wall behind Motor House and took several hours to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Ever since “Boston Strong” became a rallying cry after the Boston Marathon bombing, the idea of “strong” has become an inescapable part of how this country heals after tragedy. People mourning this past weekend’s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas have rallied around the slogans “Dayton Strong” and “El Paso Strong.” After many tragedies, the mantra has been used in social media posts, memorials, pins, stickers and other mementos. Massachusetts resident Christopher Dobens co-created the blue and yellow “Boston Strong” T-shirts that helped rocket the phrase into the national lexicon. He says the idea was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong cancer foundation and the U.S. Army’s “Army Strong” slogan. Dobens says it’s heartbreaking to see so many places have had to adopt the “strong” mantra because of violence.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: State and federal agencies are gearing up for a celebration of Smokey Bear’s 75-year legacy of preventing forest fires. Smokey will join staffers with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other partners Friday at Straits State Park in St. Ignace. A family-friendly birthday party is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. It will feature a fire truck open house, displays of wildland fire equipment, fire-prevention games, refreshments and an opportunity to meet the iconic bear. Smokey has shared fire-prevention messages with the signature phrase, “Only you can prevent wildfires.” Debbie Begalle of the Michigan DNR’s Forest Resources Division says the slogan is still relevant. Nine out of 10 wildfires are started by people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Department of Natural Resources has denied requests to reconsider the tailings dam permits that it issued for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The DNR said Wednesday that opponents did not raise any new issues that materially affect its 2018 decision granting the permits. The Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa and environmental groups asked the DNR to reconsider in light of tailings dam failures elsewhere. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a statement that her agency studied the failures but remains confident in the safety of the PolyMet dam. The DNR issued its decision one day after the Minnesota Court of Appeals stayed a different permit for the mine, governing water pollution, pending a court investigation into potential irregularities in how state and federal regulators handled that permit.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Hurricane Katrina left lasting scars on the Hurricane Camille Memorial at the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. The church reached out to the Biloxi Fire Department, which, in turn, reached out to Lodging and Leisure Investments for help in returning the memorial to its best condition in light of the storm’s upcoming 50th anniversary. Officials tell WLOX-TV restoring the tile mosaic is the greatest challenge in the project. Other work includes power washing and cleaning each name on the memorial’s walls. Camille’s 50th anniversary will include a memorial service at the memorial site at 5 p.m. Aug. 17. Afterward, a program will be held at the Seafood & Maritime Industry Museum at 6 p.m.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Attorney General Eric Schmitt says counting of untested rape kits in the state is nearly complete. Schmitt said Wednesday that 95.6% of law enforcement agencies and 98.5% of hospitals and Veterans Affairs medical facilities have completed their inventory of sexual assault evidence kits. Former Attorney General Josh Hawley began an audit of the backlog in 2017 after the Columbia Missourian reported Missouri had never done a statewide review of untested rape kits. Schmitt began a SAFE Kits Initiative in February and appointed Judge M. Keithley Williams to lead the effort to eliminate the backlog of sexual assault kits. The counting project received funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Rape kits contain DNA samples and other evidence from medical procedures conducted immediately after an attack.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A man charged with assaulting a 13-year-old boy who refused to remove his hat during the national anthem believed he was doing what President Donald Trump wanted him to do, his attorney says. Attorney Lance Jasper told the Missoulian he will seek a mental health evaluation for Curt Brockway, a U.S. Army veteran who became caught up in the heightened animosity and rhetoric gripping the nation and convinced himself he was following the president’s orders. “His commander in chief is telling people that if they kneel, they should be fired, or if they burn a flag, they should be punished,” Jasper said. He said Brockway “certainly didn’t understand it was a crime.” Brockway suffered a traumatic brain injury in a vehicle crash in 2000 that has affected his decision making, and Jasper said he plans to raise that in his client’s defense.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The remains of twins who joined the Navy together have been returned to the city for burial, decades after their deaths on a battleship at Pearl Harbor. The Lincoln Journal Star reports two ceremonies will be held in succession Saturday at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery for Rudolph Blitz and brother Leo Blitz. There will be two flag-covered caskets, two 21-gun salutes, two invocations, two flags presented to their surviving sister, 93-year-old Lincoln resident Betty Pitsch. Her DNA contribution helped bring her older brothers home. The 17-year-old twins left Lincoln High to join the Navy in 1938 and had been stationed at Pearl Harbor for a year and a day before the USS Oklahoma went down during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by Japan. Their remains were buried at a Honolulu cemetery and later identified after being unearthed in 2015.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A jumbo jetliner that sparked controversy at last year’s Burning Man festival when it got stuck in the desert for nearly a month has returned for this year’s event after organizers agreed to post a bond for the popular art installation. The Bureau of Land Management granted a special permit to the foundation that converted the 747 into a nightclub. Burning Man officials reviewed the Big Imagination Foundation’s plans before it transported the multi-ton aircraft last weekend to the Black Rock Desert, 100 miles north of Reno. Group leaders haven’t disclosed the cost of the performance bond. They get the money back if they comply with the permit. Critics say the plane severely damaged the playa floor last year when it dug holes into the soft alkali dust and got stuck.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has signed a bill to help the state’s dairy farmers. The purpose of the bill is to provide a way to support dairy farmers by buying specially labeled milk for an extra 50 cents per gallon. The measure creates a dairy premium fund that replaces the milk producers’ emergency relief fund. Money remaining in the fund after payment of the premiums would be available to promote the program. It’s anticipated that the premium milk will be available this fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: Two actors from the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” visited federal immigration detainees at the Hudson County jail Thursday. Vicci Martinez and Emily Tarver met with two female detainees from Jamaica. The actors, whose show tackled issues of immigration detention and family separation in its final season, said they wanted to draw attention to the plight of immigrants in such facilities. The visit was organized by Freedom for Immigrants, an organization that aims to abolish immigration detention and was featured in the final season of the show, and First Friends of New Jersey and New York, a nonprofit that sends volunteers to visit immigrant detainees. After leaving the jail, Tarver recounted the story of the woman she met, a victim of domestic violence who sought help from the police and wound up detained, for four months so far, when her immigration status came into play.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSan Antonio: A federal agency is taking advantage of high water levels in the Rio Grande to help a tiny minnow listed as an endangered species. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation workers recently aided in creating more habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow on the Middle Rio Grande, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Reclamation crews worked from January to March to lower and widen the riverbank on the southern end of private property near Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They excavated 46,000 cubic yards of dirt to create water channels where minnows could escape the fast-moving river. The tiny fish, listed as endangered in 1994, was once abundant throughout the Rio Grande Basin from Colorado to Texas and into Mexico. It’s now found only in a fraction of its historic habitat as the river system has seen dam building and the straightening of its once meandering channels over the past 150 years.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has approved legislation aimed at bolstering the health and safety standards for all pet dealers operating in the state. The bill signed Thursday calls for separate spaces for pregnant animals and requires all enclosures be cleaned daily and disinfected at least once every two weeks. “Pet dealers must be held to standards that will promote the safety, good health, and overall well-being of the animals in their care,” says a memo attached to the bill. Under the new law, which takes effect in 90 days, pet dealers are required to regularly groom animals to prevent matting and flea and tick infestations and provide animals with diurnal lighting cycles, which mimic natural, 24-hour light patterns. And any for-profit dealer selling, or planning to sell, at least 25 cats or dogs in a year must provide an annual veterinary checkup for each animal.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: The city is being recognized for its commitment to preserving monarch butterflies. Wake Forest announced Wednesday that the recognition was awarded by Monarch City USA, a nonprofit organization that promotes the species and recognizes areas that work on recovering butterfly populations. The nonprofit group says that the butterflies rely on milkweed and nectar plants. The butterfly’s population has declined as the plants have dwindled. Wake Forest, northeast of Raleigh, features the plants that attract the butterflies at E. Carroll Joyner Park. The town has installed signs that identify the butterfly habitat and one noting Wake Forest’s designation as a “Monarch City USA.” The nonprofit says it’s the first in the state to receive the designation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two environmental groups who say regulators should have intervened in the location of an oil refinery near the state’s top tourist attraction, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, are taking their case to the state Supreme Court. The Public Service Commission last year declined to review whether the refinery could be built just 3 miles from the park in the western Badlands, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators concluded the proposed $800 million Davis Refinery would be too small to warrant review under state law. The Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council don’t believe developer Meridian Energy Group is being forthright about the refinery’s size and asked a state judge to force the commission to hold a hearing. South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick refused in May, ruling that the PSC followed state law.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringdale: A long-standing community event is facing backlash on social media. A Facebook post promoting Springdale’s annual Goldfish Swim has garnered more than 3,500 comments, most outraged, since it was posted Aug. 1. The end-of-summer event has been going on for almost 40 years. More than 4,700 people have signed a Change.org petition to stop the event, saying it is “obvious” animal abuse. City officials take 1,000 feeder goldfish and put them in the Springdale Community Center Pool. Children under the age of 12 try to catch the fish with their bare hands, take them home and care for them. “No nets, poles or help from mom and dad. Bring a plastic bucket to take your new pet home,” the post about the event says. The event is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Springdale Pool.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Police were justified when they fatally shot a black teenager who was naked and unarmed, an attorney for the city argues in a response to a civil rights lawsuit filed by the teen’s parents. The parents of Isaiah Mark Lewis contend in their federal lawsuit that Sgt. Milo Box and Officer Denton Scherman used excessive force and acted “unnecessarily and unjustly” when they hit their 17-year-old son with a stun gun and then fatally shot him April 29 after he allegedly broke into a home. In a response filed Wednesday on behalf of the city, attorney Taylor Clark denies that the city violated Lewis’ constitutional rights and says: “Lewis was justifiably shot by a service weapon after being ineffectively tasered.” “Edmond also admits that Isaiah Mark Lewis was naked and unarmed when he was shot and that verbal commands were given to Isaiah Mark Lewis prior to the shooting,” Clark wrote. The officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Taylor declined further comment.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge has ruled that the state Fish and Wildlife Commission illegally reversed an earlier decision granting endangered species status to the marbled murrelet, a small seabird that nests in old-growth forests. Environmental groups say Oregon has sought to avoid protections for the bird, allowing clear-cut logging in its habitat. A spokeswoman for the wildlife department said it won’t comment on legal matters. The ruling was by Lane County Circuit Court Judge Lauren Holland in Eugene. Conservation groups said they petitioned the wildlife commission to list the marbled murrelet as endangered, and it voted to do so, concluding the bird was likely to go extinct. But the commission reversed itself without explanation. Holland said the commission was required to explain its reversal and failed to do so.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia’s Music Alliance will induct musicians spanning a wide range of genres to its Walk of Fame, including The Philadelphia Orchestra, R&B group The O’Jays and ’80s rock band The Hooters. The class of 2019’s other honorees include Philadelphia socialite and philanthropist Dorrance “Dodo” Hamilton, who died in 2017; disco queen Evelyn “Champagne” King; and Jody Gerson, the current CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group and the first woman to run a major music-publishing company. Longtime rock-radio DJ Pierre Robert is this year’s dual Radio Row Award recipient and Walk of Fame inductee. The announcements were made Wednesday at the Independence Visitor Center. The group will be formally inducted Oct. 22 during a gala at The Bellevue.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo says the state will begin offering a gender-neutral option for residents to put on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates. Rhode Island will join the ranks of about a dozen other states already offering an option of “X” instead of the standard “M” or “F.” The option is in response to the governor’s conversations with the transgender and LGBTQ community. The Democratic governor says this is “just basic fairness” in order to ensure all residents are being recognized for who they are. The Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health echoed the governor’s remarks. The governor adds that the biggest hurdle has been the implementation of the change. Residents could potentially see the option available within a year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAiken: Officials say the U.S. government followed a requirement to remove weapons-grade plutonium from the state. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 1 metric ton of nuclear material has been shipped out of the Savannah River Site near Aiken. The U.S. Energy Department was ordered in 2017 to remove that much plutonium by January. Federal court records said half the plutonium was sent to Nevada. Wilson’s statement Wednesday didn’t say where the other half was shipped. South Carolina sued the federal agency after it halted a plan to turn plutonium once used to make nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors. The Energy Department owes the state $200 million in fines in part because 11 metric tons of plutonium remain at the site.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBurke: As this small town recovers from a tornado that destroyed its civic center and caused other extensive damage, some residents are asking why the community’s warning siren wasn’t sounded. The EF-1 tornado with 100 mph winds ripped through Burke on Tuesday night, ripping roofs off buildings and homes, uprooting trees and leaving the school building unusable for the beginning of classes. Two men suffered minor injuries when a garage collapsed. Gov. Kristi Noem visited the community Wednesday and called the damage “unbelievable.” Noem promised the state’s help in the community’s restoration efforts. Burke Mayor Thomas Glover says the siren is sounded when officials get notification of a tornado sighting or that one is imminent. Glover says that did not happen.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Add Glen Campbell to the list of late country music legends with a museum in their honor in the city’s downtown. Clearbrook Hospitality LLC announced plans Thursday to open The Glen Campbell Museum and Rhinestone Stage, a live music venue, at the corner of Broadway and 2nd Avenue. It’s slated to open in early 2020. Campbell died in 2017 at age 81 following an extended battle with Alzheimer’s disease. The 4,000-square-foot venue will feature immersive, interactive displays showcasing different stages of Campbell’s career. He was a studio musician in The Wrecking Crew; the singer of many hit records including “Rhinestone Cowboy” and “Southern Nights”; and a television and film actor. In the evenings, the museum will transform into live music venue The Rhinestone Stage, where national and local acts can perform intimate shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is coming this weekend. The Texas Comptroller’s Office says the tax break begins Friday and runs through Sunday. Customers can buy most clothing, footwear, school supplies and backpacks – sold for less than $100 – tax free from a Texas store or from an online or catalog seller doing business in the state. The sales tax exemption applies only to qualifying items. The tax break does not include products such as jewelry, handbags, briefcases, luggage, computer bags, umbrellas, wallets and watches. The Texas sales tax holiday weekend started in 1999.\n\nUtah\n\nRiverton: Administrators from more than 60 schools in northern Utah gathered ahead of the first day of classes to assemble “care kits” for students in need. The Deseret News reports administrators from the Jordan School District met Wednesday to pack more than 2,400 kits, which include food, personal hygiene products and backpacks loaded with school supplies. Walmart donated the supplies. Event organizer Peggy Margetts said the kits help students in a discrete way and show students their school cares about their well-being. Students will receive the kits at the start of school. Administrators said they will keep some on hand to use during the year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets says the state’s cheese producers won 44 ribbons at the American Cheese Society’s annual awards competition. Officials say this is Vermont’s best showing yet. The results were announced at the society’s annual conference last week in Richmond, Virginia. Agriculture officials say five Vermont cheeses were finalists for the best in show. A total of 25 Vermont companies submitted cheeses to be judged among the more than 2,000 total entries. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott congratulated the state’s cheesemakers on their “impressive achievement.” He says their “commitment to excellence is helping Vermont grow its economy by creating jobs and further strengthening our great Vermont brand.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Town officials are cracking down on an unsanctioned Virginia Tech fraternity they say is operating in violation of zoning rules. Blacksburg officials recently determined the house is being used as a base for the rogue frat Omega Alpha Kappa. Zoning Administrator Paul Patterson said frat activities at the house must stop. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the fraternity is not recognized by the university and was formed by members of Kappa Delta Rho when that chapter was suspended for violating alcohol policies. The fraternity has a history of trash citations and accusations that members made female guests at social events feel uncomfortable. The Roanoke Times reports the university has advised students to avoid the fraternity and seven others for their safety.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A $219 million property-tax levy that would abolish overdue fines in the Seattle Public Library system is heading toward approval. The Seattle Times reports the seven-year levy supporting the library system had 73% of the vote in returns Tuesday. The measure proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan would authorize additional property taxes and replace a $123 million library levy set to expire at the end of this year. The levy would collect about 12 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value in 2020. The additional library funding would support seismic renovations, new programs for children, more social workers, extended operating hours and the elimination of fines for overdue items. About $167 million would be used to maintain current services.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Public Port Authority board has decided to consider lease proposals and bids for the Heartland Intermodal Gateway Facility in Prichard. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board made a motion Wednesday in Charleston to delay a possible public sale. West Virginia Transportation Secretary Byrd White says the board discussed selling it because of a funding shortage. Wayne County Commissioner Jeff Maddox says the county’s economy isn’t the best, but a sale for “pennies on the dollar” would be “a grave error.” The board will further discuss options at its September meeting. The $32 million facility opened in 2015 on 76 acres donated by Norfolk Southern railroad. It’s designed to move containers more efficiently by rail through a double-stack method while offering a cheaper alternative to gas-guzzling trucks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State prison officials say they illegally released information that could reveal whether inmates are in substance abuse treatment. The Department of Corrections said Thursday that officials responding to an open records request released records June 24 that contained 1,041 inmates’ personal identification numbers and locations. No names were released, but DOC officials say someone could use the numbers and locations to learn whether an inmate is at a substance abuse facility or receiving treatment. The agency says that information is confidential under Wisconsin law. Only two people saw the information, and they’ve since confirmed the data has been destroyed. DOC spokeswoman Molly Vidal didn’t answer emailed questions asking who received the questions and what information they actually wanted.\n\nWyoming\n\nMeeteetse: A ranch where black-footed ferrets were discovered in the 1980s is being preserved. The Nature Conservancy recently announced a conservation easement agreement to restrict the Lazy BV ranch’s 2,300 acres near Meeteetse from being subdivided or developed. The ranch is in the area where the ferrets were discovered in 1981 after they were thought to be extinct. The ferrets were used to start a captive-breeding program that has restored black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and elsewhere in the western U.S. Jim Luchsinger of The Nature Conservancy tells Wyoming Public Radio it had been a dream of the ranch owners to protect the ranch and bring ferrets back. The protected land is also home to greater sage grouse, mule deer, antelope and Yellowstone cutthroat trout.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/12/09/county-balks-size-kolter-homes-senior-complex-loxahatchee/10806846002/", "title": "County balks at size of Kolter Homes' senior complex in Loxahatchee", "text": "The county commission endorsed:\n\n-A 117-home community near Lake Worth Beach.\n\n-A 166-home community near Boynton Beach.\n\n-70 homes near Boca Raton.\n\nLOXAHATCHEE — The 892-home seniors community that Kolter Homes has proposed in the western end of Palm Beach County may be in trouble.\n\nCounty commissioners have had concerns about whether such a high-density project at Cresswind in the rural Loxahatchee area was appropriate.

Kim Reynolds signs disaster proclamation for 12 counties\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a disaster relief proclamation on Saturday morning for 12 counties in eastern Iowa in the wake of the storm damage.\n\nThe proclamation intends to \"ease restrictions on the transportation of materials related to disaster response and repairs,\" according to a press release. Those measures include temporarily suspending restrictions on hours of service for disaster relief crews and movement of loads on highways to help in disaster recovery.\n\nThe counties included in the proclamation are Cedar, Clinton, Delaware, Des Moines, Dubuque, Grundy, Johnson, Keokuk, Linn, Mahaska, Wapello and Washington.\n\nThe Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program is now also available for residents of those counties impacted by the disaster whose household annual income is at 200% or less than the federal poverty level.

Residents were able to return to their homes last night, according to Clinton County Emergency Management Coordinator Chance Kness.\n\nKness said several homes across the county were destroyed by the strong storms. He said eyewitness accounts confirmed at least one tornado touched down in the county, but his team is awaiting confirmation from the National Weather Service.\n\nEmergency personnel rescued a family of three trapped in their collapsed home north of Grand Mound last night at 6 p.m., Kness said. One of the residents was transported to Genesis Medical Center in DeWitt for their injuries, he said.\n\nKness said emergency personnel worked efficiently to survey damage and respond to calls for service in the county, thanks in large part to early warnings ahead of the storm.\n\n\"Because of the extremely early warning about the severity of this event, we had staffed our Emergency Operations Center, notified responders,\" he said. \"We're very fortunate in Clinton County to have excellent first response capabilities and great working relationships.

Johnson County Emergency Management Coordinator Dave Wilson said there may have been up to three tornadoes that hit the county.\n\nThe tornadoes first were sighted in the southwest corner of the county, in Frytown, and made their way up through the west side of Hills, he said.\n\nIn Hills, \"about a six-block-wide area between Highway 218 and the railroad tracks\" sustained notable damage, he said. The area is made up of apartment buildings, a few individual residences and commercial storage sheds, he said.\n\nFrom there, the storm moved to the west of Iowa City over the city's landfill and ended up in Coralville, where a portion of four blocks stretching from Highway 6 to Boston Way sustained damage, he said. The storm then \"hopped up\" to Solon, Wilson said, where it damaged a new subdivision under construction and took the roof off a local hardware store and Mexican restaurant.

In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports. The high at Central Park was 15 degrees, marking it the second-coldest December 24 in at least 150 years, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound later in the week with a much-welcomed warming trend with above-normal temperatures.\n\nAbout 250,000 homes and businesses in the US had no electricity service as of about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, with nearly half of those affected in Maine and New York, according to PowerOutage.us.

The annual Moundville Native American Festival will be held from Wednesday to Saturday at the University of Alabama Moundville Archaeological Park. This will mark the first in-person festival since 2019, as the event was held online only the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of visitors are expected at the festival, which began 34 years ago. “The festival is one the largest events that brings people to the park every year,” said Clay Nelson, director of the UA Moundville Archaeological Park. Holding the festival online was the best option for the past couple of years, but Nelson said there’s no substitute for seeing up close the park’s attractions, which include 29 massive flat-topped earthen mounds. “We can describe the earthen mounds as much as we want, but seeing them in person really helps illustrate what great engineering feats the indigenous peoples of Alabama were doing in the 13th century,” he said. The festival will feature artists, craftsmen and educators from around the nation, who’ll share their knowledge of Native American culture. People will be able to buy Native crafts and food, as well as traditional festival fare.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fall storm packing strong winds damaged roofs and windows in parts of western and northwest Alaska and resulted in flooding of roads in the far northern city of Utqiagvik, according to damage reports, with a new storm expected to hit the Arctic coast this week.

Eckerstrom said Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate had shown they are likely to prevail on an appeal of a decision by the judge in Tucson to allow enforcement of the old law. Planned Parenthood had argued that the lower court judge should have considered a host of laws restricting abortions passed since the original injunction was put in place following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. Those laws include a new one blocking abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that took effect last month. The previous limit was 24 weeks, the viability standard established by now-overruled U.S. Supreme Court cases. “Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state’s relevant statutes,” Eckerstrom wrote, mirroring arguments made by attorneys for Planned Parenthood.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two deputies who were caught on video violently arresting a suspect outside a convenience store in August have been fired, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Thursday. Damante told Fort Smith television station KHBS that Levi White and Zachary King had been fired but did not elaborate on the decision. A bystander recorded White, King and Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle arresting 27-year-old Randal Worcester outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said Riddle remains on administrative leave. The bystander’s video of the Aug. 21 arrest shows one of the deputies repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down, while a third kneed him over and over. Damante has said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma. Damante said Worcester tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. The deputy suffered a concussion, Damante said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Geological Survey has released updated tsunami hazard maps for seven counties to help users determine whether they are in areas at risk for inundation and for planning. The revised interactive maps released Friday cover San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ventura, Marin, Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. The new maps reflect new data and improved computer modeling since an earlier series of maps was published in 2009, as well as threats from tsunamis originating far away and locally, the Geological Survey said in a press release. In one example of the updates, new modeling for Santa Cruz County shows that a subduction zone earthquake off the Aleutian Islands could unleash a tsunami 18-25 feet above the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, more than double the height suggested in 2009, the agency said. The Geological Survey said California’s shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been significantly destructive and deadly. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City, California, hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A police officer who arrested a woman who was seriously injured when the parked patrol car in which she was placed was struck by a freight train said he did not realize he had stopped the vehicle on the railroad tracks, according to police body camera video. In video obtained by KUSA-TV on Thursday, Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez told another officer he thought he had cleared the tracks when he stopped Yareni Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16 in a suspected road rage case involving a gun. He said he pulled up right behind her truck and was focused on her because he was concerned about weapons. Vazquez also said he did not know another officer had put Rios-Gonzalez in Vasquez’s patrol vehicle until after it was hit by the train. He said the “saving grace” was that the other officer put Rios-Gonzalez on the side of the vehicle not usually used for arrested people. Rios-Gonzalez’s injuries included nine broken ribs, a broken arm and a fractured sternum. Her lawyer has said he plans to file a lawsuit against police. Previously released video from Vazquez’s body camera shows he asks the other officer several times over the sound of the train’s rumbling whether Rios-Gonzalez was in the patrol vehicle, and she responds, one hand to her face, “Oh my God, yes, she was!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Jurors concluded their first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict Friday in a trial to determine how much conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay for spreading the lie that the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. Jurors are scheduled to return Tuesday. After deliberating just briefly Thursday afternoon, the panel got back to business Friday with a request for a dry-erase easel, markers, an eraser and a copy of the jury instructions. Last year, Jones was found liable for damages. The jury’s task is to decide how much Jones and his company Free Speech Systems should pay to relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and to an FBI agent who responded to the massacre. The plaintiffs testified they have been tormented and threatened by people who believed that one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history was a con staged to build support for gun restrictions. Jones repeatedly publicized that false notion on his “Infowars” show. Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Jones testified in the trial, saying he was “done saying I’m sorry.” His lawyers have argued that he’s not responsible for the deeds of anyone who tormented the victims’ families, and that they are overstating how much harm it caused them.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: New state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled Friday. In a three-page order, the justices said the vote-by-mail statute impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified in Delaware’s constitution. The same-day registration law conflicts with the registration periods spelled out in the state constitution, they said. The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday. Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook last month upheld the same-day registration law but said the vote-by-mail law, the result of legislation Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks, violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting. Both bills were passed in June, each receiving exactly one Republican vote, and were signed by Democratic Gov. John Carney in July. Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jennings appealed Cook’s ruling striking down the vote-by-mail law. GOP attorneys representing voters, a state House candidate and a Department of Elections employee appealed Cook’s decision upholding same-day registration. The Supreme Court upheld Cook’s ruling on the vote-by-mail law but said his decision allowing same-day registration should be reversed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Air and Space Museum will reopen half of its flagship building to the public on the National Mall on Friday, WUSA-TV reports. When the museum partially reopens, visitors can check out eight new and renovated exhibitions, along with the planetarium on the museum’s west end. Highlights include “Destination Moon,” which will display the Apollo 11 space suit; “Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery,” which will feature an immersive experience called Walking on Other Worlds; and the “Thomas W. Haas We All Fly” exhibition, which will include the Challenger III and the Lear Jet 23. The museum has been undergoing a seven-year renovation that began in 2018 and includes redesigning all 23 exhibitions and presentation spaces, replacing outdated mechanical systems and other repairs and improvements. “You should be excited to engage with these pieces of history, these real artifacts, these real things,” said Beth Wilson, an educator with the museum. “Come and see them.” Free timed-entry passes are required to visit the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida officials began planning to transport migrants to other states in July and told potential contractors their task would be to relocate them on a voluntary basis, according to state documents. The documents released Friday night provide new details about the program that culminated in the Sept. 14 flight of 48 mostly Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off Massachusetts. The flight has spawned an investigation by a Texas sheriff and two lawsuits amid criticism that the program was a political stunt by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appeal to his conservative base. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and is frequently mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to the documents, the program as outlined in July was intended to “assist in the voluntary relocation of Unauthorized Aliens who are found in Florida and have agreed to be relocated” elsewhere in the country. It made no mention of finding migrants in Texas. Ultimately, state officials chose Vertol Systems Co., based in Destin, Florida, and has so far paid the firm $1.56 million for the Martha’s Vineyard flight and possibly for a second flight to Delaware, the home state of President Joe Biden, that didn’t happen. No other flights have been announced.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 election filed paperwork Friday seeking to compel testimony from a new batch of Trump allies, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis filed petitions in court seeking to have Gingrich and Flynn, as well as former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and others, testify next month before a special grand jury that’s been seated to aid her investigation. They join a string of other high-profile Trump allies and advisers who have been called to testify in the probe. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump attorney who’s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe, testified in August. Attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro have also appeared before the panel. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s attempt to fight his subpoena is pending in a federal appeals court. And paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has said she plans to take a monthlong break from public activity in the case leading up to the November midterm election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, is in a “state of heightened unrest” but is not erupting, and there are no signs of an imminent eruption, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday. Earlier in the week week, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed the Mauna Loa summit backcountry until further notice, calling it a “precautionary measure” amid “elevated seismic activity.” The observatory said the heightened unrest began in mid-September, “as recorded by an increase in earthquakes below Mauna Loa summit.” The volcano, which stands about 13,680 feet above sea level on the island of Hawaii, last erupted in 1984, the observatory said. Since 1843, it has erupted 33 times, with the time between eruptions ranging from months to decades, according to the observatory. The park’s online portal says this is the volcano’s “longest quiet period since written records have been kept.” “Mauna Loa will erupt again,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “As long as there is heightened unrest, it is more likely to erupt. But it could be weeks or months – or it could eventually die off.” The latter happened the last time there was elevated seismic activity and summit expansion on Mauna Loa, in early 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court heard arguments in lawsuits over three of Idaho’s abortion laws Thursday, sharply questioning attorneys about the value placed on a pregnant person’s health, the state’s interest in ensuring that pregnancies are carried to term and Idaho’s long history of anti-abortion laws. The high court earlier this year allowed the laws to go into effect, and as a result Idaho is one of several states where abortion is almost entirely outlawed. A final ruling on the laws – including one that criminalizes all abortions but allows physicians to defend themselves by showing the abortion was needed to save the pregnant persopn’s life, one that criminalizes most abortions after about six weeks’ gestation, and one that allows even extended potential relatives of a fetus or embryo to sue an abortion provider – could be handed down sometime in the coming months. “For 50 years, generations of Idaho women have had control over their bodies and lives with respect to the most intimate personal and private decision imaginable whether to carry a pregnancy to term or whether to terminate it,” Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney representing a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, told the court. “The Idaho Legislature seeks to upend women’s lives and strip them of this fundamental right – one that’s necessary to the exercise of numerous other rights that all Idahoans cherish.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man accused of walking into a Chicago police station and pointing a gun at officers, leading police to shoot and wound him, appeared in court Friday on assault charges, where a judge ordered his bond set at $200,000. The police department said in a news release that 43-year-old Terrick Bland, of nearby Maywood, is charged with five counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer and one felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to police, Bland walked into the lobby of the Ogden District station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city’s West Side and began shouting anti-police statements Wednesday. When officers ordered him to drop a gun that he had wrapped in a plastic bag, he pointed it at officers, and at least three of them opened fire. Bland was shot once in the shoulder and was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, Bland was represented at Friday’s hearing by an attorney with the county public defender’s office. An official from the office said she could not immediately determine who represented Bland. It was the second time in a little more than a week in which Chicago officers shot an armed suspect inside of a police station.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region. State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday after determining that the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with four horses testing positive for the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus “is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana” until the first hard freeze of the fall season occurs. As of Tuesday, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said two horses in LaGrange County and one horse in Kosciusko County had tested positive for the virus. No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, “humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk.” Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects. While rare, the virus can cause serious illness with long-term complications and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Paddlers on the Cedar River now will be floating on designated waters. The river, from Janesville to around La Porte City – about 46 miles – has been formally recognized as a designated water trail as part of the Cedar Valley Nature Trail. A 14-mile stretch of Black Hawk Creek from Hudson to the Cedar River was also designated as an official water trail. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports members of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Black Hawk County Conservation, Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments and Partnership for a Healthy Iowa paddled from Washington Park in Cedar Falls to the Waterloo Boat House in celebration of the new identification. Kayla Lyon, director of the Iowa DNR, said there are more than 1,000 miles of designated water trails in the state. The state’s first designated water trail was the Cedar Valley Paddler’s Trail in Black Hawk County, which begins at the Fisher Lake Boat Ramp. The 10-mile trail was recognized in 2005. Peter Komendowski, executive director of the Partnership for a Healthy Iowa, said the waterway was first paddled by 26 eighth graders and adults, and it took them more than six hours. It travels through a chain of lakes, down the Cedar River and through George Wyth State Park before looping back to the start.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Wichita police officer was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of drunken driving, becoming the city’s third officer to be apprehended within about two weeks. Police said in a release that the officer, who was off-duty, is also facing a charge of possession of a gun while intoxicated. The officer, who has been with the department for two years, has been placed on administrative leave while a criminal and internal investigation is conducted, the Wichita Eagle reports. The incident follows two other arrests of Wichita officers within five days at the end of last month. A detective and 15-year veteran of the force was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Sept. 23 after she collided with a city bus in downtown. A police recruit was arrested on suspicion of criminal threat Sept. 28 when police responded to a domestic violence call.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday to block Kentucky’s laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution. Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of “an unborn child” begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception but rather at birth, while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky “has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.” Their complaint, filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court, says Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus. “As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me; it affects my health care,” lead plaintiff Lisa Sobel said. “And then it’s a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Democratic challenger to U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise released a campaign ad on social media that includes video of her giving birth. Katie Darling said she was seven months pregnant when she decided to join the congressional race in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that ended constitutional protections for abortion. The 75-second video documents Darling traveling from her family farm in St. Tammany parish in September to a hospital, where she grips the side of a bed while in labor. “I wanted to share that this is real for me,” Darling, 36, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “I am literally the one hooked up to the machines and the IVs in the hospital bed, going through childbirth, and nobody else should be deciding how I handle that.” In a voiceover, Darling highlights her concerns about climate change, Louisiana underperforming in education and the state’s near-total abortion ban – the only exceptions are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. “Louisiana deserves better than the path it’s on,” Darling says in the video. “I want that better path,” she adds, “for you” – as the ad pans to her husband in the delivery room. “For her,” as a the video shows her 6-year-old daughter. “And for him,” she says directly into the camera from her hospital bed as she cradles her newborn.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Wildlife agencies are finding elevated levels of a class of toxic chemicals in game animals such as deer, prompting health advisories in some places where hunting and fishing are ways of life and key pieces of the economy. Authorities have detected the high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in deer in several states, including Maine, where legions of hunters seek to bag a buck every fall. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched an effort last year to limit pollution from the chemicals, linked to health problems including cancer and low birth weight. In Maine, where the chemicals were detected in well water at hundreds of times the federal health advisory level, legislators passed a law in 2021 requiring manufacturers to report their use of the chemicals and to phase them out by 2030. The state issued a “do not eat” advisory last year for deer harvested in the Fairfield area, about 80 miles north of Portland, after several of the animals tested positive for elevated levels. The state is now expanding the testing to more animals across a wider area, said Nate Webb, wildlife division director at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. “Lab capacity has been challenging,” he said, “but I suspect there will be more facilities coming online to help ease that burden.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The office of the state’s attorney general is supporting an appeal by a slain woman’s family after a Baltimore judge overturned a man’s murder conviction in a case chronicled by a groundbreaking podcast. Hae Min Lee’s brother, Young Lee, has asked the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to halt court proceedings for Adnan Syed, whose conviction in Lee’s 1999 killing was reversed by Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn in September. Young Lee is asking the appellate court to suspend an Oct. 18 deadline for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges against Syed or retry him. Lee argues that his family didn’t get adequate notice of the Sept. 19 hearing at which Phinn overturned Syed’s conviction. Attorney General Brian Frosch’s office, which represented the state in opposing Syed’s appeals, said in a court filing Friday that Young Lee has a right to appeal given his status as the victim’s representative, the Baltimore Sun reports. The filing argues that Lee’s appeal should be addressed before any circuit court rulings render it moot. Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, has served more than 20 years of a life sentence. He was convicted of strangling Lee, whose body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were students at a Baltimore County high school.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials said Friday that they’re concerned about elevated levels of the coronavirus in the city’s wastewater. The concentration of the virus in local wastewater had increased by 3.1% over the prior week and by nearly 100% over the past two weeks, according to new data from last week from the Boston Public Health Commission. New COVID-19 cases in Boston had decreased slightly over the prior week, though the data did not include positive results from at-home tests, the commission said. Boston hospitals had 170 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 last week. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the public health commissioner, said the elevated concentration in the wastewater is “very concerning” because increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, combined with flu season, will cause “major strain” on Boston’s health care system. Ojikutu said it’s important to try to get ahead of the issue and recommended that people get booster shots and flu shots, wear a mask indoors, get tested for COVID-19 and isolate if they test positive to help reduce transmission. Nearly 79% of Boston residents are fully inoculated against the disease. The commission began noticing elevated coronavirus levels in the wastewater in late September.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed another extension of a law that makes people convicted of crimes, typically with low incomes, responsible for a portion of local court expenses. The law, which raises millions of dollars for local governments, doesn’t apply to others who use Michigan’s court system. It has been criticized, even by judges, as unfair at minimum and unconstitutional at worst. The state Supreme Court last spring heard a challenge by a man who was ordered to pay $1,200 in Alpena County. But instead of settling the matter, the court said it would hear more arguments during its 2022-23 term. The Legislature in September voted to keep the law going for an additional 18 months. Only 17 lawmakers opposed it. Whitmer, a Democrat, said she signed the extension last week. Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, acknowledged it puts another “Band-Aid on this issue” while a long-term court funding solution can be explored. A group called the Fines and Fees Justice Center tracks how states impose fines and fees in courts. Co-director Lisa Foster said Michigan stands out because judges who preside over a criminal case are also given power to order financial penalties that benefit local government. People convicted of crimes can be ordered to pay a portion of staff salaries and building maintenance.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Fleet Farm on Wednesday, alleging the retailer negligently sold firearms to two straw buyers, including one gun that was used in a shootout in a St. Paul bar that left one person dead and 14 bystanders injured. The lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges that Fleet Farm ignored multiple red flags that should have tipped off chain officials, including sales of multiple guns in single purchases. It alleges that Fleet Farm stores sold the two at least 37 firearms over a 16-month period. Most of the guns have not been recovered, Ellison said. Ellison, a Democrat, is facing a stiff reelection challenge from Republican candidate Jim Schultz, who has made violent crime his top issue. “We comply with all applicable gun laws and devote substantial resources to training and compliance,” countered Fleet Farm spokesman Jon Austin. He said that after the St. Paul shooting Ellison highlighted, “we were told by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that our team members had ‘done nothing wrong’ and had complied with all applicable gun laws.” The Midwestern company has 17 stores in Minnesota that sell firearms. Straw buyers purchase firearms from licensed retailers and resell them to people who can’t legally buy them or on the black market.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is heading off the threat of a garbage pileup by agreeing to pay its overdue bill for collections the past six months. Even as Jackson struggles with a troubled water system, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City Council have been feuding over the garbage contract for the city of 150,000 residents. Richard’s Disposal has picked up Jackson garbage since April without compensation. The company said it would stop collections after Saturday unless it receives payment. City Council President Ashby Foote told the Associated Press on Friday that the city will pay $4.8 million, and garbage collection will continue. Lumumba awarded an emergency contract early this year to Richard’s after the council voted multiple times against hiring the New Orleans-based company. Jackson has had water problems for years, and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September because torrential rainfall exacerbated problems with the main water treatment plant. Crews are still making emergency repairs to the water plant, and questions remain about the quality of water in the city where 80% of residents are Black, and a quarter live in poverty.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A mother whose son died less than an hour after he was transported from a jail to a state prison has won a $1.2 million settlement in a case that helped lead to suspensions, firings and reforms. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Angela Malcich claimed in the suit that nurses and guards at the St. Louis County Justice Center repeatedly ignored the serious medical distress of her son, Daniel Stout. He was arrested June 3, 2019, on a parole revocation and spent the next eight days in the county jail. The night before his death, Stout complained of stomach pains but was told he would have to wait until the morning to see a nurse, the suit claims. That morning, though, jail staff told a worsening Stout that he would need to wait for care again until he could be transported more than an hour to the state prison in Bonne Terre. Upon arriving, he was vomiting blood and died before emergency crews could get there. An autopsy blamed complications of an ulcer that perforated his intestine. Four other inmates also died in the county jail in 2019, with an internal report finding that all of them had acted “strangely” beforehand and that most were denied medical care.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A draft report from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s housing task force details a slew of ideas to boost housing supply in an effort to tackle Montana’s affordability crunch, previewing legislation that could be advanced during next year’s legislative session, the Montana Free Press reports. Several of the task force’s recommendations involve scaling back local zoning restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, building height limits and parking requirements to make it easier to develop more dense housing developments in urban areas with existing access to services like water lines, streets and fire departments. The report released last week calls for legislation that places “sideboards” on the development restrictions towns and cities have the power to enact and also suggests providing financial incentives to local governments that implement “key regulatory reforms.” The group also suggests putting some state money toward supporting affordable housing efforts. It generally avoids suggestions that seek to address housing challenges with new government regulations, such as restricting AirBnB-style short-term rentals. The task force, which is set to formally present its recommendations to the governor in the coming weeks, is looking for public comment to consider as it finalizes its initial report by a Saturday deadline.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city will have a new tallest building once Mutual of Omaha completes its planned $600 million headquarters tower downtown in 2026. Mutual CEO James Blackledge told the Omaha World-Herald it recently became clear that the insurance company’s new skyscraper would eclipse the 45-story First National Bank tower. The new Mutual building is projected to be 677 feet tall. That would make it 43 feet taller than the First National building that opened in 2002. Mutual didn’t set out to build the city’s tallest building, but Blackledge said he’s proud of the impact the project will have on Omaha’s downtown and its image. “I think people see skylines, and it does create an impression of all the things we want Omaha to be perceived as – a vibrant, growing, thriving place where people can live and work and prosper,” he said. The new building will be designed to hold roughly 2,400 of the company’s 4,000 headquarters workers at any one time, reflecting the rise of working from home. It will also be a little less than half the size of Mutual current 1.7 million-square-foot headquarters complex in midtown Omaha. In conjunction with the Mutual project, Omaha leaders have pledged to build a $306 million, 3-mile-long streetcar line to connect midtown with downtown by sometime in 2026.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Victims of a quick series of stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip described the shock and horror of the unexpected attack Thursday on a group of showgirls and others outside a casino that left two people dead and six injured. Police arrested Yoni Barrios, 32, after a short chase blocks from where they say he attacked four showgirls and ended up stabbing eight people. An arrest report released Friday said Barrios told police some of the victims had laughed at him, and he “let the anger out.” Prosecutors said he’ll be charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me,” said Victoria Caytano, one of the showgirl impersonators who was released from the hospital Friday after she was treated for a stab wound. “I got up, and I started running,” Caytano told KLAS-TV. “I started yelling, ‘He has a knife!’ ” The coroner’s office identified those killed as Las Vegas residents Brent Allan Hallett, 47, and Maris Mareen DiGiovanni, 30. Hallett was stabbed in the back, and DiGiovanni died from a chest wound, authorities said. DiGiovanni was part of the Best Showgirls in Vegas modeling and talent agency, according to Cheryl Lowthorp, who runs the business. She said two others with the agency were among the wounded, and a third escaped without injury.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former juvenile parole officer has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography and trying to send an explicit image to a child. Jason Ellis pleaded guilty in June. Prosecutors agreed in a plea agreement to drop a third charge of distributing child pornography. Ellis was fired from his job as a juvenile parole officer earlier in the year after he was arrested. An affidavit said Ellis sent online messages in 2020 and 2021 to undercover investigators posing as a 13-year-old girl and her father. Detectives uncovered more than 100 images of child sex abuse material on his phone, WMUR-TV reports.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state would sell off all of its pension fund investments in oil, gas and other fossil fuel companies under a bill approved by a New Jersey Senate committee Thursday. The bill targets any pension money invested in 200 of the largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies based on each of their carbon content in oil, gas and coal reserves. It was passed 3-2 along party lines with Democrats in support and Republicans against. “The clock is ticking, and there is not that much time left,” said state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, the bill’s sponsor. “We’ve got to get our industry to change and our economy to change.” The pension fund was valued at $92.9 billion as of May 31, but it is not known exactly how much is invested in fossil fuel company stocks. A state Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a request for that information Thursday. Divest NJ, a group advocating for the measure, estimates it’s between $3 million and $4 million, based on documents it has obtained. The measure had languished in Trenton for almost five years and still has a long road ahead of it. It was moved to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday and would still need to be approved by the full Senate, the Assembly and Gov. Phil Murphy. It would take effect 12 months after being signed into law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has asked the federal Department of Justice to assign more FBI agents to the state in response to violent crime. Lujan Grisham said Wednesday in a statement that she wants to replicate the success of a recent surge in FBI resources and agents in Buffalo, New York. The Sept. 15 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland describes a recent spate of homicides in Albuquerque and says that “additional federal agents are needed to alleviate the current strain on New Mexico’s law enforcement offices.” Lujan Grisham sent a similar request in June to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said the governor’s office did not receive a response from the Department of Justice as of Wednesday evening. Concerns about crime are a prominent theme in the race for governor ahead of the Nov. 8 general election as Lujan Grisham seeks a second term in office. Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Ronchetti has painted a dire portrait of public safety conditions, railing against the state’s bail system and vowing a different approach to judicial appointments.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state police superintendent resigned Friday, days after Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was being investigated for his handling of internal personnel matters. In a statement, Hochul thanked Kevin Bruen for “his years of public service” and said that First Deputy Superintendent Steven Nigrelli will take over as acting superintendent on an interim basis. Bruen had been in charge of the state police since June 2021. A 20-year veteran of the department, he was appointed superintendent by Hochul’s predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bruen’s resignation is effective Oct. 19, the state police said. Hochul told the Albany Times Union’s editorial board on Tuesday that she had ordered her counsel’s office to investigate allegations against Bruen. Among them, according to the newspaper, is whether he had shielded a senior human resources official from complaints about her own handling of personnel issues.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s two top Democratic officials are urging the Republican-led Legislature to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in light of President Joe Biden’s pardon Thursday of thousands of Americans convicted of “simple possession” under federal law. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein, the state’s top lawyer who is considering a run for governor in 2024, shared their support for the president’s decision at a Friday task force meeting on racial equity and criminal justice. Established by Cooper in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, the 24-member panel of law enforcement officers, attorneys, civil rights advocates and state officials had recommended in a 2020 report that state lawmakers replace the misdemeanor charge for possessing up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana with a civil offense on par with a traffic infraction. The General Assembly did not act on this recommendation. “Conviction of simple possession can mar people’s records for life and maybe even prevent them from getting a job,” Cooper told the task force Friday. “The General Assembly didn’t pass your recommendations on this last session, but I believe they should. North Carolina should take steps to end this stigma.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s five American Indian tribes are seeking exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting in North Dakota – a monopoly worth millions – just a year after legislators turned aside a push by one big national player to allow gambling in the state. The tribes are turning to Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to approve the idea under tribal-state agreements known as compacts, the first of which was signed in 1992. The current compacts expire at the end of this year, and only Burgum can approve them, said Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator. The tribes argue their casinos have been hurt by the explosion of electronic pull tab machines statewide after they were legalized in 2017, with North Dakotans pouring almost $1.75 billion into the machines in fiscal 2022. Their proposal, obtained by the Associated Press, is still in draft form. A public hearing on a final proposal is set for Oct. 21, McDaniel said. DraftKings, a big player in the U.S. mobile gambling market, supported legislation and a failed resolution last year to allow sports betting in North Dakota to join about two dozen other states. The company said at the time that sports wagering already is taking place in North Dakota through illegal offshore markets.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A law banning virtually all abortions will remain blocked while a state constitutional challenge proceeds, a judge said Friday in a ruling that will allow pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation to continue for now. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators, and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state’s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn’t ever mention abortion and thus doesn’t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn’t have to be named to be protected. “This court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,” he said. He said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written “to almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.” The state is expected to appeal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nBlanchard: Jody Miller, whose “Queen of the House” won the 1966 Grammy Award for best country performance by a woman, died Thursday at age 80. Miller died in her hometown, Blanchard, of complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to Universal Music Group, owner of Capitol Records, which released most of her hits. “Queen of the House” was released in 1965 as an answer to Roger Miller’s hit “King of the Road.” The hit opened up a crossover career for Jody Miller, who wasn’t related to the “King of the Road” composer and singer. Her 1965 teen protest song “Home of the Brave” was her biggest-selling single, despite being banned from some radio stations’ playlists. Another hit was “Long Black Limousine,” a song about a man’s funeral procession. In the 1970s, Miller moved to Epic Records, where she had hits with “Baby I’m Yours,” “There’s a Party Goin’ On,” “Darling, You Can Always Come Back Home,” and the Grammy-nominated crossover hit cover of “He’s So Fine.” She retired in the 1980s to spend more time with her husband and children. After her husband’s death, she recorded a 2018 single, “Where My Picture Hangs on the Wall,” with daughter Robin Brooks Sullivan and Miller’s two grandchildren.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A serial rapist is set to be released from prison in mid-December after serving nearly 36 years behind bars, almost all of his maximum sentence. Richard Gillmore, arrested in 1986 and called the “jogger rapist” because he staked out victims as he ran by their homes, admitted to raping nine girls in the Portland area in the 1970s and ’80s but was only convicted in one case because of the statute of limitations. In 1987, a jury found him guilty of raping 13-year-old Tiffany Edens, his last known victim, in December 1986. The Associated Press generally does not name people who have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Edens has spoken out about the assault and recently wrote on social media that she received a voicemail in August from the state’s Victim Information and Notification Service telling her of his impending release. “I have been slowly processing the reality of it all,” she wrote. The Oregonian, citing prison officials, reported that Gillmore was transferred in August from Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla to the minimum-security Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland to help him prepare for his reentry into the community. He will be 63 at the time of his release in December. KOIN reports Gillmore will remain under supervision until 2034.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An Italian heritage group has vowed to appeal a judge’s ruling that officials can remove a 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park. Attorneys for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America have argued that the mayor doesn’t have the power to override an ordinance passed by the City Council in 1955 that cleared the installation of the 800-pound statue of the explorer. Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr. ruled about a week ago that because the statue erected in 1958 is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech – citing a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a Utah city rejecting a monument proposed for a city park by a religious group. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed the lawsuit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue. Then-Mayor Bill Peduto then also recommended its removal. McVay had for two years urged the two sides to work toward a solution, including its relocation to a different location. The statue has been vandalized numerous times and is wrapped in plastic. “Based on the court’s ruling, the mayor can put up or take down any statue he wants on any city-owned property without regard for other branches of the city government,” the Italian Sons and Daughters of America argued. “Obviously, this cannot be correct.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Festival of Children’s Books and Authors returns to an in-person format this year for the first time since 2019, kicking off Friday with a virtual appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor at Lincoln School. Sotomayor, who has written several children’s books in addition to a 2013 memoir, will speak to and answer questions from Rhode Island children. Free signed copies of her books “Just Ask” and “Just Help” will be given to children who attend the 4:30 p.m. event. The festival will continue Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lincoln School, where participants can listen to 30-minute talks by authors, purchase books and have them signed; make book crafts; and buy lunch from a variety of vendors. Authors and illustrators at the event will be Mary Jane Begin, Gaia Cornwall, Anika Aldamuy Denise, Christopher Denise, Rita Hubbard, Kekla Magoon, Juana Martinez-Neal, Oge Mora, Hayley Rocco, John Rocco, Bob Shea, Melissa Stewart, Chris Van Allsburg and Rhode Island’s poet laureate, Tina Cane, as well as members of Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Admission to the two-hour kickoff event with Sotomayor is free, but space is limited, and advance registration is recommended online. Admission to Saturday’s festival is $5.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Write-in U.S. House candidate Lee Turner rallied in downtown Greenville on Saturday to spread the word about her campaign. Turner had no intention of running for Congress, she said, but after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, details of incumbent U.S. Rep. William Timmons’ personal life went viral online, and Democratic candidate Ken Hill dropped out of the race, Turner said: “I’ve got to do something.” Turner said she’s running a campaign based on finding solutions, common ground and bringing elected officials from across the aisle together. “I became more sure that this district needed someone like me, who was a problem solver, versus somebody like Mr. Timmons, who’s just going to tow the party line,” Turner said. While she has run for office as a Democrat in the past, Turner said she is truly an independent who believes people are more alike than they are different and hopes to create legislation with mutual benefits across political ideologies to help the masses. “Mutual benefit is the strongest glue ever,” she said. “It needs no legislation to even sustain itself, but if you do legislate it, it’s not likely to be overturned by the next party in power because it’s mutually beneficial.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A new free online tutoring program is available for K-12 students in the state, administered by the Board of Regents and funded by the Department of Education. The Dakota Dreams Online Tutoring Program is staffed by college students at Black Hills State University and Northern State University who are preparing to become teachers. The program uses a secure online platform for students and tutors to connect for virtual sessions in English, language arts, math, science and social studies. Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson said the program will allow K-12 students to receive individualized support after the school day has ended. “Once a parent has registered their child, students can access a tutor from home, the local library or after-school program, or even their favorite coffee shop,” Sanderson said. “I think parents are going to like this one-on-one support as much as their students.” To access the free service, parents first need to register their students to use the platform. Once registered, sessions can either be scheduled in advance or on-demand, depending on tutor availability. Tutors will be available Monday through Sunday afternoons and evenings. The service will not be available on holidays and during Christmas and spring breaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country music icon Loretta Lynn was buried in her family’s cemetery on her Hurricane Mills estate Friday morning. The private ceremony of about 100 guests took place in the unincorporated Humphreys County town she bought in the 1960s after achieving worldwide fame with “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn died Oct. 4 at the age of 90. She left instructions for her funeral ceremonies, including plans for a large memorial where fans will be invited. “A public memorial is being planned,” family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said. “The family did have a private ceremony Friday with no other details available to share at this time.” McFarland said details about the public ceremony will be released soon. Loretta Lynn’s Ranch is one of the largest campgrounds in the state and draws streams of tourists throughout the year to the rural expanse, where she built an event center and other attractions. Lynn, who owned roughly 3,500 acres in Humphreys County, lived in the estate’s mansion until 1988 before turning it into a tourist center and moving into a smaller house on the property. She also built a museum and replica of the Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, cabin where she grew up for tourists to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The city’s school district suspended its entire police force Friday amid fresh outrage over the hesitant law enforcement response to the gunman who massacred 21 people at Robb Elementary School. The extraordinary move follows the revelation that the district hired a former state trooper who was among hundreds of officers who rushed to the scene of the May 24 shooting. School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Remaining officers will be reassigned to other jobs in the district. Uvalde school leaders’ suspension of campus police operations one month into a new school year in the South Texas community underscores the sustained pressure that families of some of the 19 children and two teachers killed have kept on the district. Brett Cross, the uncle of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, had been protesting outside the school administration building for two weeks, demanding accountability over officers allowing a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. Families have said students in the district are not safe so long as officers who waited so long to confront and kill the gunman remain on the job.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A jury found two animal rights activists not guilty on charges of burglary and theft after they allegedly took two sick piglets from an industrial pig farm. Activists Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, with the California-based group Direct Action Everywhere, had argued during their trial that nothing of value was stolen because the 3-week old piglets were in poor condition and likely to die. The not guilty verdict was delivered Saturday following a weeklong trial. The group took a 360-degree virtual reality video of the March 2017 incident at Smithfield Food’s Circle Four Farms near Milford and promoted it online, as part of a tactic known as “open rescue” that’s meant to shed light on abusive farming practices. Investigators used the video to identify the defendants and three other activists who were charged and took plea deals rather than go to trial. Hsiung and Picklesimer faced up to 51/ 2 years in jail if they had been convicted, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. In 2017 a federal court struck down a Utah law banning secret filming at farm and livestock sites, claiming the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of free speech.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: Residents of a small community were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government – and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation. Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting last week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but said her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick. Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels. He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China – an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Civil War reenactor pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he planted a pipe bomb at a battlefield in 2017 and threatened to disrupt additional events. A federal indictment against Gerald Leonard Drake, 63, of Winchester, Virginia, was unsealed Thursday. The indictment accuses Drake of planting a pipe bomb at Cedar Creek Battlefield during an annual reenactment in October 2017. The bomb did not detonate but resulted in cancellation of the reenactment after its discovery. The indictment also charges him with writing letters threatening violence at subsequent Cedar Creek reenactments, as well as an annual Remembrance Day Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At a press conference Thursday announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Drake falsely claimed connections to Antifa in his threatening letters not only to hide his actual identity but also to create additional political angst. In reality, according to the indictment, Drake was a Civil War reenactor who regularly participated in events at Cedar Creek until he was expelled from his unit in 2014. The indictment, though, does not explicitly state that bitterness over his expulsion motived his alleged misconduct.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia National Park: Park officials have closed recreational fishing indefinitely because waters have reached historic lows. The National Park Service announced it would halt all recreational fishing starting Thursday on the Ozette, Bogachiel, South Fork Calawah, Sol Duc, North Fork Sol Duc, Dickey, Quillayute, Hoh, South Fork Hoh, Queets, Salmon and Quinault rivers. The Cedar, Goodman, Kalaloch and Mosquito Creeks within Olympic National Park are also closed, The Seattle Times reports. The region for months has seen above-average temperatures and low rainfall. Seattle has had 0.48 inches of rain from July to September, while the average for that period is 3.16 inches, making it the driest such stretch on record. Park officials said they hope the closure will help protect fish, especially those trying to make upstream spawning migrations in the low water levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University fraternity has been cleared of hazing allegations but will be sanctioned separately on other violations, the school said. Pi Kappa Phi and the school agreed to end the fraternity’s interim suspension related to alleged hazing. The chapter will be on deferred suspension through February and lose some privileges through June, the school said Thursday. “In this case, our inquiry found no evidence of hazing, but exposed recruitment and alcohol behaviors which violate our Student Conduct Code,” said Jill Gibson, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The fraternity agreed to participate in education, training and harm reduction programs, WVU said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Dane County judge refused Friday to issue a temporary order that would allow local election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit, its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating that the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing Friday morning, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17. Rise Inc., which encourages students to vote, sued after a Waukesha County judge last month sided with Republicans and said clerks are barred from filling in missing witness information on ballot envelopes. The judge struck down guidance the elections commission put in place six years ago, saying nothing in state law allows clerks to do that. The practice was unchallenged until Donald Trump lost Wisconsin to Joe Biden in 2020. About 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots in that election.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Springs: Yellowstone National Park is postponing the opening of a renovated road at its north entrance as it continues to repair the damage from this summer’s catastrophic flooding, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The park has pushed back the road’s opening date from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, according to the newspaper, as park officials said they need more time to ensure that over 5,000 feet of guardrail are properly installed for traffic safety. “We have set incredibly aggressive time frames for these repairs, and our contractors have worked at lightning speed to get this road safely reopened,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a news release. “It’s essential that we do not cut corners and we ensure the road meets required safety standards prior to opening.” Unprecedented flooding in June severely damaged roads, swept away homes and forced the park to close as it evacuated about 10,000 visitors. The National Park Service said the most significant damage occurred at the Yellowstone’s north and northeast entrances, where access was cut off. The flooding washed out segments of the roadway between the north entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs. To reconnect the two areas, authorities have paved and expanded an old stagecoach route from the 1880s called Old Gardiner Road.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/us/power-outage-moore-county-investigation-monday/index.html", "title": "Moore County: Tens of thousands still in the dark after 'targeted ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith no suspects or motive announced, the FBI is joining the investigation into power outages in a North Carolina county believed to have been caused by “intentional” and “targeted” attacks on substations that left around 40,000 customers in the dark Saturday night, prompting a curfew and emergency declaration.\n\nThe mass outage in Moore County turned into a criminal investigation when responding utility crews found signs of potential vandalism of equipment at different sites – including two substations that had been damaged by gunfire, according to the Moore County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n“The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said during a Sunday news conference. “We don’t have a clue why Moore County.”\n\nFields said bullets were fired at the two substations. “It was targeted, it wasn’t random,” he said.\n\nThe sheriff would not say whether the criminal activity was domestic terrorism but noted “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it.”\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper called the incidents a “criminal attack.” The Democrat said the state will make sure critical services have support.\n\nCooper told CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” it is important to find the perpetrators but also to think about preventative measures.\n\n“We need to look forward, to look at how we can harden our electrical grid and make sure that our power sources are protected,” he said, adding the grid “can’t be this vulnerable that someone with knowledge of how to disable the electrical system could come in and actually do that in a very short amount of time.”\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, about 38,000 homes and businesses remain without power, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. He said it could take until Thursday to restore power to everyone affected.\n\nAuthorities announced a county-wide mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., starting Sunday night, with Fields saying the decision was made to protect residents and businesses.\n\nThe North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation also has joined the investigation, officials said.\n\nWork continues Monday at one of the damaged power substations in central North Carolina.

He also has to drive 50 to 70 miles every night to pick up fuel to keep the generators running in his business, he explained.\n\n“We’re seeing about 20 to 30 people an hour. People have been coming in, grabbing some coffee, food and charging their phones,” Bateman said. “Multiple people have also told me how they’ve had to go to other counties for food.”\n\nAll schools in the county are closed Monday and Tuesday. Authorities have opened a shelter running on a generator.\n\nMapbox\n\nOvernight temperatures should be in the 40s\n\nTraffic lights are also out, and while a few stores with generators were able to open their doors, several businesses and churches in Moore County were closed Sunday, CNN affiliate WRAL reported.\n\n“We were just getting over Covid. And now this,” the sheriff said, adding, “It’s gonna hurt all of our restaurants and businesses.”\n\nInside people’s homes, it’s become difficult to keep the cold out.\n\n“We have a 6-month-old baby in the house.

John Nagy/The Pilot/AP\n\n“Equipment will have to be replaced,” Brooks said. “We’re pursuing multiple paths of restoration so that we can restore as many customers as quickly as possible. Recognizing that, we are looking at pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment.”\n\nIn addition to the gunfire damage at the substations, a gate at one of the locations appears to have been taken off its hinges, Asst. Chief Mike Cameron of the Southern Pines Fire and Rescue Department told CNN.\n\nWhile it’s unclear what motivated the alleged vandalism, the sheriff on Sunday addressed rumors circulating on social media that the attack was an attempt to thwart a local drag show.\n\nFields said investigators “have not been able to tie anything back to the drag show,” which was scheduled in the town of Southern Pines at 7 p.m. Saturday, around the time the power went out.\n\nDuke Energy workers gather Sunday as they plan how to repair an electrical substation in Carthage, North Carolina. Jonathan Drake/Reuters\n\nThe head of the LGBTQ+ group that helped organize the drag show said Monday she was unaware of any threats to the event before the attacks. Lauren Mathers, the executive director of Sandhills PRIDE, told CNN they received a lot of “hateful comments” on social media, but nothing that could be considered a threat.\n\nThe house lights were down between numbers when the power went out, so they didn’t realize anything was wrong when the lights didn’t come back on, she said.\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the fact that the shooting was “targeted enough to bring down two different facilities” probably has investigators looking at an “insider threat.”\n\n“They will be looking at the potential that there was either casing or someone who knew the area, knew the facilities and knew exactly where to shoot,” she said on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “These aren’t drive-by incidents.

When the Delmarva Emergency Task Force gathers to train for hurricane readiness, it is the Chesapeake Bay tracking that raises significant concerns in terms of wind, storm surge and flooding, and also evacuation.\n\nA major worry is that these storms impact an area much wider than the coast, causing significant inland flooding and wind damage.\n\nGary Laing, spokesman for the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, said the newest Hurricane Center storm track is one of several that are out there. The storm is so far away, he said, that it is difficult to pinpoint the storm track with any accuracy.\n\nLaing pointed back to Hurricane Sandy, which was expected to make landfall in Delaware before a shift in the track sent it just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n“Even within hours of the storm, it can shift,” he said.\n\nNo matter the track of Joaquin, the National Weather Service is forecasting significant rain for Delaware, some 4-to-10 inches on top of what has already fallen.\n\nIn addition, strong winds with gusts of 20 to 30 miles-per-hour inland, and 45 miles-per-hour along the coast are expected to start Thursday. The region could be hit with weather akin to a nor’easter before the hurricane tracks north.\n\n“People should really be paying attention,” said Chip Guy, a spokesman for Sussex County. “This is the kind of scenario emergency planners have trained for.”\n\nGuy said that it’s important to keep an eye on the forecast because in the days ahead, flooding could be an issue in low-lying areas even if residents don’t live along the coast.\n\nThe National Weather Service is forecasting inland and coastal flooding. As the storm gets closer, hurricane force winds may be felt along the coast, according to the weather service assessment.\n\nThe prospect of a rain-drenched weekend is already prompting cancellation of some events. But two popular ones: the University of Delaware’s Coast Day on Sunday, and the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber’s annual sidewalk sale are set to go on despite the forecast, at least for now.\n\nThe exact timing of the rain is uncertain. But one-half to three-quarters of an inch are in the forecast for Thursday with another 1-to-2 inches of rain predicted for Friday during the day. Another inch of rain could fall Friday night.\n\nMuch of Delaware has already seen close to two inches over 24 hours from Tuesday into Wednesday, according to the University of Delaware Delaware Environmental Observing System.\n\nAnd that’s before the effects of Hurricane Joaquin reach our area over the weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center’s latest projection shows the storm intensifying into a major hurricane by Friday. The latest hurricane center model shows a track that makes landfall off the Outer Banks of North Carolina by 2 p.m. Sunday. The storm is then projected to move north west up Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThe culprit from Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s rainfall is a different weather system, a cold front that is expected to stall off the coast just to our south.\n\nThe cold front is just one factor in trying to forecast and plan for Joaquin. There are two other weather systems in the mix said state Climatologist Daniel J. Leathers. There are also potential impacts from high pressure to the north in Canada and low pressure in the southeast, he said. All these weather systems could drive the path of Joaquin over the next several days, he said.\n\nNormally, the hurricane models start to come together with a clear picture of where a hurricane is headed three to four days out, he said. That isn’t the case this time.\n\nMore rain – sometimes heavy – is likely over the next several days. No flood warnings have been issued for Delaware but the weather service has issued one for the area just south of Delmar including Salisbury, Maryland.\n\nLeathers said the heavy rains, beyond the current accumulations, will come from moisture that builds as Joaquin makes its way north from the tropics.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center upgraded Joaquin from a tropical storm to a hurricane early Wednesday morning as winds increased to 75 mph. Maximum sustained winds were 85 miles-per-hour Wednesday with higher gusts. The storm is moving southwest at 8 mph and is about 245 miles east northeast of the Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nCarol Everhart, chief executive officer of the Rehoboth chamber, said it’s just too hard to reschedule an event like the sidewalk sale.\n\nMany merchants move the sale indoors and typically, over the course of the three days, there’s one day where there is a break in the weather.\n\nWith this forecast, however, Everhart said she isn’t sure that will be the case.\n\n“It’s going to take a toll,” on attendance, she said. But “we’ve never rescheduled it.”\n\nThe University of Delaware College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, Coast Day – set for Sunday – is typically a rain or shine event, too. But in an advisory posted on the Coast Day website said: “we are keeping a close eye on the weather for the weekend ... Should we need to cancel Coast Day for the safety of our visitors, an announcement will be made no later than 10 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 2 and will be posted to the Coast Day website.\n\nThe Georgetown Chamber of Commerce canceled Saturday’s Wings & Wheels event, said Karen Duffield, executive director of the Georgetown Chamber. They will move ahead with the Aviation Day Expo and Dinner and Show on Friday, she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2020/08/04/isaias-track-forecast-radar-and-impact-delaware-maryland-virginia-new-jersey/5579773002/", "title": "Isaias track, forecast, radar and impact on Delaware, Maryland ...", "text": "What was once Hurricane Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall late Monday night in North Carolina. But the storm still spawned tornadoes and dumped heavy rain as it moved up the East Coast through the mid-Atlantic region Tuesday.\n\nFlooding proved to be the biggest risk for much of Delmarva, a result of heavy rain and higher-than-normal tides. Heavy wind also caused significant damage, knocking over trees and power lines.\n\nLocal impacts from the storm are expected to subside by Wednesday morning as the storm moves much farther north and offshore. Isaias will likely start to weaken by Tuesday night, and is expected become a post-tropical system by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.\n\nTropical Storm Isaias: What impacts are hitting Delaware Tuesday morning\n\nDelaware and hurricanes: What Tropical Storm Isaias reminds us about coastal risk\n\nState of emergency\n\n7:07 p.m.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney declared and signed a state of emergency order Tuesday.\n\nThe state of emergency allows the Delaware Emergency Management Agency to direct and coordinate the resources to assist with response in the areas affected by the storm.\n\nIt also directs the Delaware Department of Transportation and the Delaware State Police, in consultation with DEMA and the Secretary of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, to close bridges and roads as necessary to protect the health and safety of Delawareans and travelers.\n\n“Several communities in Delaware experienced significant damage from Tropical Storm Isaias,” Carney said in a statement. “We are declaring a State of Emergency to provide coordinated assistance for response and recovery efforts from this storm damage. Severe weather can happen quickly. I urge all Delawareans to stay safe, and prepare for any future weather events by visiting preparede.org.”\n\nThe emergency order was effective as of 3 p.m. Tuesday and lasts \"until further notice.\"\n\nHundreds evacuated from Newark motel\n\n5:22 p.m.\n\nAbout 200 people were evacuated from a Newark motel after water from the Christina River flooded the parking lot and first floor rooms, the city's police department said.\n\nNewark Police officers responded to the Rodeway Inn at 1120 South College Avenue in Newark, where at around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday water was about to \"overtake\" the first floor rooms, police said.\n\nOfficers worked with Aetna Hose Hook and Ladder Company of Newark to get people to safety.\n\nAbout 25 of people were transported to a shelter set up by the American Red Cross at Glasgow High School in coordination with the New Castle County Office of Emergency Management. No injuries were reported and no watercraft were necessary for the evacuation, police said.\n\nThe motel has been temporarily closed.\n\nWoman's death believed to be storm-related\n\n5:07 p.m.\n\nA woman in Milford was killed Tuesday morning when she was struck by a falling tree branch, Delaware State Police said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe woman was outside assessing damage from the storm on North Shore Drive when the branch fell from a damaged tree, police said.\n\nPolice responded to the scene around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday \"in reference to a deceased adult female.\"\n\nPolice said the victim, who they did not name, will be turned over to the Delaware Division of Forensic Science for an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death.\n\nBeaches largely spared\n\n4:11 p.m.\n\nWhile Isaias whipped inland areas with damaging winds, tornadoes and flash flooding, the storm largely spared the beaches along the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay that drive Delaware's tourism economy.\n\nThe storm's more inland track, combined with its rapid forward speed, meant the coast really wasn't hit hard enough or long enough to cause any worrisome erosion issues, said Michael Powell, head of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control's shoreline and waterway management section.\n\n\"But, it’s the first week of August,\" he said. \"We still have two full months of heightened tropical storm activity to make it through. But we made it through this one.\"\n\n[Story continues below the photo gallery.]\n\nAll the beaches Powell visited on Tuesday from Pickering Beach down south along the ocean coast appeared to sustain little damage from rough surf, and he observed no significant damage to the dunes. A few beaches along the Delaware Bay in Kent County were inaccessible due to downed trees blocking roadways, he said.\n\n\"The impacts from Tropical Storm Isaias will be unnoticeable by next weekend,\" he said.\n\nMultiple evacuations in North East, Maryland\n\n4:05 p.m.\n\nThe town of North East, Maryland in Cecil County, just west of Elkton, had widespread water damage and emergency crews were evacuating some residents from their homes.\n\nFlooding in the town – located on the north end of the North East River – had many closed roads, vehicles under water and more than 1,000 people without power.\n\nNewark asks residents to minimize water use\n\n3:39 p.m.\n\nNewark on Tuesday afternoon asked residents to minimize water use because the city's sanitary sewer system capacity has been reduced.\n\nThe system lost capacity due to the \"large volume of water\" associated with the storm.\n\n\"Minimize the use of water until flooding has receded to avoid potential sanitary sewer backups,\" a notification from the reads.\n\nNational Weather Service reports tornado sightings in Delaware\n\n3:32 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service has reported four tornado sightings in Delaware, including three in Kent County and one in New Castle County.\n\nThe tornadoes were spotted on Sandtown Road near Felton, along Route 13 in Smyrna, in the area of Route 8 and Bennington Street in Dover and on Gum Bush Road in Townsend.\n\nA wind sensor in Smyrna recorded a gust of 96 mph at 9:09 a.m., according to the weather service.\n\n\"It sounded like a freight train,\" said Smyrna resident John Marvel. \"I got everyone into the basement.\"\n\nWhile a tree fell near his home in the Green Meadows neighborhood just east of Route 13 on East Commerce Street, his family is OK, and damage was limited to a bent gutter and a few lost shingles.\n\n\"I've lived here about 15 years and I've never seen anything as bad as this,\" Marvel said.\n\nLane closures on I-95, some roads reopen\n\n2:49 p.m.\n\nThree right lanes of I-95 south are closed just after the Route 202 south on-ramp as a result of storm damage to the road, according to the state's department of transportation. Delays should be expected, and southbound traffic should use I-495 south to avoid delays, the agency said.\n\nSeveral roads that experienced closures or delays Tuesday morning have fully or partially reopened, including Route 1 and I-495. Speed limits may be reduced in some areas.\n\nDover police updates residents on power outages\n\n2:42 p.m.\n\nMany neighborhoods in Dover are still without power, including businesses and traffic lights, said Sgt. Mark Hoffman, public information officer for the Dover Police Department.\n\nAs the city’s electric department is working to restore multiple outages, Hoffman asked residents to be patient since more minor issues will likely be delayed.\n\n\"All our resources throughout the city are spread thin right now,\" he said.\n\nThere have been no reports of injuries or fatalities due to the storm, he said. Most of the damage has affected utilities, power lines and trees with some damage to homes and businesses.\n\nDover’s Mayor Robin Christiansen declared a state of emergency around 11 a.m., encouraging people to stay off the roads. Hoffman advised anyone who drives in the area to be cautious of the dark traffic lights and first responders responding to damage on the roads.\n\nOutages started around 9 a.m., and the Dover Police Department is still running on a generator.\n\nNational Weather Service updates forecast\n\n2:23 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain leading to flash flooding is expected to continue across much of the mid-Atlantic region this afternoon before tapering off in the early evening, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center's 2 p.m. advisory, Tropical Storm Isaias is racing northeastward across eastern Pennsylvania into southeastern New York at about 40 mph.\n\n\"On the forecast track, the center of Isaias will continue to move near or along the coast of the mid-Atlantic states today, and move across the northeastern United States into southern Canada tonight,\" the advisory reads.\n\nSignificant swells and rip current risk will continue along the coast through at least Wednesday with tropical storm force winds continuing into the afternoon before gradually ending, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSoutheast Pennsylvania and northwest New Jersey will experience strong wind into the evening. The Delaware Bay, northeastern Chesapeake Bay, Delaware River and the coasts of New Jersey and Delaware are at risk of minor to moderate storm surge inundation.\n\nIsolated tornadoes are possible along the I-95 corridor into Delaware and New Jersey the rest of the day, the National Weather Service said.\n\nEmergency personnel rescue multiple people from flood waters at Hockessin shopping center\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nThree people were transported to Christiana Hospital after a water rescue saved them from high water at the Lantana Square shopping center in Hockessin Tuesday afternoon.\n\nEmergency personnel were seen in inflatable rescue boats, paddling through Lantana Square's flooded parking lot. Crews were also operating in a stream adjacent to the center.\n\nNew Castle County Paramedics said they assisted Hockessin Fire Co. after an occupied vehicle became lodged in a drainage basin, trapping the driver inside. Bystanders who came to the occupant's aide also became trapped in the swift water.\n\nTraffic released on Chesapeake Bay Bridge\n\n12:55 p.m.\n\nAll traffic on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge has been released, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority. Traffic approaching the bridge had been held in both directions starting around 9:45 a.m. Before then, access to the bridge was restricted to certain vehicle types.\n\nHogan: 'Heed all warnings, avoid travel if possible, and use common sense'\n\n12:32 p.m.\n\nThere are numerous road and bridge closures impacting multiple jurisdictions in Maryland. More than 60,000 power outages have been reported statewide, according a press release from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office.\n\n\"At my direction, the state has activated all available resources to respond, and our team will continue to monitor the storm’s path,\" Hogan said. \"We urge Marylanders to heed all warnings, avoid travel if possible, and use common sense.\"\n\nAs of 11:25 a.m., Maryland's transportation department was responding to 55 incidents, with the largest number, 14, in St. Mary's County.\n\nThe storm is expected to continue to impact Maryland through Tuesday evening. Additional flooding, 3-6 inches of heavy rain, tidal surge and wind damage from tropical storm force winds are anticipated.\n\nThe press release provided a damage report as of noon broken down by county. In Wicomico County, tornadic activity was reported in the area of Mardela Springs. In Worcester County, a tornado was confirmed near Girdletree.\n\nSeveral northern Delaware roads closed, power outage causes traffic signals to go dark\n\n12:09 p.m.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Transportation has closed several roads in Delaware as heavy rain produces flash flooding, and down trees and power lines block traffic.\n\nThe Interstate 495 ramps at 12th Street are closed due to flooding.\n\nThe right north lane of I-495 just before Holly Oak is closed due to high water.\n\nGovernor Printz Boulevard is closed near East Lea Boulevard because cars are stuck in water in the road.\n\nRoute 72 under I-95 in Newark is closed due to flooding.\n\nPaper Mill Road at White Clay Creek is closed due to flooding.\n\nCasho Mill Road at the CSX railroad underpass is closed due to flooding.\n\nLocal roads in Newark are closed due to flooding, including Barksdale and Nottingham Roads and Timberline and Rahway Drives.\n\nMarl Pit Road in Middletown is closed due to multiple down trees.\n\nCedar Lane Road in Middletown is closed due to multiple down trees.\n\nRoute 896 by Summit Airport is closed due to power line poles down across the north lanes.\n\nAll south lanes of Route 1 are closed near Harris Road between Townsend and Odessa.\n\nAll south lanes of Route 1 are closed at Route 299 in Middletown.\n\nAcross New Castle County, power outages have caused \"numerous\" traffic signals to go dark, DelDOT said. In Sussex County, 167 traffic signals were without power as of about 11:30 a.m., according to DelDOT.\n\nAt least two cars were almost completely submerged and several others were also stuck in water on Governor Printz Boulevard in Edgemoor.\n\nOne man, who had driven to the Food Lion on Governor Printz to go grocery shopping Tuesday morning, said he’s seen water pool on the road before, but nothing like this.\n\n\"I’ve seen spots where areas get flooded, but I haven’t seen cars get stuck in it,\" he said. \"People were stopping and some were like 'oh shit' and turned back around, but some tried to make it though and couldn’t.\"\n\nPointing to one car that was almost completely submerged, the man said he saw the driver try to drive through the water before giving up.\n\n\"I guess when they tried to get through, the car just shut off,\" he said. \"The water is just getting higher and higher.\"\n\nTropical Storm Isaias damages homes, cars throughout Delaware\n\n11:51 a.m.\n\nTropical Storm Isaias has destroyed roofs, mangled siding, crushed cars and knocked out power for close to 100,000 households in Delaware and Maryland.\n\nDelaware residents started assessing damage from Isaias in the late morning as the storm's strong winds and heavy rain continued moving north. A number of homes throughout the state were dealt permanent damage by strong wind gusts or fallen trees.\n\nIn Bear's Brennan Estates, Isaias stripped several homes of their siding. The storm completely destroyed the back wall of at least one home, and caused another's roof to collapse.\n\nIn Millsboro, an American sycamore snapped in half and fell through Cathy Powell's roof as she was watching the news report tornado warnings around 8:30 a.m. The tree's leaves covered her house, located on Possum Point Road.

In nearby neighborhoods, residents strolled out late Tuesday mornign to find down trees lining most streets.\n\nResidents on Sunset Lane in Lewes said the storm seemed to have passed when suddenly strong winds started blowing in off the nearby water, uprooting at least five trees in the small neighborhood. One of those trees fell on Jacqi Detweiler’s car.\n\n\"I heard a bunch of loud banging, the power went out and then I looked out and saw the tree fall,\" Detweiler said.\n\nShe yelled from her porch before taking cover back inside the house. A few doors down, another fallen tree narrowly missed the home where Deborah Bodine lives.\n\n\"This is the first time I’ve ever dealt with something like this,\" she said. “It was just chaos.\"\n\nPower outages in Delaware and Maryland\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nThousands of Delaware and Maryland residents are without power Tuesday morning, as Tropical Storm Isaias brings heavy rain, strong winds and a few tornadoes to the Delmarva region.\n\nDelmarva Power's online outage map shows 756 current outages in Delaware and Maryland, impacting 63,848 customers.

Their damage costs the state $290 million in agricultural losses annually, according to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nThousands of non-native species have been brought to the state over the years either intentionally or by accident.\n\n\"Many of these species are benign while others, such as agricultural crops, are highly beneficial,\" the DEP stated on its website. \"However, a small percentage have caused severe damage to our environment and to our health.\"\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nHere are five invasive species that have caused the most damage to the Garden State over the years:\n\nSpotted lanternfly\n\nThe spotted lanternfly, a colorful, Asian plant hopper, made its way to New Jersey in 2018 from Pennsylvania. It is known to feed on the bark, leaves and sap of more than 70 plant and tree species, including willows, maples, poplars, tulip poplars, birch and ash. Eight counties are currently under quarantine due to the lanternfly: Warren, Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem.\n\n\"We currently have 13 crews of two who are out searching for and scraping egg masses and will be treating areas when the spotted lanternflies begin hatching in early May,\" a New Jersey Department of Agriculture spokesperson said in a statement sent to NorthJersey.com. \"We are enlisting the help of the state’s citizens to helps us eliminate this insect as much as possible, now through egg mass scrapings and later through treatments on their properties.\"\n\nThe lanternfly's feeding stresses plants and hurts their ability to heal and can kill the trees.\n\nThe bug was first discovered in the U.S. in 2014. It has since spread to New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut and Ohio. The NJDA is researching natural predators for the lanternfly to control its population.\n\nEmerald ash borer\n\nThis beetle has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees throughout the U.S. and Canada. It was first seen in New Jersey in Somerset County in May 2014. It has made its way to Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex and Warren counties since then.\n\nThe ash borer once caused Morris County to chop down 10,000 ash trees as a safety precaution. It's believed to have first come to New Jersey on wooden packing materials from China.\n\nNine percent of New Jersey's forested areas, mostly in the northwestern part of the state, were threatened by the emerald ash borer.\n\n\"The department has been releasing egg and larval biocontrol parasitoids against this insect in ash stands throughout the state since 2016 to help curb the spread of the emerald ash borer,\" the NJDA stated.\n\nEnvironment:NJ's unequal rules put some at greater risk of drinking lead. These families pay the price\n\nKhapra beetle\n\nThese beetles are native to India. They stow away in grain and seed.\n\n\"Previous U.S. detections of this tiny beetle have required massive, long-term and costly control and eradication efforts,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated.\n\nThey do better in hot weather but are survivors, resistant to many pesticides and able to go a long time without food.\n\nThe khapra spoils much of stored grain and seed products where its found from its feeding, per the USDA.\n\nLonghorned tick\n\nThe first longhorned tick was found in New Jersey in 2017 but could have been in the state longer.\n\nNative to China, Korea and Japan, longhorned ticks are tiny and can infest a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to livestock and wildlife. It is unknown how much of a threat it is to humans. One was found on a Bergen County girl in 2018.\n\nThe tick has been confirmed to be in Bergen, Camden, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, and Union counties in New Jersey. This tick is unique because it is asexual and does not need a mate to reproduce.\n\nGypsy moth\n\nThe gypsy moth is one of the oldest invaders, released into the United States in Massachusetts in 1868. It made its way to New Jersey a half-century later and has been feeding on tree leaves since. More than a million acres of trees have been damaged by gypsy moths since 2007, prompting the state to spray insecticides from planes on wide swaths of forest.\n\nNew Jersey started a suppression program for the moth in the 1970s. The NJDA recommended 170 acres in the state for gypsy moth treatment in 2021, down from 4,500 acres in 2018 and more than 100,000 in 2008.\n\nGypsy moths threaten oak, maple, birch, beech, willow, and hickory trees. The larger caterpillars also have been known to feed on pine, spruce, hemlock, and many common ornamentals, per the NJDA.\n\nJoshua Jongsma is a breaking news editor for NorthJersey.com.

It had an estimated maximum wind speed of 120 miles per hour and its path may have been up to 400 yards wide at one point.\n\nThe funnel traveled 6.2 miles from Woodland Ferry Road northeast to Pepper Road, destroying a barn and uprooting trees, the National Weather Service said. A tree also fell on a house, leaving one man with minor injuries.\n\nHe was taken to Nanticoke Memorial Hospital in Seaford, officials said.\n\nMore:Laurel schools to remain closed after tornado\n\nMore than 1,000 still without power after tornado hits Laurel; 9 buildings condemned\n\nOn Seaford Road near Laurel, the blue childhood home of Scott Phillips seemingly marked the starting point of some of the worst damage.\n\nPhillips, who lives in the house with his 91-year-old father, said he heard a large boom in the middle of the night, likely from a maple crashing into the roof above his bedroom.\n\nIn the front yard, only one of two pin oak trees that his parents planted around their wedding day in 1946 survived. The other fell toward the road, not the house, revealing a more than 6-foot-wide root system that cracked the asphalt of his driveway and uprooted chunks of his lawn.\n\n“It’s like it started right here,” said Phillips’ brother Kevin Phillips.\n\nScott Phillips said the storm left a 1- or 2-foot wide hole in the roof over the attic.\n\nDown the road, debris and tree limbs were scattered along the roadside. A mangled irrigation system could be seen off in a field, providing the backdrop for emergency and utility crews trying to restore power.\n\nThe Phillips brothers and their neighbor Mike Smith said they lost power during the storm and do not expect it to be restored until Tuesday. Downed power lines were slung on the side of the road hours after the storm had cleared.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses along the nearby highway that escaped damage struggled with a lack of connection for their credit card machines.\n\nRumors of a tornado confirmed\n\nThe Laurel Volunteer Fire Department headed recovery efforts after the tornado, with the fire station acting as a staging ground for various state and county agencies.\n\nThe full extent of the damage has not yet been determined, the fire department said. The American Red Cross was on site providing assistance to residents.\n\nAlarms started going off about 3:45 a.m., said assistant fire chief Mike Lowe, whose dog started crying and woke him up.\n\nLowe said he had never seen a storm like it. He is a lifelong resident and has worked for the fire department for more than 30 years. Other residents said the same thing.\n\nThe Laurel School District closed for the day, while Sussex Technical High School in Georgetown shut down at 11 a.m. due to electrical issues from the accompanying line of thunderstorms.\n\nChip Guy, the public information officer for Sussex County, said at least a dozen, and possibly as many as two dozen, buildings were structurally damaged. That number is extremely fluid.\n\n\"This is more than just a couple pieces of siding,\" Guy said. \"In some cases, parts of roofs have been sheared off.\"\n\nJoe Thomas, director of the Sussex County Emergency Operations Center, estimated at least 20 residents had been impacted on some level.\n\nHe said Sussex County residents should call 302-856-7366 to report storm damage. The amount reported could affect potential state and federal funding for the area's recovery.\n\nU.S. 13 was closed for part of the day. About a dozen other side streets remained closed or partially Monday afternoon.\n\nIn Kent County, things were less severe, and there were no injuries reported.\n\nChief Colin T. Faulkner with Kent County Emergency Management said two houses were hit by trees or tree limbs: one on Whispering Oak Drive in the Milford area and on one Marion Drive in Dover.\n\nThere were no 911 calls related to the power outages.\n\n“You would think we were in bad shape the way this storm sounded when it came through last night,\" he said. \"I think all the counties had wires down, which is not uncommon when you have wind.”\n\n“I think we escaped pretty good.\"\n\nA.J. Schall, director of the Delaware Emergency Mangement Agency, was in Laurel Monday morning helping assess the damage. Ironically, he said, this is Severe Weather Awareness and Preparedness Week in Delaware.\n\nDuring the event, residents are encouraged to make family emergency plans, sign up for emergency alerts and put together emergency supply kits.\n\nFind out more at PrepareDE.org.\n\nTornados not uncommon\n\nSevere thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued for Delaware by the National Weather Service early Monday morning.\n\n\"There was a line of thunderstorms that pretty much caught the Appalachians overnight and crossed into the state of Delaware, roughly between 2 and 5 in the morning,\" said Jason Franklin with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey.\n\nHe said there was heavy rain and isolated rotating winds.\n\nOn Facebook, some said they saw the tornado. They posted pictures and shared stories, even as the National Weather Service worked to confirm its existence.\n\nDelmarvaWX, a Facebook page run by Hunter Clifton Outten, who identifies himself as a meteorological scientist and storm chaser, was posting updates during the storm. He is self-taught and does not have a degree in meteorology, according to a recent blog post.\n\nState Climatologist Daniel Leathers said Delaware sees about one tornado each year. Since 1954, there have been 63.\n\nOne of the most destructive was June 7, 1988. Thirty people were injured in a tornado that started in Middletown and had a path of 23 miles.\n\n“It’s really not unusual at all this time of year,” he said, pointing to the clash of cold air from Canada and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean as the culprit for tornado-producing thunderstorms overnight.\n\nThat atmospheric clash is also what causes most of the area’s tumultuous, stormy weather this time of year.\n\n“Most of our tornadoes have a small path … and don’t stay on the ground very long,” he said. “But if there’s a chance for severe weather, people should take a look and take it seriously.”\n\nSEVERE WEATHER IN U.S.\n\nDeath toll rises to 8 as tornadoes cut swath of destruction through South\n\nTornado threat, quarter-size hail, severe thunderstorms possible for central Pa.\n\nNJ weather: Severe storms coming, tornadoes possible\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Reading scores declined in both grades, too, since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, average reading scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by three points from 2019, and average math scores in fourth and eighth grades decreased by five and eight points respectively, the test results show. The test, which involved 446,700 students at 10,970 schools, across all states at the beginning of the calendar year, is scored on a scale of 0 to 500.\n\nThe 2022 results also show students the lowest-performing students performed even worse. And of particular concern, more students scored at what are considered \"below basic\" levels.\n\nNAEP scores by state\n\nUSA TODAY analyzed the scores state by state. There are glimmers of hope: Some states held steady in reading, and a few improved slightly. Fourth grade reading scores increased by two points in Alabama and Louisiana, and eighth grade scores increased by two points in Department of Defense schools. The most dismal declines occurred in math, and no state or jurisdiction was left untouched. Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, New Mexico and others saw double-digit score declines in either fourth or eighth grade reading, or both.\n\nThe pandemic wasn't easy on kids, their families, teachers or school leaders. The in-person rhythm of nearly every school in the country was upended, with students shifting, sometimes clumsily, to learning on devices, if they had them, at home in March 2020 and beyond. As the rest of the school year went and the next one came, school closures persisted. Remote learning looked different nearly everywhere, Carr said.\n\nFor all the agitation over reopening schools, Carr said students' scores don't directly reflect how long schools were closed to in-person classes during the pandemic. When schools did reopen, many students and teachers missed classes anyway in part because of COVID outbreaks.\n\nIt all added up to nationwide setbacks in learning and potential academic declines across the U.S. that may persist for years to come.\n\n\"What we need to do as researchers, as educators, as analysts is now take a second deeper dive to understand exactly what role it did play, along with all the other factors that were influencing students' lives like mental health and like disruptions in behaviors,\" Carr said, \"to help students' chances of recovery.\"\n\n'Largest score decline':In reading for nation's 9-year-olds, first-ever drop in math\n\nAcross the board, in all states, concerns remain for the most disadvantaged students – including kids with disabilities and English-language learners. The percentage of those kids, among others, who performed at or above the NAEP level considered proficient was smaller compared with 2019, the report shows.\n\nU.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said there must be a nationwide effort to recover and move students forward. And he's calling on school leaders to leverage the funding and resources the Biden administration made available through the American Rescue Plan to address student learning loss.\n\n“Let me be very clear: These results are not acceptable,” Cardona said. “We need to continue to approach the task of catching all of our students up with the urgency that this issue warrants. We must redouble our efforts to accelerate student recovery.\"\n\nHow did fourth graders do?\n\nFourth grade reading scores declined in 30 states and jurisdictions, while fourth-grade math performance declined everywhere. The national average declined by five points in math and three points in reading since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nSome states fared better than others. For fourth grade math, Delaware (-14), the District of Columbia (-12) and Virginia (-11) had the highest scores declines followed by Maryland, New Mexico and New York (-10 for each.) On the flip side, Alabama and Illinois' scores remained stagnant, and Iowa, Wisconsin and fourth grade math scores at Department of Defense schools dropped by one point, the data shows.\n\nMore:As pandemic lingers, students in Virginia school struggle with frustration, distractions\n\nDrops in fourth grade reading scores weren't as dramatic as math overall, but took a major hit in some places. Virginia (-10), Delaware (-9) had the largest score declines followed by the District of Colombia, Idaho, Maine, Oklahoma and West Virginia (-8 each.) At the opposite end of the spectrum, Alabama and Louisiana improved in overall average sores by two points, Hawaii improved in overall average scores by one point, and Arizona, Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Department of Defense school scores remained stagnant.\n\nOn average, fourth grade reading scores were the lowest since 2005, the results show. One quarter of fourth graders, on average, performed below \"basic\" in reading, a national increase of 3 percentage points from 2019, the data shows. The NAEP \"basic\" scoring category is described as \"partial mastery of the knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at a given grade,\" but does not have or define an achievement level description for below \"basic.\"\n\nHow were eighth grade scores?\n\nEighth-grade reading scores declined in 33 states and jurisdictions, and eighth-grade math performance declined nearly everywhere. More than a third of eighth grade kids performed below basic on the math assessment, a national increase of 7 percentage points from 2019, the data shows. The national average test scores declined by eight points in math and three points in reading since the onset of the pandemic.\n\n\"The eighth grade mathematics results are particularly concerning as that this is the place where a pivotal moment is taking place for students in their academic careers,\" Carr said.\n\nOklahoma (-13) Delaware and West Virginia (-12), Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (-11 in each) saw the worst eighth grade math score declines. Scores for Department of Defense schools dropped by just one point in comparison, and Utah (-3), Alabama, Alaska and Idaho (-4 in each) saw the smallest test score declines.\n\nStudents typically can opt to take algebra or geometry courses in middle school to level up in math in high school, but now they're recovering from the lack of more basic skills. In turn, students are losing out on lessons that will prepare them eventually for careers in math, science and technology.\n\n\"We need to be concerned about getting the students back on track so that they can be prepared for global competition in these areas, and national competition in these areas,\" Carr said.\n\nAnd for eighth grade reading, Maine (-8), Delaware, Kansas, Oklahoma, Oregon (-7 in each) and Connecticut, Missouri, North Carolina and West Virginia (-6 in each) saw the largest score declines. Department of Defense schools (+2), Hawaii and Nevada (+1 in each) improved reading scores slightly, and Alaska, California, District of Columbia and New York held steady with identical average scores to 2019.\n\nNAEP scores are here. What's next?\n\nFederal, local and school leaders agree the results show will take extraordinary measures and a bounty of resources to meet the needs of America's school kids. And while some argue it's coming too late, there's no better time than now to solve and invest in every place experiencing declines in learning, Cardona said on Friday.\n\n“In this moment, we must prioritize intentional collaboration and innovation. We can’t be satisfied with business as usual,\" Cardona said. \"We must do better, and we can.”\n\nIn an email to USA TODAY, the Education Department said it plans to hold sessions on reading and math with educators and education leaders to \"reinforce the President's call to use ARP funds to combat learning loss\" starting Wednesday and issue what it calls a learning acceleration guide to districts and states \"re-enforcing the key strategies districts and states should use to address learning loss and academic recovery, with additional resources over the coming weeks.\"\n\nMore:COVID-19 pandemic aid more than $300 billion short for dealing with student learning loss, study shows\n\nEducation advocates who were long awaiting the results demanded the federal government make further investments in student learning and school leaders to invest resources that could help make up for the declines.\n\nThey said the nation’s leaders should look at continued federal and state targeted investments that are \"crucial for students.\" They mentioned supporting student well-being and using learning practices to help students catch up at this critical time. And they suggested looking at data that shows what works, including intensive tutoring, family engagement, equitable schools and healthy relationships with teachers.\n\n\"Now is the time to activate these resources and supports,\" said Denise Forte, interim CEO of Education Trust.\n\nAcademic recovery can't solely be focused on what was considered \"normal\" in academic achievement before the onset of the pandemic, Carr said, noting that inequities persisted for the most disadvantaged students before it, too, and \"laid bare an 'opportunity gap’ that has long existed.\"\n\n\"It also showed how every student was vulnerable to the pandemic’s disruptions,\" she said. \"We do not have a moment to waste.\"\n\nTeachers, we want to hear from you: How is this school year going?\n\nIf you encounter trouble filling out the form below, find it here.\n\nContributing: Ramon Padilla\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

The Alabama Finance Department confirmed that the bond sale, which had been approved last month, was finalized. The deal closure comes after criminal justice reform activists had strived for more than a year to disrupt the sale. But legal wrangling over the project is continuing through ongoing litigation. Gov. Kay Ivey and lawmakers approved the construction as a solution to Alabama’s ongoing prison woes. Critics of the plan argue that the state is ignoring the bigger issues – prison staffing levels and leadership – to focus on building projects. “The construction of new and modern correctional facilities is absolutely and undeniably necessary to support the safety of both inmates and staff, to improve mental health care, to provide space for vocational and rehabilitative programs, and ultimately to protect public safety,” Alabama officials said in a statement. “No eleventh-hour lawsuits by inmates or activists will halt these efforts, and the state intends to move to dismiss the lawsuits and to vigorously defend against the claims as being without merit.” Activists had tried to discourage the deal, calling it a cruel investment in mass incarceration.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some rain helped firefighters battling a wildfire that prompted evacuations. About a half-inch fell into early Monday, allowing crews to build more fire breaks to help control the wildfire started by lightning June 21. “It’s not really like a season-ending type of rain; it’s more like a slowing,” said Mark Enty, a spokesperson for a state firefighting team. The fire has been burning near the community of Anderson. Evacuation orders were place for all properties accessed by roads, trails or driveways on the west side of the Parks Highway from mileposts 269 to 275. The city of Anderson, located about 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks, is not under an evacuation order. At least one home has been confirmed to have been lost, and Enty said Denali Borough officials will make an official assessment of other structures. The fire was estimated to be 110 square miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Evictions in the greater Phoenix area have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The latest data from the Maricopa County Justice Court shows that landlords filed 5,792 evictions in June, compared with 5,669 in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums that slowed lockouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended. June also saw the highest number of monthly eviction filings since the pandemic began in spring 2020. A court spokesman emphasized that applications for rental assistance are still being accepted and encouraged tenants in need to apply.\n\nArkansas\n\nParagould: Jimmie Lou Fisher, who served as Arkansas’ state treasurer for more than two decades and was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, has died, a funeral home said. She was 80. Fisher died Monday at Arkansas Methodist Medical Center in Paragould, Mitchell Funeral Home said. A cause of death was not released. Then-Gov. Bill Clinton appointed Fisher as state auditor in 1979. She later served as treasurer from 1981 to 2002. “I will always remember that early October morning in 1991, when Jimmie Lou introduced me as I kicked off my presidential campaign on the steps of the Old State House,” Clinton said in a statement Tuesday. “As always, she was enthusiastic, caring and kind, saying just the words we all needed to hear.” He added: “She loved Arkansas and Arkansas loved her back. And she did a fine job as state treasurer.” Fisher ran for governor in 2002 and lost to Republican Mike Huckabee, capturing 47% of the vote. “She loved politics and was a faithful and fierce warrior for her party throughout her adult life,” Huckabee said Tuesday. A funeral service is scheduled for Thursday in Paragould.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill, who was ordered to pay attorneys’ fees to a British tabloid and two conservative journalists she sued after the publication of intimate photos without her consent, has filed for bankruptcy protection. If successful, the move could allow Hill to avoid paying about $220,000 in fees to the defendants, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Democrat who briefly represented a district north of Los Angeles had accused multiple parties in a revenge-porn lawsuit of violating the law by publishing or distributing the compromising photos. The lawsuit was thrown out, and a judge later rendered the financial judgments. Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She resigned in 2019 after the publication of the photos and amid a House ethics probe into allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her congressional staffers, which she denied. Hill, 34, gained national attention in 2018 when she was elected to Congress in a district long under Republican control. She was celebrated as the face of millennial change and was close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who allegedly made a threatening phone call against the state’s top elections official has been charged with retaliating against an elected official. Kirk Wertz, 52, was arrested June 6 in suburban Denver over the June 30 phone call to the office of Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold after investigators tracked his cellphone moving from Goodland, Kansas, to Colorado, according to a court document. Authorities have not revealed what the alleged threat was. His alleged statements to the person who answered the phone at Griswold’s office and to a state trooper who called the number back later were redacted from a document explaining why he was arrested. A spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney’s Office, Carolyn Tyler, confirmed that Wertz had been charged but declined to elaborate beyond what was included in the document. Wertz was being held in jail Friday after making his first appearance in court Thursday. There was no attorney listed as representing him yet in court records. In a statement, Griswold thanked law enforcement for taking action against Wertz and said threats would not deter her from carrying out her election duties. “The wave of violent threats directed at election officials and workers across the county is extremely concerning,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The wife of a former state lawmaker pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with her role in the alleged theft of more than $600,000 in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven. Lauren DiMassa, one of several people including her husband who were arrested in the investigation, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Hartford. Sentencing has not been scheduled. She remains free on bail. Federal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa, formerly known as Lauren Knox, nearly $148,000 for services she never provided to the city. She and her husband were accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services including youth violence prevention, but instead they used the money for their own benefit, prosecutors said. DiMassa’s lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that DiMassa turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband. O’Reilly declined to comment after the hearing. DiMassa’s husband is former state Rep. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council. He resigned from both positions after his arrest in October. He has pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the First State saw a slight decline in fatalities in 2020, a report released Tuesday still ranks Delaware among the deadliest states for pedestrians. Smart Growth America’s Dangerous by Design 2022 report analyzed federal crash and fatality data from 2016 to 2020 – the latest statistics publicly available – finding Delaware’s pedestrian fatalities declined slightly during the pandemic, averaging 2.89 deaths per 100,000 people from 2016-20. That represented a 0.42 decline in deaths per 100,000 people from 2016 to 2019, but long-term comparisons between rates from 2011-15 and 2016-20 show little change, keeping Delaware the fifth most dangerous state for pedestrians, the report shows. New Mexico was at the top with 3.76 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 people annually, followed by Florida with 3.22 deaths, South Carolina with 3.19 deaths and Arizona with 2.98 deaths, according to the report. Delaware has consistently ranked among the deadliest states for pedestrian safety, and over the past decade, the number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities on the state’s roadways has nearly doubled. The First State saw non-motorized fatalities increase from 21 in 2009 to 28 in 2020, according to the latest statistics available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. residents can now preregister for monkeypox vaccination appointments, WUSA-TV reports, citing a Tuesday announcement by DC Health. Once appointments become available, starting Thursday, people who preregistered will receive an email invitation to make an appointment. Residents will then have 48 hours to claim their appointment. About 3,000 appointments are expected to become available this week. Currently, eligibility for the vaccination is limited to adults in certain sexual circumstances that would increase their risk, based on where the virus has been circulating most heavily in the U.S. But residents who do not meet the current vaccine eligibility criteria are still encouraged to preregister. The monkeypox vaccinations are free and based on availability. At the appointment, confirmation of an appointment and proof of residency will be required.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: U.S. immigration officials say 25 Cuban migrants landed in South Florida on Tuesday – the latest arrival amid a mass migration from the island to escape political and economic troubles. The group was seen sitting off the side of the road by a beachside park in Key Biscayne in the early morning and included women and a few children, who were all taken into custody. Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said via Twitter it was a smuggling incident that was being investigated. Between last October and May, Customs and Border Protection officials have found and detained about 1,000 Cubans arriving in Florida. Meanwhile, as of Sunday, the U.S. Coast Guard said it had stopped more than 3,000 Cubans at sea since last October. The majority of Cubans continue to migrate by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 140,000 arriving since last October – a number that exceeds the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when more than 124,700 Cubans came to the U.S. Cuba is seeing its worst economic crisis in decades due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tightening of U.S. sanctions. Last summer, people staged massive protests, which ended in hundreds of arrests, according to nongovernmental groups.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLithonia: A man became trapped while trying to crawl down through a vent from a strip mall roof into a pizza restaurant Tuesday, forcing firefighters to slice open the vent to free him, police said. The man was taken to a hospital, and the extent of his injuries was unclear. Police told local news outlets that emergency responders cut open the vent where it extended upward from a pizza oven at a Little Caesars outlet in suburban Lithonia, about 15 miles east of downtown Atlanta. Brittany Davis, a U.S. Army recruiter, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution she could hear the man yelling for help when she arrived for work at a neighboring recruiting office. “I looked on the roof but couldn’t see anybody,” Davis said. She called 911. Davis said a Little Caesars employee told her he could hear the man’s voice coming from inside the oven. Davis said she went inside the pizza restaurant and spoke to the man, who reported he was in pain and having a panic attack. “I’m not sure what time the restaurant closes at night, but the oven still gives off heat after they close, I imagine,” DeKalb County Fire Cpt. Jason Daniels told WXIA-TV. “For him to get down into the pipe … he had to do it in a certain window of time when the oven was cool enough, and obviously nobody was there.” The man walked to an ambulance shortly after being removed and was taken to a hospital. Police did not identify him or announce any criminal charges.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island was given new land Tuesday in a deal that will protect and manage a pristine white sand beach and ocean bay area that is home to endangered and endemic species and to rare, culturally significant Native Hawaiian artifacts. Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit land preservation group, transferred its ownership of Pohue Bay and surrounding land to the National Park Service. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has the world’s largest and most active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Most of the coastline where the bay is located is made of ancient lava flows, black rock and sea cliffs that dart out into the ocean. Pohue Bay, a rare and idyllic oasis in an otherwise rugged landscape, is home to endangered hawksbill sea turtles, green sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other species found only in Hawaii. The area houses anchialine ponds – landlocked pools with a mix of fresh and salt water – where rare Hawaiian red shrimp called ʻōpaeʻula live. The area is also culturally significant because it has remains of ancient Hawaiian villages, petroglyphs, burial sites and the largest known abrader tool quarry in the state, according to the Trust for Public Lands. Abraders are ancient tools used for sanding, smoothing and grinding.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lame-duck Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has given a big pay boost to an administrative assistant who is also a top state Republican Party official in a move that could hinder the ability of the next lieutenant governor by significantly depleting the office’s budget before January’s power transition. In an email Monday, McGeachin informed the Idaho Division of Financial Management that Machele Hamilton would go from part time to full time and jump from $20,000 to $77,000 annually. Her hourly pay is an increase from $20 an hour to about $37 an hour. Her title in the new role is director of strategy and constituent services. She is also the first vice-chair of the Idaho Republican Party. Hamilton is making about $30,000 more than McGeachin’s former chief of staff, Jordan Watters, who resigned in March when McGeachin couldn’t stay within last year’s budget. It’s not clear why Hamilton is being paid so much more than Watters, whose chief of staff duties would likely have included everything in the title Hamilton was given. Hamilton answered the phone for McGeachin’s office Tuesday afternoon but said McGeachin wasn’t available. Hamilton declined to comment about her employment in the office, and McGeachin didn’t respond to a message left with Hamilton by the Associated Press concerning Hamilton’s employment.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A Wisconsin doctor has purchased two clinical buildings in northern Illinois where he plans to offer abortion pills as early as Friday at one location and surgical abortions within six months at the other site. The move comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last month. That led abortion providers in Wisconsin to stop the procedures while the courts determine whether the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions stands. Abortion remains legal in Illinois, making it a likely draw for residents of many other states in the Midwest and even the South. Dr. Dennis Christensen said he’s part of a group trying to revive abortion services in Rockford, in part to accommodate Wisconsin patients. Christensen is an obstetrician-gynecologist who has provided abortions in Madison and Milwaukee and is now mostly retired, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. He recently purchased a former acupuncture office for $75,000 and the former Animal Emergency Clinic of Rockford for $350,000, according to the Winnebago County records. The newly formed Rockford Family Planning Foundation is fundraising and is preparing the second site for surgical abortions, birth control and related care. “We feel like it’s absolutely essential for us to get open as quickly as possible,” said Jeanne Bissell, the group’s president.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Students across the state had small improvements in their English and math scores, with standardized test results released Wednesday indicating a tentative bright spot following years of pandemic-disrupted learning. Results for the spring 2022 ILEARN exam from the Indiana Department of Education show the statewide percentage of students meeting their grade expectations for math climbing to 39.4% from 2021’s 36.9%. The English proficiency levels rose to 41.2%, up from last year’s 40.5%. ILEARN was first implemented in 2019 to replace the state’s ISTEP exam for students from third to eighth grade. The state did not test students in 2020 because of COVID-19-related school shutdowns. Students with passing scores remain about 7 or 8 percentage points below 2019’s pre-pandemic pass rates. The 2022 report also says most grades saw slight increases in passing scores, with the exception of sixth and eighth graders, who saw minor decreases in English scores. All grade levels’ math proficiency increased at least 2 percentage points since 2021. Charity Flores, chief academic officer at the Department of Education, presented the findings to the Board of Education on Wednesday. This year marks the second year of recovery, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds declined Tuesday to say whether she would get behind a so-called red flag law in Iowa after a new bipartisan federal gun safety law would offer funding to states that enact them. Reynolds, a Republican, said she wouldn’t rule it out and plans to “take a look at everything.” But she also said that she believes red flag laws have not stopped some shootings in other states and that Iowa needs to have a “balance” that recognizes the rights of gun owners as it moves forward. “When we focus on one solution to the issues that we see with active shooters, we tend to, I think, not think about what other solutions are,” she said. “And we eliminate potential things that we can do right away.” Extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws, allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia currently have red flag laws in place. Many of those states are clustered in regions of the U.S. largely governed by Democrats, but some states run by Republicans such as Florida and Indiana also have them. Such laws have gained some bipartisan support, including among U.S. lawmakers as 29 Republicans joined Democrats to pass the federal gun safety law in late June.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas State Board of Education is looking to veteran teachers to help mitigate staff shortages this fall. The board on Tuesday passed a measure giving any retired educator who previously held a Kansas teaching license an easier pathway back into the classroom during the 2022-23 school year. The new transitional license option, intended for retired educators whose prior teaching credentials have been lapsed for at least six months, streamlines the process and eliminates application fees and professional development requirements needed for typical license renewals. Applicants will still have to pay $50 for a background check, since the state education department outsources that work. Over the past five years, teacher retirements ebbed, but they ticked back up in the past five years, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. In 2020, the agency recorded 785 educators as having retired, but in 2022, KSDE has reported a record-high 986 teacher retirements, said Shane Carter, director of teacher licensure. However, the department in the past few years has also seen a surge in the number of retired teachers who have renewed their teaching license, Carter said, more than doubling from 368 retired teacher renewals in 2020 to 766 in 2022.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A medical marijuana advisory team formed by Gov. Andy Beshear will hold a town hall on the issue Thursday evening in northern Kentucky. The Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee is traveling around the state to gather views on the issue and provide feedback to the governor’s office. The next town hall is set for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at Northern Kentucky University’s student union ballroom in Highland Heights, a statement from the Justice & Public Safety Cabinet said. Other meetings are set for Tuesday at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet in Frankfort and July 25 at Hopkinsville Community College. The first meeting was held July 6 in Pikeville. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey and Public Protection Secretary Ray Perry serve as co-chairs of the 17-member panel. It includes health care professionals, members of law enforcement and advocates for medical marijuana.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State authorities have once again been blocked from enforcing a near-total ban on abortion, this time under a judge’s order released Tuesday by a state court in Baton Rouge. Judge Donald Johnson’s order halts enforcement temporarily while lawyers for a north Louisiana clinic and other supporters of abortion rights pursue a lawsuit challenging the legislation. Johnson set a hearing for next Monday. State Attorney General Jeff Landry criticized the ruling in a series of posts on Twitter. “To have the judiciary create a legal circus is disappointing,” Landry wrote in one post. “The rule of law must be followed, and I will not rest until it is. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer for that to happen.” Kathaleen Pittman, director of the north Louisiana clinic that was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, expressed relief in a phone interview. Pittman said the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport is ready to resume counseling and abortions. Louisiana’s two other clinics are in the capital, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. “We look forward to arguing for a preliminary injunction before Judge Johnson next Monday and, in the meantime, we take solace in the fact that crucial healthcare for women has been restored in the state of Louisiana,” Joanna Wright, an attorney for the clinic, said in an email.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal circuit court has reinstated a ban on lobster fishing gear in a nearly 1,000-square-mile area off New England to try to protect endangered whales. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations last year that prohibited lobster fishing with vertical buoy lines in part of the fall and winter in the area, which is in federal waters off Maine’s coast. The ruling was intended to prevent North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340, from becoming entangled in the lines. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston vacated that ruling Tuesday. The circuit court sent the case back to the district court level but noted in its ruling that it does not think the lobster fishing groups that sued to stop the regulations are likely to succeed because Congress has clearly instructed the fisheries service to protect the whales. “Although this does not mean the balance will always come out on the side of an endangered marine mammal, it does leave plaintiffs beating against the tide, with no more success than they had before,” the court ruled.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Commercial and recreational fishermen woke up Sunday to new mako shark regulations from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to boost the number of the migratory predator. Michael Luisi, acting director of the department’s Fishing and Boating Services, said a zero retention limit was established for shortfin mako sharks in both commercial and recreational fishing. Prior to that, a very limited number of the species could be retained. Luisi said penalties for doing so would include “severe and hefty” fines for violators. “Most shark fishermen are going to be up on the regulations because they have to just go fishing,” said Mark Sampson, captain of the charter boat Fish Finder, based in Ocean City. “But your average guy that goes out to catch tuna or black sea bass might not have taken the time to learn shark regulations. So if he accidently catches one on his line, he won’t know if it’s a keeper or not. Those anglers are the ones that are the most frustrated with regulations.” After 40 years of being at the helm of a charter boat, Sampson remains busy with clients that do not always plan on coming back with a shark. For some, the experience is enough. The average season for shark fishing runs from mid-May to October, with mako sharks caught to mid-June.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A family’s beloved pet cat that’s been dodging airport personnel, airline employees and animal experts since escaping from a pet carrier at Logan International Airport about three weeks ago was finally caught Wednesday. “Whether out of fatigue or hunger we’ll never know, but this morning she finally let herself be caught,” an airport spokesperson said in a statement. The cat, named Rowdy, was given a health check and will be returned to her family. “I’m kind of in disbelief,” said her owner, Patty Sahli. “I thought, ‘What are the odds we’re actually going to get her back?’ But I got a call this morning, and I am just so shocked.” Rowdy’s time on the lam began June 24, as Sahli and her husband, Rich, returned to the U.S. from 15 years in Germany with the Army. When their Lufthansa flight landed, the 4-year-old black cat with green eyes escaped her cage, in pursuit of some birds. Soon Rowdy herself was on the receiving end of a chase, as her getaway set off a massive search involving airport and Lufthansa personnel, construction workers, and animal welfare advocates, as well as the use of wildlife cameras and safe-release traps. Despite numerous sightings, Rowdy always eluded her pursuers – but now, a little calm has been restored. “It was such a community effort,” Sahli said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: An effort to lock certain voting rights into the Michigan Constitution has taken a major step toward the fall ballot, eclipsing a rival campaign led by Republicans to limit absentee voting and add other restrictions. Promote the Vote, a coalition of 27 groups, submitted nearly 670,000 signatures Monday. While the signatures still must be validated by election officials, the petitions contain about 245,000 more names than necessary to qualify for the Nov. 8 election. The ballot question would expand voter rights by allowing nine days of in-person early voting, state-funded absentee ballot postage and drop boxes in every community. Promote the Vote is the same coalition that helped pass no-reason absentee voting and same-day voter registration in 2018. Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, said the campaign “observed the 2020 election, and even the 2018 election, and we see where there could be improvements.” In addition to increased access to early voting, the constitutional amendment would require 24-hour absentee ballot drop boxes in every community. Voters could also join a permanent list to have absentee ballots sent for every election. And it would require election audits to be conducted in public by state and county officials and certified based only on the official records of votes cast. Some portions are already in Michigan law, but the state has seen attempts at “manipulating the language in that law, and we want to make sure we close those loopholes,” Spencer said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local governments in the state are trying to find creative solutions to managing the cost of fueling their fleets of vehicles as gas prices remain high. With gas prices recently near $5 a gallon in the Twin Cities, municipal leaders are looking to keep police squad cars, fire engines, dump trucks and park equipment fueled, yet stay on budget. The city of Buffalo is urging carpooling and checking tire pressure on its vehicles to stretch a tank of gas. “We’re projecting we will be coming in over our fuel budget,” said Taylor Gronau, Buffalo’s assistant city administrator. “However, a lot of those trips are necessary and needed.” Several communities are trying to add more electric and hybrid vehicles to their fleets – only to find huge backlogs, the Star Tribune reports. Earlier this summer, Minneapolis started a program that gave home inspectors the option of taking e-bikes to job sites. It saved wear and tear on the vehicle fleet and cut the city’s gas consumption. Several other city agencies, including IT and public works staff, are also looking into e-bikes. While dozens of local governments are under state fuel contacts, which cover a majority of fuel purchases in bulk and at a fixed rate, many other communities don’t participate, including Buffalo, which relies on retail gas stations to fuel its fleet.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearl River County: A volunteer fire department lost the use of three trucks when its own station went up in flames. WLOX TV reports the fire happened Monday night at the Nicholson Volunteer Fire Department station. Nicholson is a community in Pearl River County, near the Gulf Coast and the Louisiana state line. Five neighboring firefighting agencies assisted in fighting the blaze. Three trucks were heavily damaged, according to the TV station. And a county press release said several other pieces of key firefighting equipment were destroyed in the fire. Former Nicholson fire Chief Bobby Robbins estimated the damage at $1 million and said it could take roughly 100 days to have the equipment replaced. There were no injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Robbins said the trucks were donated by Deep South, a company from which the team is now considering renting. The Pearl River County Fire Marshal said officials are working with other agencies in the meantime to borrow equipment. Authorities must determine how the fire started as well as how to provide immediate protection in Nicholson without the fire trucks, equipment and a usable firehouse.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Developers announced plans Monday to expand the capacity of a controversial wind power transmission line so much that it would match that of four new nuclear power plants. Invenergy Transmission, the Chicago-based company attempting to build the Grain Belt Express, now says the project will be able to deliver 5,000 megawatts of power, about 25% more than originally planned, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Investment in the project, which would stretch about 800 miles from Kansas to Indiana on a route crossing Missouri and Illinois, also would soar to about $7 billion, Invenergy said. Various municipal utilities in Missouri have long intended to buy power from the project, but now five times as much electricity will be delivered to the state – rising from 500 to 2,500 megawatts, compared to earlier plans. The project will help unlock $7.5 billion in energy cost savings in Missouri and Illinois, according to its developers. The Grain Belt Express has the support of several area advocacy groups, including the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and the Associated Industries of Missouri. But some farmers who don’t want high-power transmission lines on their land have fought the project.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: The scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park opened for the 2022 summer season Wednesday after a spring marked by heavy snow and cool temperatures delayed plowing and maintenance work, park officials said. The July 13 opening matches the road’s latest opening dates since it first opened to the public on July 15, 1933. The alpine highway also opened July 13 in 2011 due to a late snowpack and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vehicle reservations are needed to travel on Going-to-the-Sun Road and can be obtained at the recreation.gov website. The $2 timed entry reservation fee is in addition to the $35-per-vehicle park entry fee. Timed reservations are also needed to enter the North Fork area, but they are not needed to enter other parts of the park such as Many Glacier, Two Medicine, St. Mary or the Chief Mountain Highway. The park’s free shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road operates on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Supporters of the late Malcolm X are making a new push to get him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The Omaha native was nominated 15 years ago but rejected amid concerns of controversy, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A Malcolm X Memorial Foundation board member submitted a nomination for the next class of honorees – selected every five years – for the human rights activist, who was born as Malcolm Little in 1925 and was assassinated in 1965. JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike called him “one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history,” according to the World-Herald, and putting him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame would push “the rest of the state to know about the true civil rights history of Omaha.” Malcolm X is one of eight Nebraskans nominated this year. New members may only be named at least 35 years after their deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno is expecting fall enrollment to match numbers from a year ago – still down from pre-pandemic levels, when the campus saw record enrollment of 21,000 in the fall of 2019. “We are all least even where we were last year,” UNR President Brian Sandoval said. At UNR, fall 2020 enrollment, including non-degree-seeking students, was 19,961. It climbed to 20,129 in fall 2021. The state’s seven colleges – including Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas – have all felt the effects of closing campuses and moving classes online. Enrollment systemwide topped 112,427 in the fall of 2019, according to data from the Nevada System of Higher Education. In 2021, enrollment was 106,259. Spring 2022 enrollment was estimated at 95,446 across the seven institutions. Among the factors affecting enrollment, Sandoval said, are the hardships students experienced from COVID-19, travel restrictions including for foreign students, and fewer Californians enrolling as the neighboring state has dramatically increased its admissions. “Students are challenged on a lot of levels,” Sandoval said, adding that housing prices and inflation are also affecting how many can afford higher education.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge has consolidated hundreds of lawsuits alleging physical and sexual abuse at the state’s youth detention center, more than two years after the first case was filed. David Meehan sued the state, the youth center, agencies that oversee it and multiple former employees in January 2020, alleging he endured near-daily rapes and beatings at the Youth Development Center in Manchester in the 1990s. At the time, he was one of about three dozen men and women who had come forward, but since then, about 450 have filed lawsuits alleging abuse by 150 staffers over six decades. The civil litigation has largely been on hold since 11 former youth workers were arrested last year, but a judge last week kicked it into high gear with an order setting out the consolidation process. While consolidation brings the “the risk of cookie-cutter dispositions,” proceeding with individual cases would present a “backbreaking clerical burden” for the court, said Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Andrew Schulman. The state is expected to produce more than 3 million pages of documents in the initial discovery phase. Discovery likely will take several months, and groups of cases will be combined for joint trials, lawyers said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A new “strike force” within the state attorney general’s office will aim to enforce New Jersey laws that protect the right to an abortion, working to make sure that patient confidentiality and personal health information are secure and that patients and providers are not threatened or intimidated by protesters. The Reproductive Rights Task Force announced Monday by acting Attorney General Matt Platkin is intended to ensure the full implementation of laws that give New Jersey some of the strongest protections for abortion rights in the United States. As other states ban or severely restrict abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the 49-year constitutional right to an abortion in the United States, New Jersey is expected to become a haven for people from those states who are seeking the procedures. Two laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on July 1 bar the extradition of people who receive or perform an abortion in New Jersey to those states that restrict or criminalize the procedure and prohibit public agencies from aiding investigations conducted by those states into abortions provided in the Garden State. The new group of attorneys and law enforcement officers within New Jersey’s Department of Law and Public Safety “will ensure that these laws are enforced to the full extent possible, and that we use every available resource to protect access to abortion care in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Physicians and researchers are urging state lawmakers to allow the use of psychedelic mushrooms in mental health therapy aimed at overcoming depression, anxiety, psychological trauma and alcoholism. A legislative panel on Tuesday listened to advocates who hope to broaden the scope of medical treatment and research assisted by psilocybin, the psychedelic active ingredient in certain mushrooms. Oregon is so far the only state to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin. Recent studies indicate psilocybin could be useful in the treatment of major depression, including mental suffering among terminally ill patients, and for substance abuse including alcoholism, with low risks of addiction or overdose under medical supervision. Physician Lawrence Leeman, a medicine professor at the University of New Mexico, urged legislators to move forward without waiting for federal decriminalization or regulatory approval to expand responsible therapies using doses of psilocybin. Leeman and other advocates outlined emerging psilocybin protocols, involving six-hour supervised sessions and extensive discussions about the experience in subsequent counseling. He warned legislators that public interest is spawning illicit, underground experimentation without safeguards.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Soaring demand for the monkeypox vaccine caused the appointment system to crash in New York City, one of many places where supplies have been running out almost as soon as they arrive. City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the vaccine and vowed to build a “stable appointment infrastructure” as the vaccine supply increases. U.S. infections now exceed 1,000 from the growing outbreak. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. Vaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection, regardless of their sexual orientation. “After COVID, this should have been easy,” said Daniel Ross, 25, a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday. “I kept refreshing and refreshing. … I was frustrated.” Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal, which went down minutes after it went live. “It’s going to haunt me,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Local Republicans are planning a 30-day raffle of guns and ammunition, a move that’s drawing criticism in light of recent mass shootings across the U.S. The Forsyth County Republican Party will offer semi-automatic weapons, among other guns, in the raffle, the Winston-Salem Journal reports. Organizer Vernon Robinson said each raffle ticket will bear a three-digit number the purchaser can check each day against one of the games in the North Carolina Education Lottery from Sept. 9 through Oct. 8 to determine the winner. “The biggest problem with raffles is that the buyers can’t be sure the folks who are conducting it are playing it straight with the numbers,” Robinson said. “The way we solve that problem is to use the N.C. Education Lottery’s daily Pick 3 numbers.” A lottery spokesman said the agency does not know of any law that prevents other groups from using publicly released drawing numbers to decide their own raffles. Robinson said he hopes the fundraiser will net the party some $9,000 to $10,000 to “beat Democrats.” “The only people who are upset about gun raffles are people who are hostile to guns and gun owners,” he said. Kevin Farmer, chairman of the Forsyth County Democratic Party, said the move was “disappointing but, given the extremist nature of the Republican Party, not at all surprising.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State Attorney General Drew Wrigley on Tuesday rejected calls to release body camera footage of a fatal police shooting in Fargo and said he will personally oversee the case himself. Wrigley’s announcement came a day after family members and their supporters demanded to see video in the death of 28-year-old Shane Netterville, of Jamestown. About 50 people gathered Monday evening outside Fargo City Hall in a protest organized by a Native American group. Wrigley said the footage will be made public once all the proceedings are complete. “As a matter of course, law enforcement does not release evidence to the media for public consumption,” he said, noting there are only limited exceptions. Officer Adam O’Brien, an 11-year veteran of the department, shot Netterville on Friday after police responded to a report of people slumped over in a van. A police report said when officers arrived and tried to make contact with the occupants, the vehicle began to travel directly toward officers, and O’Brien fired. Netterville was driving the van, which police said had been reported stolen. Another man was arrested at the scene after he reportedly ignored commands of officers and was found to have methamphetamine. A third person who fled the scene was apprehended Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Division of Police will refer for internal review only one of 24 alleged misconduct cases during the 2020 racial injustice protests presented by an investigative team, police said Tuesday. Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement that she would only be referring one sergeant to the Internal Affairs Bureau for an administrative investigation. The referrals came after an investigation by retired FBI agent Richard Wozniak and Columbus Special Prosecutor Kathleen Garber, who were tasked in 2020 with looking into alleged criminal misconduct by officers during protests in May and June following the murder of George Floyd Jr. by then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. In the statement, Bryant said she “immediately put together a team” to see which, if any, of the cases could be investigated further. Bryant noted that any administrative investigation must also comply with the contract with Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, which mandates that all investigations occur within 90 days of the receipt of the complaint. Only one case fell within the 90-day time frame because the clock was stopped while the sergeant’s conduct was under a criminal investigation, Bryant said in the statement. The criminal investigation concluded May 27.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: People who believe they are descendants of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre can now provide genetic material to help scientists when they begin trying to identify remains of possible victims. Danny Hellwig, laboratory director with Intermountain Forensics, said Wednesday that researchers are not ready to begin trying to match DNA for identification, but an outpouring of requests from local residents on how to provide genetic material led them to begin the process of accepting donations. “That’s what prompted this,” Hellwig said. “We didn’t expect the amount of support and willingness to help … people have jumped out of the woodwork” to offer their DNA for testing. Black people who had ancestors in Tulsa in 1921 are sought, Hellwig said. “What we need is to populate these databases with family lines” of direct descendants, making identifications of the remains possible within days, Hellwig said. “If we’re only matched with very distant relatives, it can take much longer,” with previous efforts to make such matches taking four years or more, he said. The Salt Lake City nonprofit foundation is examining 14 sets of remains removed from a Tulsa cemetery a year ago and has said at least two of the remains contains enough usable DNA for testing for possible identification.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Far-right Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson’s trial started this week on one count of felony riot in connection with a brawl outside a Portland bar in 2019. Jury selection began Monday and is scheduled to continue through Thursday, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Prosecutors allege Gibson instigated a street fight between Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists May 1, 2019, at the now-closed bar Cider Riot. In an arrest warrant affidavit, Deputy District Attorney Brad Kalbaugh said video of the brawl shows Gibson and his two co-defendants “taunting and physically threatening members of the Antifa group in an effort clearly designed to provoke a physical altercation.” Three other brawl participants with the Patriot Prayer group, Chris Ponte, Ian Kramer and Matthew Cooper, were indicted and pleaded guilty. Kramer, who knocked a woman unconscious and fractured her vertebrae with a baton, pleaded guilty to riot, assault and unlawful use of a weapon. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and five years of probation. Ponte, who prosecutors said threw a rock and hurt a woman, pleaded guilty to a riot charge in a plea deal. He was sentenced to three years probation and 10 days in jail. Cooper pleaded guilty to riot and was sentenced to three years’ probation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor tweeted he had “big news” Tuesday, announcing the state budget passed in recent days includes funding for three new state parks. Gov. Tom Wolf’s press secretary, Beth Rementer, subsequently said the park sites haven’t been chosen, but work to identify and purchase the land is underway by the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The state’s 2022-23 spending plan includes $56 million to add the new state parks to what is currently a 121-park system. The three will be the first new state parks in Pennsylvania since 2005, not counting Washington Crossing, which was transferred from the state Historical and Museum Commission. The money will also help develop the state’s first park for the use of all-terrain vehicles and similar motorized recreational vehicles. “Our beautiful state parks are among the finest in the nation,” Wolf tweeted. “I’m proud that we secured funding in this year’s budget to make this investment in our park system.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman who authorities say pretended to be a decorated Marine Corps veteran with cancer to fraudulently collect about $250,000 in veterans benefits and charitable contributions has agreed to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Sarah Jane Cavanaugh, 31, of East Greenwich, signed an agreement in U.S. District Court in Providence under which she will admit to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of medals, U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said in a statement. She has also agreed to pay more than $82,000 in restitution. She faces more than 20 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of sentencing guidelines, according to court documents. Cavanaugh’s attorney, Kensley Barrett, said Tuesday that while he appreciates the interest that the case has garnered, he has no comment at this time. There is no record of Cavanaugh ever serving in the U.S. military, according to authorities. However, she did work as a licensed social worker for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence. Through her job, she gained access to documents, personal information and medical records belonging to a real veteran with cancer, which she used to create fraudulent documents and medical records in her name, prosecutors said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawyer for disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh said Tuesday that investigators have indicated they intend to pursue murder charges against him for the deaths of his wife and son, who were fatally shot outside their home more than a year ago. Lawyer Jim Griffin said in a statement that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division told Murdaugh family members they plan to seek indictments from a grand jury later this week. “We won’t have any comment until charges are actually brought against Alex,” Griffin said. Officials with both state police and the attorney general’s office would not comment on whether authorities were pursuing the indictments, which were first reported by news and opinion website FITSNews. Murdaugh already faces dozens of criminal charges that have piled up in the months since his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed. But until now he has not been charged in connection with their deaths; he’s repeatedly denied any role in those killings. The deaths led to at least a half-dozen investigations into Murdaugh and his finances resulting in charges that he stole $8.5 million from people who hired him and that he lied to police in saying he was shot by a stranger on a roadside when – officials say – he really asked a friend to kill him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Citizens who called the National Weather Service concerned about some “silvery objects” in the sky around the city this week prompted the agency to tweet that the objects were not aliens but rather test balloons launched by a South Dakota aerospace subsidiary. “Sorry, not aliens,” the NWS tweeted in response to the calls it received. The high-altitude balloons were launched by Raven Aerostar, a subsidiary of Raven Industries. “As a South Dakota company and the world leader in stratospheric balloon technology, our team conducts stratospheric balloon flights throughout the year, and many of them are launched from our dedicated hangar near Baltic,” Aerostar president Jim Nelson said. “Two of our Thunderhead Balloon Systems are currently over Sioux Falls.” The balloons, which look like hot air balloons, operate miles above the surface of the earth. Once a balloon reaches the stratosphere, it changes from a teardrop to a pumpkin shape, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Aerostar said the balloons have a variety of uses, including monitoring wildfires, expanding cellular networks and military reconnaissance. They navigate by autonomously changing altitude to take advantage of wind currents in the atmosphere.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is increasing its investment by $1.4 billion for a strategic plan that includes programs advancing the study and treatment of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases, the hospital said Wednesday. The additional funding is part of a six-year expansion plan that launched last year, and it will raise the six-year operating and capital budget to $12.9 billion, the Memphis-based hospital said in a news release. New funding will affect scientific operations, clinical care, global medicine and infrastructure. The number of new jobs will increase from from 1,400 to 2,300, while funds for construction, renovation and capital needs will rise from from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the hospital said. As part of the expansion plan, more investment will be seen in areas including structural biology, advanced microscopy, data sciences, global childhood cancer care, and collaborative projects involving St. Jude and scientists across the U.S. and the world, the hospital said. Additional funds also will be used on construction projects including Domino’s Village, a 140-unit housing facility; the Family Commons, a treatment-free zone for patients and their families to rest and enjoy themselves; and two 15-story towers dedicated to patient care and clinical research, St. Jude said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas student leaders are advocating for campus officials to “protect reproductive rights” and take action in response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last month and the state’s ban on abortions. A statement released by the student-run UT Coalition for Reproductive Justice and Rights on Tuesday includes a series of demands, including calling for UT leadership to expand sex education and reproductive health care resources, support adding an emergency contraceptive vending machine on campus, and advocate for reproductive health care access. “We unequivocally support reproductive rights, justice, and autonomy for all. The right to control our bodies and the ability to make healthcare decisions that should be private should not belong to any government or anyone other than ourselves,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with all abortion-seekers affected by this decision.” Sameeha Rizvi, vice president of the student-run UT Senate, said the coalition published the statement to emphasize “the lack of response from the university” to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She said students believed that collective action would help persuade UT to potentially take action on the demands.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man is in custody after police say he admitted attempting to hang one man and killing another as part of a “purge” that he claimed was directed by a higher power. Christian Francis Taele, 28, was arrested after police responding to a report of an assault found the 23-year-old victim strung from a piece of gym equipment at an apartment complex in Ogden on Saturday evening. It was unclear if Taele had an attorney who can speak on his behalf. KSL-TV reports he is being held for investigation of attempted murder. Witnesses said Taele, of Lake Shore, approached the victim, strangled him with a rope or strap, and kicked him numerous times before dragging him into the gym. The man was hospitalized and had no signs of brain activity. “The attack was unprovoked, and there is no indication that either the suspect or victim have ever spoken prior to the attack,” police wrote in an affidavit. While Ogden police were interviewing Taele, investigators say he confessed to a homicide in Spanish Fork and provided details of the slaying and the crime scene that had not been publicized. In that case, the body of 49-year-old Ryan Hooley was found next to a trash bin Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Leaders of the Vermont Army National Guard are investigating allegations of misconduct in recent months following a report made public last year on the Guard’s culture and policies. Vermont Adj. Gen. Greg Knight said in a statement Monday that he could not elaborate on the investigations but that it’s critical for members to know that “all members are, and will continue to be held accountable regardless of rank or position.” “I am disappointed that poor decisions and behavior continue to happen, but am glad to see our members report bad behavior when they see it,” he said. In November 2019, Knight requested an assessment by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations. The 113-page report released last year found the Vermont National Guard’s sexual assault polices lacked specifics to ensure compliance, a prevention program had inadequate resources, and many personnel perceived favoritism and a “good old boy” network. The investigation concluded that “the command climate and culture within the VTNG is generally sound, though there is room for improvement,” and made 35 recommendations. “Our people are by far the most important part of our organization,” Knight said in the statement. “These investigations are a result of our people trusting the process, and reporting aberrant behavior to the chain of command.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWhitewood: Flooding in a remote pocket of southwest Virginia has damaged more than 100 homes and left some 40 people unaccounted for, but there are no confirmed deaths or injuries, authorities said Wednesday. First responders in Buchanan County began receiving reports of rising water and damage Tuesday night, authorities said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. After daybreak, crews conducted aerial surveys to examine the extent of the disaster. Several small communities in the Virginia county that borders West Virginia and Kentucky were affected, according to the sheriff’s office. About 40 people – a mix of adults and children – were reported unaccounted for, but that number was expected to decrease as swift-water rescue teams continued to survey the area, authorities said. A shelter was established at a local school. Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Eric Breeding said the number of persons unaccounted for was based on relatives trying to contact a resident in an area where there may be limited or no phone service. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in trouble or in danger. They’re just letting us know that we need to check on these people,” Breeding said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, prosecutors said. According to King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office spokesperson Casey McNerthney, a judge on Monday ordered the 48-year-old man to remain jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail but denied prosecutors’ request for an anti-harassment order protecting Jayapal, The Seattle Times reports. In 2016, Jayapal became the first Indian American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Seattle police arrested the man outside Jayapal’s house at 11:25 p.m. Saturday after she called 911 and reported an unknown person or people were in a vehicle using obscene language, a probable cause statement said. She told a dispatcher her husband thought someone may have fired a pellet gun, the statement said. Officers arrested a man who was standing in the middle of the street with his hands in the air and a .40-caliber handgun holstered on his waist, the probable cause statement said. A neighbor told police she heard the man yell something to the effect of “go back to India, I’m going to kill you,” the statement said. The neighbor also said the man drove by Jayapal’s residence at least three times, yelling profanities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A helicopter crash last month that killed six people occurred when the aircraft hit a rock face 15 minutes after takeoff from a local airport, federal investigators said in a preliminary report Tuesday. The Vietnam-era Bell UH-1B “Huey” helicopter struck the rock face in an area about 4 miles from Logan County Airport in Amherstdale, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in the report. The cockpit and cabin then crashed into a roadway and a guardrail and were consumed by fire. Investigators have not yet released any information about the cause of the accident. A final report could take a year or two to complete, they said. The June 22 flight was the last scheduled for the day during a multiday reunion for helicopter enthusiasts where visitors could sign up to ride or fly the historic Huey helicopter, described by organizers as one of the last of its kind still flying. The helicopter was flown by the 114th Assault Helicopter Company, “The Knights of the Sky,” in Vinh Long, Vietnam, throughout much of the 1960s, according to the website for MARPAT Aviation, a Logan County flight school that operated the helicopter. After the Huey returned to the U.S. in 1971, the website says, it was featured in movies such as “Die Hard, “The Rock” and “Under Siege: Dark Territory.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A federal judge is siding with the Sun Prairie School District in a lawsuit filed by two Black parents who objected to their children’s middle school assignment that asked students how they would punish a slave in ancient Mesopotamia. Dazrrea Ervins and Priscilla Jones claimed the Black History Month assignment in February 2021 violated their civil rights as well as those of their children. The question was not part of the school district’s curriculum on ancient Mesopotamia. Three teachers came up with the assignment on their own, according to an internal investigation. The teachers were placed on administrative leave and later resigned, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Along with complaints about the assignment, the lawsuit also accused the district of discriminating against one of the children for his learning disability and failing to protect him from racist bullying. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, in Wisconsin’s Western District, said the parents failed to show evidence that their civil rights or those of their children were violated by the assignment. “A reasonable jury certainly could find that its content and timing were offensive, insensitive and justifiably upset students and their families,” Peterson wrote. “But a hostile environment claim requires much more than a single upsetting episode.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local search and rescue responders are hoping to raise donations for a helicopter and secure county support to cover operational costs, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr announced the campaign Monday, saying the county’s search and rescue team responded to a record number of calls for service last year, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/16/john-glenn-centennial-passport-office-pileup-museum-chinese-reopens-news-around-states/117547550/", "title": "John Glenn centennial, passport office pileup: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A military base has ordered troops to show proof of vaccination in order to go without face masks as the state sees an uptick in COVID-19 cases – a rise attributed to low inoculation rates. The measure was put in place Tuesday at Fort Rucker, home of the Army’s aviation program. If a soldier is not wearing a mask, base leadership can ask to see a vaccination card. In a video posted to Facebook, base officials said the measure is needed because of rising case numbers on the base and in surrounding counties. Alabama, which has the lowest vaccination rates in the country, is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases. State Health Officer Scott Harris said that is likely driven both by the low vaccination rates and by the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Alabama has risen over the past two weeks from 205.43 new cases per day June 28 to 559.57 new cases per day July 12. Only about 33% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, compared to about 48% nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s not the vaccinated people that are getting infected for the most part, and if they do, for the most part they aren’t the ones getting sick in the hospital,” Harris said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration said Thursday that it is ending large-scale, old-growth timber sales in the country’s largest national forest – the Tongass National Forest – and will focus on forest restoration, recreation and other noncommercial uses. The U.S. Agriculture Department, which includes the Forest Service, also said it will take steps to reverse a Trump administration decision last year to lift restrictions on logging and road-building in the southeast Alaska rainforest, which provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. A 2001 rule prohibits road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions on nearly one-third of national forest land. The Trump administration moved to exempt the Tongass from those prohibitions, something Alaska political leaders had sought for years. Restoring those protections in the Tongass would return “stability and certainty to the conservation of 9.3 million acres of the world’s largest temperate old growth rainforest,” the Agriculture Department said. Under the plans announced Thursday, large-scale, old-growth projects that were being planned for the forest will not go forward, Moore said. Smaller timber sales, including some old-growth trees, will still be offered for local and cultural uses such as totem poles, canoes and tribal artisan use, the federal agency said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s largest county approved nearly $3 million Wednesday for new vote-counting machines to replace those used in the 2020 election, which were given to legislative Republicans for a partisan review of the results. The GOP-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said the machines were compromised because they were in the control of firms not accredited to handle election equipment. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had said she would seek to decertify the machines if the county planned to use them again. State Senate Republicans used their subpoena power to take control of Maricopa County’s voting machines after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him in Arizona and other battleground states. The Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consulting firm led by a Trump supporter who has spread conspiracy theories backing Trump’s false claims of fraud, to recount all 2.1 million ballots and forensically review voting machines, servers and other data. The firm had no prior experience in elections, and experts in election administration say it’s not following reliable procedures.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas on Thursday said it has asked a former Razorback challenging U.S. Sen. John Boozman to change his ads over their unauthorized use of the school’s trademarks. The school made the request after Jake Bequette launched his bid for the Republican Senate nomination with an online video touting his background playing for the Razorbacks and for the New England Patriots in the NFL. Boozman, a Republican, has held the seat since 2011. The video features footage and images of Bequette playing in his Razorbacks uniform, while a logo says: “Jake Bequette. Patriot. Veteran. Razorback.” “We have asked the campaign to modify its ads related to unauthorized use of the Razorback trademark for political purposes,” UA spokesman Mark Rushing said in an email. Bequette’s campaign did not say whether it planned to change or withdraw the ad. “Jake Bequette is proud of his time at the University of Arkansas where he was an academic All-American and All-SEC defensive end. He will continue to proudly call himself a Razorback,” the campaign said. UA made a similar request when Boozman, also a former Razorback, ran for the Senate in 2010. Boozman pulled a TV ad highlighting his time playing for the Razorbacks after the school asked that it be withdrawn.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County leaders are moving forward with a plan to return prime beachfront property to descendants of a Black couple who built a resort for African Americans but were stripped of the land by city officials a century ago. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to pursue an action plan created by the county chief executive’s office on returning the land to the descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce once the state allows it. The county would be a sponsor of state legislation that is needed to enable the transfer. “We are on an important road to set a precedent that could be replicated across the country as we work to put actions behind our commitment to an anti-racist agenda and anti-racist county,” Supervisor Holly Mitchell said. The property that became known as Bruce’s Beach is along the shoreline in Manhattan Beach, now an upscale city. The land was purchased in 1912 by Willa and Charles Bruce, who built the first West Coast resort for Black people at a time when many beaches were segregated. They suffered racist harassment from white neighbors, and in the 1920s the Manhattan Beach City Council took the land away through eminent domain under the ruse of needing it for a park. The city did nothing with the property, however, and it eventually was transferred to the state in 1948.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A pre-pandemic shortage of licensed commercial drivers in the waste management industry has become worse, and now cities and companies are dealing with a shortage of workers to hoist trash and recyclables into trucks. Workers in the solid-waste industry were considered essential workers as COVID-19 started to spread, but now there aren’t enough of them, and many are likely looking for different lines of work or better pay, The Denver Post reports. Denver is working to hire more sanitation workers after cutting its budget and letting vacancies go unfilled when the pandemic hit, said Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. The city provides trash and recycling collection services to 181,000 households and compost collection service to subscribers. Kuhn said Denver cut back on extra trash collection, which includes large items, from every four weeks to every eight weeks. In June, the city received 1,738 calls about missed trash pickup and 760 about missed recycling pickups. Denver makes about 724,000 trash collections a month. The solid waste industry is among those using signing bonuses to lure back workers as businesses emerge from cutbacks made because of the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State regulators have approved a plan to spur the building of infrastructure across Connecticut for charging electric vehicles. The state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority said the nine-year program approved Wednesday creates incentives for the building of fast charging stations, home charging stations and workplace charging stations, both for individuals with electric cars and for companies that have fleets of electric vehicles. The decision directs the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource Energy and United Illuminating, to provide incentives to customers who install the necessary equipment. Those include rebates of up to $500 to homeowners who make electrical upgrades to allow charging at home and up to $40,000 for owners of apartment buildings, condominium complexes and businesses that install charging areas. The program also would provide up to $250,000 for the creation of direct current fast-charging stations in the state. Those who install the equipment in low-income and distressed communities would get the largest incentives, PURA said. “We’re eager to bring a statewide charging program to our customers and are currently reviewing the details of PURA’s announcement to ensure it maximizes all potential benefits for our customers,” said Mitch Gross, an Eversource spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Residents of Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park say the untreated wastewater surfacing above an older septic system in the center of the park affects the environment, their safety and their quality of life. “This place started out as travel-trailers and weekenders. They didn’t need a big septic unit,” said resident Samuel Saunders. “Now people live here full time, and these tanks won’t hold that. It bubbles up, and it’s bad.” The park owner, Donovan-Smith MHP LLC, was issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on July 8 for unauthorized discharge to groundwater. According to the notice, the park never renewed its septic system permit after it expired in 2008 and has been operating without one since. The department continued to inspect the system annually despite being without a permit, the notice says. DNREC declined to provide inspection records, citing an “ongoing investigation.” Park manager Clara McNichols, when reached by phone, declined to comment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro Board of Directors Safety and Operations Committee approved a proposal Thursday to temporarily ban certain riders cited for sexual or firearms charges while riding the transit system, WUSA-TV reports. The full Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board is expected to vote on the proposal at an upcoming meeting, but a date on that vote has not been set. Metro says it has seen an increase in sex offenses over the past 18 months. The hope is that a change to the passenger conduct policy would help cut down on those incidents. The first offense would carry a 14-day ban and the second a 30-day ban, but the third offense would bring a 365-day rolling suspension that starts the day the citation is issued. Transit agencies in other major cities have similar policies in place.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it planned to build a new regional campus in central Florida to house at least 2,000 professional employees who will be relocating from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. In a letter to employees, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said the move would allow creative and business teams to be better integrated. The company already has a theme park resort outside Orlando, Walt Disney World, that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The new Disney campus will be located about 20 miles to the east of Disney World, in a neighborhood by Orlando International Airport. “Florida is known for its rich culture of hospitality and active lifestyle as well as a lower cost of living with no state income tax,” D’Amaro said in the employee letter. While the company is still figuring out which employees will be asked to relocate, they likely will be in the parks division. Workers asked to relocate will have 18 months to make the move, D’Amaro said. “As someone who has moved with my family from California to Florida and back again, I understand that relocation is a big change, not only for the employee, but also for their families,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Donald Trump is declaring his opposition to a high-ranking Republican’s bid for lieutenant governor, another sign of how state-level politics is being reordered by Trump’s insistence that all Republicans repudiate his 2020 election loss. Trump invited other Republicans to run against Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller in a statement released late Wednesday. “I will not be supporting or endorsing Sen. Butch Miller, running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, because of his refusal to work with other Republican senators on voter fraud and irregularities in the state,” Trump said. “Hopefully there will be strong and effective primary challengers for the very important lieutenant governor position!” Trump weighed in as state Sen. Burt Jones of Jackson considers seeking the GOP nomination to succeed Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose support among Republicans collapsed after his outspoken defense of the Georgia election results that gave Joe Biden a narrow victory. Miller has not gone as far as Jones in promoting the false claim that Trump was cheated out of 16 electoral votes, but he counts Georgia’s restrictive new elections law among his top accomplishments and has said voters will support him as a conservative who gets things done.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. authorities launched an investigation and fined Louisiana tourists honeymooning in Hawaii after a video on social media showed a woman touching an endangered Hawaiian monk seal. The couple were “deeply sorry,” a man identified as Stephen told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We love Hawaii and the culture. We didn’t mean to offend anyone.” A video posted on TikTok and other social media showed a woman touching the seal at a Kauai beach in June. The video showed her running away after the resting seal raised its head and snapped at her. There are an estimated 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 300 in the main Hawaiian Islands. It’s a felony to touch or harass a Hawaiian monk seal under state and federal laws, with penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The newspaper reports authorities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contacted the couple over the weekend and assessed an undisclosed fine. Dominic Andrews, a spokesman for NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, said an investigation is underway and declined to comment further.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prisons in the state are so understaffed that correctional officers often end up working mandatory 16-hour shifts, leaving them just eight hours to sleep, eat and see their families before returning to duty, a prison official said. Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt told Board of Correction members about the staff shortages during a meeting Wednesday, saying roughly one-quarter of correctional officer positions are vacant. “We’ve seen a very alarming new trend in our staffing that is cause for concern for us,” Tewalt said, noting that there are about 180 vacant positions statewide. Most of the vacancies are in the five-prison complex south of Boise, where 156 correctional officer positions are vacant. That’s the lowest staffing rate the state has seen in the past six years, according to department data. The staff shortage means there are frequently not enough employees to allow prisoners to move normally throughout their daily schedule, forcing facilities to go on “restricted” status during which offenders may be denied time in recreational yards or day room areas. The shortage also means visiting hours can’t be held in some prisons. Prison understaffing can lead to dangerous conditions for workers and inmates and limit inmate access to programs designed to help them succeed upon release.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated with a lack of power to investigate unethical conduct by state lawmakers and an ethics reform bill on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk that she considered counterproductive, the Illinois legislative inspector general said Wednesday that she will resign in December. Carol Pope, 67, a former Menard County state’s attorney and former circuit and appellate judge based in Petersburg, emailed members of the Legislative Ethics Commission to say she plans to leave Dec. 15. Pope’s term normally would be up in June 2023. Before Pope, the General Assembly went four years without a permanent inspector general. “The last legislative session demonstrated true ethics reform is not a priority,” Pope said, despite ethics reform legislation that overwhelmingly passed this year and was praised by Democrats and Republicans as a good first step. Pope, in her letter, said the legislative inspector general “has no real power to effect change or shine a light on ethics violations.” She said the position “is essentially a paper tiger.” Pope, a Republican and Melrose Park native who became legislative inspector general in March 2019, said the position needs more independence to be effective.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Less than one-third of elementary and middle school students recorded passing scores on the latest round of state standardized tests, results released Wednesday show, confirming education officials’ concerns that the coronavirus pandemic has fueled substantial learning losses. The Indiana Department of Education released results from the spring ILEARN exam that show 40.5% of students at or above proficiency standards in English/language arts and 36.9% at or above proficiency standards in mathematics. Only 28.6% of students statewide in grades three through eight tested as proficient in both English and math, a drop from 37.1% the last time the test was administered in 2019. State data showed “significant” gaps persist among racial, ethnic and socioeconomic student groups. For example, just 8% of Black students passed both the English and math sections, compared with 46.5% of Asian students, 34.7% of white students and 15.6% of Hispanic students. Indianapolis Public Schools, which has one of the highest proportions of disadvantaged students in the state, saw only 10% of its students pass both English and math. Neighboring Warren Township schools reported less than 8% of students tested proficient. In northern Indiana’s South Bend Community Schools, 7.5% of students had passing rates on both sections of the exam.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 20% more Iowans died of drug overdoses in 2020 than in the previous year, as the powerful narcotic fentanyl became more prevalent, and the COVID-19 pandemic compounded people’s anxiety and isolated them from addiction treatment services. A new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Iowa suffered 419 drug overdose deaths last year, compared to 350 in 2019. Most neighboring states saw steeper increases in overdose deaths than Iowa did, although South Dakota was one of just two states in the country that recorded a decrease. “I think it really reflects how difficult the pandemic has been on people,” said Alison Lynch, a psychiatrist and family practice physician who runs the University of Iowa’s Addiction and Recovery Collaborative. “It’s shocking.” Lynch said in an interview that the pandemic sparked or worsened struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. Social isolation, economic stress and fears of catching COVID-19 often prompted people to drink alcohol or use drugs. And many people who had been in recovery from addictions lost the crucial support of in-person group sessions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A racial justice panel appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has recommended expanding Medicaid, adding another income tax bracket for top-income earners, restoring a food sales tax rebate, and banning Native American mascots and team names in public schools. The 15-member Commission on Racial Justice and Equity created the recommendations after meeting with Kansas Department of Commerce officials, Kansas Department of Health and Environment staff and others, according to the report. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly established the commission last year in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The report comes months after the panel crafted recommendations primarily focused on policing. Some advocates in Kansas have pushed for Medicaid expansion for a decade. Kelly promised this year to continue to push to expand Medicaid in Kansas, despite top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature opposing it. The panel wants to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level and cited an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that about 82,000 uninsured non-elderly adults in the state would become eligible for coverage if Kansas expanded its Medicaid program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Concerns about cybersecurity have led the state to extend its search for a company to modernize its pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Wednesday. The need for additional safeguards against hackers means the state will go through a rebidding process, said Jill Midkiff, a spokeswoman for the state Finance and Administration Cabinet. In doing so, the state will request enhanced security measures to protect the personal and financial information of jobless claimants, she said. The state is seeking a contract partner to overhaul its outdated technology for processing jobless claims. That search began about 16 months ago, and lawmakers were told last month that the state was in the “latter stages” of selecting a company to revamp the claims-processing system. But the need to provide enhanced cybersecurity forced the state to cancel the prior solicitation and rebid the contract, Midkiff said Wednesday. “The procurement was out for bid when Kentucky and most other states were targeted by one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks on our unemployment insurance system in history, which meant that significant additional elements needed to be added to ensure people’s bank accounts, and other information, could not be accessed,” Midkiff said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A policy governing the use of online social media and platforms by employees of the city unconstitutionally limits free speech, a lawsuit filed Thursday by two of the city’s library system employees claims. The Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic filed the suit on behalf of two employees of the city’s library system. One, Andrew Okun, is identified as a writer and editor “engaged in substantial online communications.” The other is Erin Wilson, who the suit says has a strong online presence and “engages in online humor and social commentary about the transgender experience and challenges gender stereotypes on multiple social media platforms.” Both reluctantly signed documents outlining the policies as a requirement of employment, according to the lawsuit, which focuses on a policy memo adopted last year that says employees can face discipline, including firing, for violations. Language deemed vulgar or offensive is off limits, according to the policy. It also instructs employees not to “engage or respond to negative or disparaging posts about city departments, employees or policies.” It specifically mentions a host of online sites where social comment can be made, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Slack, gaming sites and news websites.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to study the burden student loan debt has on college graduates. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill designed to study the impact of the debt. Democratic Sen. Mattie Daughtry, of Brunswick, proposed the legislation, which reinstates the state’s Commission to Study College Affordability and College Completion. Daughtry said Wednesday that the state needs to “make sure we understand how the cost of education, and the burden of student loans that come with it, is impacting Maine workers and our economy.” Daughtry cited that student loan debt in America is about $1.7 trillion, which is higher than the nation’s credit card debt. Maine’s average student loan borrower has more than $33,000 in school loans, Daughtry said. The senator said that is the sixth-highest average in the country. The commission is slated to provide a report to the Maine Legislature by January.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A jury on Thursday found the gunman who killed five people at a newspaper criminally responsible for his actions, rejecting defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments. The jury needed less than two hours to find that Jarrod Ramos could understand the criminality of his actions and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when he attacked the Capital Gazette newsroom in 2018. The verdict means Ramos, 41, will be sentenced to prison, not a maximum-security mental health facility, for one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in the U.S. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole. Survivors and family members of victims, some with tears in their eyes, embraced outside the courtroom and applauded prosecutors and jurors as they walked by after the verdict. “Having this going on for three years, it’s been a never-ending nightmare,” said Cindi Rittenour, the sister of Rebecca Smith, who died in the attack. “And then hearing that today – just all my anxiety over it, all the wonderings, the unknowns, it’s all gone away now, and all I feel is just relief and happiness. I feel like my sister can finally start to rest in peace.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston School Committee has unanimously approved an overhaul of the way students are selected for admission to the city’s elite public schools based on grades, an entrance exam and socioeconomic status. “We have come to a place where we are ready to move this district forward,” committee Chair Jeri Robinson said at Wednesday’s meeting. Under the new system, students will receive a composite score based on an admissions test and grades, then invitations to Boston Latin School, Boston Latin Academy and O’Bryant School of Math and Science will go out based on rank within eight socioeconomic tiers. Each tier will be allocated about the same number of places. The plan was opposed by some parent groups that wanted 20% of the spots at the schools set aside for the best applicants regardless of socioeconomic status. Superintendent Brenda Cassellius said she supported the change because it is easy to understand, maintains academic rigor and increases opportunity for disadvantaged students. “What is being considered tonight I believe to be a huge step forward for our students, especially our students who have not been able to access our exam schools through no fault of their own,” Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told the committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Canadian government has rejected a creative plan to have Ontario residents line up inside a U.S. border tunnel to tap into a surplus of COVID-19 vaccine held by Michigan, a mayor said. A white stripe was painted inside the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in the Detroit River. Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens proposed that Canadians would stand along the border while health care workers jab them. “We’re not trying to send a man to the moon here. We’re using the infrastructure to accomplish a shared goal,” Dilkens said. “This is a sensible, reasonable alternative to vaccines heading to the landfill.” Motor vehicle travel between the countries is prohibited during the pandemic except for commercial truck traffic and workers deemed essential. Dilkens said partnering with Michigan, which has a vaccine surplus, would reduce the waiting time for Canadians who need a second shot. But the Canada Border Services Agency told Dilkens that the tunnel clinic could disrupt travel and carry “significant security implications.” Separately, Public Health Agency of Canada warned there could be trouble if the person giving the shot reached across the tunnel’s white line into Canada. More than 500,000 vaccine doses held by Michigan are set to expire by early August, said Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman at the state health department.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order aimed at banning so-called conversion therapy Thursday but said it’s just a start and called on the Legislature to make it permanent. Minnesota is now one of about 24 states that, to varying degrees, ban mental health professionals from seeking to change a person’s sexual orientation. Eleven Minnesota cities already have local bans, including Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Duluth. Walz said conversion therapy is a “byzantine, tortuous practice” that’s not supported by any legitimate mental health organization. He said his order empowers state agencies to ensure that no Minnesotans under age 18 are subjected to it and that insurance companies don’t cover it. “There’s no place for hate in this state; there’s no room for division,” Walz said. “Our LGBTQ+ community is part, and a huge part, of what it means to be one Minnesota. When they are hurt or put through this, we all hurt. And when they succeed, we all succeed.” Attempts to get a ban through the divided Legislature failed in 2019. Sen. Scott Dibble, D-Minneapolis, said legislation is necessary to ensure a future governor doesn’t repeal the ban and to extend it to all Minnesotans. The Minnesota Family Council called the order an attack on the constitutional rights of patients, families and therapists.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has ordered that an independent monitor be put into place to oversee the state’s embattled mental health care system. The monitor will be tasked with verifying data submitted by the state analyzing the success of its mental health services. A key measure will be whether it’s preventing unnecessary hospitalizations by allowing people to be treated in their communities. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled on a remedial plan for the Mississippi State Department of Mental Health late Wednesday. The order comes 10 years after the federal government issued a letter in 2011 saying Mississippi had done too little to provide mental health services outside mental hospitals. The Justice Department sued the state in 2016, and Reeves ruled Mississippi was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Federal attorneys said during a 2019 trial that mentally ill people were being held in jails because crisis teams did not respond. They said people had been forced to live far from their families because mental health services were not available in their hometowns. They also said people made repeat trips to Mississippi mental hospitals because there was no effective planning for them to make a transition to community services, and the most intensive kinds of services were not being made available.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported the highest daily count of new COVID-19 cases since the dead of winter, and the association representing the state’s hospitals is warning that the health care system is potentially on the brink of a crisis. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services cited 2,302 newly confirmed coronavirus cases, the largest one-day count since mid-January, as the delta variant continues to spread in a state with one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. Hospitalizations ticked up statewide by 47 to 1,331, as did the number of patients in intensive care units, rising by 19 to 409. Nearly half of the ICU patients – 196 – are hospitalized in southwestern Missouri. Greene County and Springfield leaders are asking the state to fund an alternative care site since hospitals in Springfield are near capacity. The Missouri Hospital Association, in its weekly COVID-19 update, called the situation in southwestern Missouri “dire” and said signals for the rest of Missouri are “foreboding.” Mercy Springfield was reporting pandemic-high numbers of hospitalizations. Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Parson suggested Tuesday that some of that area’s health officials are trying to find someone to blame and want to scare people into getting vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s watercraft inspectors have intercepted a record number of boats carrying aquatic invasive mussels this year with nearly half of the boating season remaining, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said. Inspectors identified two infested boats last week, bringing this year’s total to 41, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The previous record was 35 boats intercepted last year. The number of inspections has remained about the same, officials said. Aquatic mussels have no natural predators and can clog water pipes and displace native species. All watercraft including non-motorized boats must be inspected when coming into Montana to prevent zebra and quagga mussels from becoming established in the state. Adult mussels can attach themselves to the bottom of boats and survive out of water for up to 30 days. Mussel larvae are microscopic and can float undetected in boat live wells, bilges and ballast tanks. Thomas Woolf, the state’s Aquatic Invasive Species Bureau chief, said there’s some continued increase in outdoor recreation due to COVID-19, and Montana residents have been buying boats in the Midwest, where mussels are established. “We’re also seeing people moving here bringing their boats,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two weeks after the state quit publicly reporting daily coronavirus statistics, Nebraska launched a new website Wednesday to provide weekly updates on some of the information. The state’s decision to stop providing daily COVID-19 updates was widely criticized by health experts who use the data to track the virus’s spread. “I don’t think that was a well-timed decision,” said Dr. James Lawler, one of the leaders of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. “I think that if you are trying to drive down a rivet at night in the rain, blindfolding yourself is probably not the best idea.” Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Olga Dack said the state’s new website will be updated on Wednesdays with some of the latest information about the virus’s spread. The site includes the number of virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the state along with statistics on the vaccination campaign, but it doesn’t include as much detail as the previous version of the dashboard. Dack said part of the problem is that much of the data the state had been reporting previously is covered by state and federal health privacy laws, which were suspended as long as the state’s official virus emergency continued, but that ended June 30.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office has been offering a “second chance” to motorists registered as organ donors by issuing a warning ticket as opposed to a fine for minor traffic violations. The Second Chance Organ Donation Awareness program was implemented this week through Friday because Wednesday marked the two-year anniversary of the death of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Hammond, a 9-year-old girl from Reno who saved three kids’ lives through the donation of her organs. At the discretion of the individual WCSO deputy, warning tickets are being handed out that note whether the offending motorist is an organ donor and give information about Donor Network West, the organization partnering with WCSO for the awareness campaign. “Through minor traffic infractions, we’ll pull people over and look at their card, and if their driver’s license indicates that they’re an organ donor, we thank them and then give them a second chance,” Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said. “Because they’ve taken that opportunity to give somebody else a second chance at life.” Balaam clarified that the program is for minor traffic infractions such as running a stop sign, minor speeding violations or not putting on a turn signal. “It’s not for your DUI or reckless driving cases,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRochester: A nonprofit has announced its plans to convert a building in the city to a drop-in youth center for young adults and children facing housing insecurity. Currently, Waypoint supports about 130 young people in the state. The nonprofit offers a variety of social services including adoption, mental health counseling and child care, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Erin Kelly, program director for Homeless Youth and Young Adult Services, said the center will be a safe place for young people to be able to drop in to receive support and resources from trained adults. The new center will also provide young people with meals, charging stations for phones, a food pantry, showers and group therapy. Kelly said the center will be officially open in 2022.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A white man captured on video yelling racist slurs at his Black neighbors and later arrested on harassment and more than a dozen other charges will remain in jail pending his trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. Edward C. Mathews, 45, of Mount Laurel, who stood silently from the Burlington County jail during a remotely held detention hearing, poses a “high risk of danger to the community,” Superior Court Judge Terrence Cook said Wednesday. Wednesday’s hearing marked the first time Mathews appeared in court on charges that stemmed from early July interactions with his neighbors at their Mount Laurel housing complex. He stood in an assembly room at the county jail during the proceedings, wearing orange and with his arms behind him. Prosecutors have charged Mathews with 14 counts, including harassment, stalking and weapons counts. Assistant Prosecutor Jamie Hutchinson on Wednesday said Mathews began harassing homeowners association board members, who were all of color, over a year ago, including by smashing windows of a neighbor’s vehicle with a rock and smearing their car with fecal matter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico spent $1.5 million to advertise the state during the Virgin Galactic space launch Sunday. The state paid the money to display New Mexico’s logo on video of the flight, KOB-TV reports. The flight saw Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson briefly rocket into space aboard the company’s winged space plane for the first time. A third of the money came from a $500,000 special appropriation by the Legislature to market and promote the state during the flight, and the rest came from the Tourism Department’s budget, department spokesman Cody Johnson said. “We actually have a conservative estimate of around $3.5 million in media value just from the event itself – and, again, that’s a pretty conservative estimate – because we’ve seen so much coverage and viewership of the livestream that it’s going to grow over the coming days and weeks,” Johnson said earlier this week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A museum dedicated to telling Chinese American history marked its reopening to the public Wednesday, with an exhibit on Asian Americans and racism that it curated partially through submissions gathered during the pandemic and a surge of anti-Asian bias incidents around the country. The opening was a long time coming for the Museum of Chinese in America, not only because of the more than yearlong pandemic shutdown but because of a fire that ravaged though the space where its collection was housed in January 2020. Luckily, most of the collection was salvaged. Looking back, there was a question of “how were we going to survive, but we kept pivoting,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the museum’s president. That included a lot of virtual programming, including the call for submissions that became part of “Responses: Asian American Voices Resisting the Tides of Racism.” The exhibition’s outer walls are a running history of sorts, a timeline showcasing the racism and bigotry that’s been turned toward Asian Americans throughout their generations in the U.S. They touch on how stereotypes connecting them and disease have a long history, along with more recent issues like the treatment of Middle Eastern and South Asian communities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the anti-Asian bias of the pandemic.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House gave its final approval to wide-ranging energy legislation during an unusual overnight session early Thursday. The chamber met briefly after midnight to complete the second of two required votes on the measure, which now heads to the Senate. The first vote happened early Wednesday evening, but Democrats unhappy with the legislation blocked an immediate second vote. House Speaker Tim Moore announced the Thursday session would begin at 12:01 a.m. because several colleagues would be unavailable to vote during the daylight hours. The bill pushed by Republican leaders would retire early several Duke Energy power plants fueled by coal and expand solar production. The measure also lets Duke Energy seek multiyear rate increases, rather than year by year, and directs the utility to find a location for a new type of nuclear power plant. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and many manufacturers are among the bill’s opponents, citing in part costs to ratepayers and the shift of authority away from the state Utilities Commission. Environmental advocates say the coal-fired plant retirements rely too much on shifting to natural gas for electricity. Thursday’s final vote of 57-49 included five Republicans who voted against the measure. Roughly a dozen House members had excused absences.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The same stronger-than-forecast oil prices that are swelling the state’s treasury also could shrink dollars for road construction next year, officials said Thursday. Oil is used for road construction and making asphalt. The state Department of Transportation already has approved 174 contracts for road, bridge and other projects this year that total $350 million, agency spokesman David Finley said. Bids on those projects came in earlier this year before oil prices began surging, he said. Bids for next year’s construction projects will begin coming in November, but most will come in spring 2022, Finley said. Steve Salwei, DOT’s director of transportation programs, said none of the state-funded projects being done this year are affected by higher crude prices. Next year, however, things may be different. “We can only construct with money we have to pay for it,” he said. Contractors appear to be ample at present, and bidding competition could lower project costs, Salwei said. The state typically is required to match 20% of federal funding used road construction, Salwei said. North Dakota’s share of the funding won’t be known until a new federal highway bill is passed, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: John Glenn’s birthplace and childhood hometown are joining forces to celebrate what would have been the history-making astronaut and U.S. senator’s 100th birthday with a three-day festival. Glenn, who died in 2016, was the first American to orbit Earth, making him a national hero in 1962. Before that, he served as a military fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War and set a transcontinental air speed record. In 1998, he became the oldest person ever to go into space at 77. He spent 24 years as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate. Running Friday through Sunday, the John Glenn Centennial Celebration is a collaboration between Cambridge, where Glenn was born July 18, 1921, and nearby New Concord, where he grew up and met his late wife, Annie, who died last year at 100 of complications from COVID-19. The celebration will include a Friendship 7-Miler race between the two communities and a Friendship 7 parade, both named for the aircraft Glenn rode during his famous orbit. Also planned are a presentation by space shuttle astronaut and fellow Ohioan Don Thomas, rocket car rides, space movies, and rides in the type of biplane a young Glenn flew over Cambridge to become hooked on aviation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials notified the Oklahoma County Detention Center on Tuesday that all juvenile inmates must be removed from the jail by Friday after a surprise inspection found numerous deficiencies at the problem-plagued jail. The Oklahoma State Department of Health notified the jail of numerous violations in a 61-page report from the June 23 inspection, including inadequate screenings of incoming inmates, failure to conduct proper inmate counts and obscured windows on cell doors that prevented proper “sight checks.” Jail administrator Greg Williams acknowledged in a statement that more improvements were needed but said he does not agree with all the report’s findings. “Decades of physical plant neglect and poor construction cannot be overcome in a few months,” Williams said. Only one current jail inmate meets the state’s definition of a juvenile, he said, and that person was expected to be transferred to the Oklahoma County juvenile detention facility before Friday’s deadline. Jail operations were taken over last July by a trust, which has drawn criticism for inmate deaths, escapes, assaults, and a hostage situation in which an inmate was fatally shot by police after beating and stabbing a jailer.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 50 years after the Macleay landfill closed, Marion County is considering turning the rolling field on top of it into a park. The county is gathering public input and fielding ideas about what the land 7 miles southeast of downtown could become. So far, contenders include a bike park, a disc golf course or maybe both. “It is beautiful,” said Tom Kissinger, program supervisor of Marion County. “On a clear day, you can see Mount Adams and Mount Hood, even Mount St. Helens.” Some neighbors are less enthusiastic about the idea, however. Discussions began after the county sold Auburn Park to Salem-Keizer Public Schools in 2019 for an expansion of the adjacent Auburn Elementary School. The 4.37-acre Auburn Park was bought in two parcels with Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars in 1977 and 1979. By law, any sale of LWCF land must be balanced by the acquisition of another park of equal or greater economic and recreational value. That’s when “the idea came up of using the old Macleay landfill” for a park, Kissinger said. But multiple commenters on the county’s Facebook post about the land expressed concerns about contamination from the landfill and said they foresee an increase in the problem of people using the vacant land for camping and waste-dumping.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Six of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities will be consolidated into two new institutions under a unanimous vote Wednesday by the State System of Higher Education’s governing board. Bloomsburg, Mansfield and Lock Haven universities in northern Pennsylvania will form one institution and California, Clarion and Edinboro universities in western Pennsylvania the other. The change will be phased in, starting later in 2022. They will have new names that have not been selected, but the plan is to keep all six campuses open with their own identities and brands, including existing sports teams. Both new institutions will have their own presidents and top administrators. The university system wants to cut student costs by 25% by getting them to graduate more quickly, enrolling high school students, raising more money from donors and grants, and expanding federal work-study offerings. There are 94,000 students in PASSHE, as it’s known, and enrollment has fallen by more than 20% since 2010. Chancellor Daniel Greenstein said students enrolled in the affected universities will be able to finish their degrees, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In-person instruction and residences on campus will remain.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: The only home on a small island in Narragansett Bay has been sold. The 600-square-foot, off-the-electrical-grid cottage on Patience Island – with the unique address of 0 Patience Way – sold for $365,000, according to public records, lower than the $399,900 asking price when it was first listed in April. Realtor Michael Russo announced the sale on his Facebook page Tuesday. “Congrats to all parties involved with this special sale!” he wrote. He did not disclose the buyer, and the sale had not been recorded in town property records. The seasonal cottage comes with just under a half-acre of land, two bedrooms, a kitchenette, a half-bath and what is described as a “picturesque front porch.” Even though it’s off the grid, a single solar panel provides some electrical services. The island, officially part of the town of Portsmouth, covers about one-third of a square mile. According to property records, the cottage was built in 1972 and had been owned by the same family since.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina’s president has indicated he does not plan to ask the Legislature for permission to change the names of nearly a dozen campus buildings that a special committee says honors racists and Civil War figures. Instead, interim university President Harris Pastides said he will encourage school leaders to concentrate on honoring deserving people on new buildings with the same committee suggesting a number of prominent Black leaders. The police killing of George Floyd in May 2020 led to the removal of building names and statues to racists and Confederates across the South. None of that happened in South Carolina because of a law called the Heritage Act passed in 2000 that requires a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly to change the name of any building based on a historical figure. In the past 21 years, lawmakers have not even taken a vote on any request from the Civil War or segregation eras. The University of South Carolina has a special committee that has been studying building names across campus for two years. It found 11 that members felt were named for racists, including a health center named for U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, who died in 2003 and started his political career fighting against people who wanted to end segregation, according to a draft report obtained by The State newspaper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday fired the warden and deputy warden of the state penitentiary, following an investigation into an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees. The governor had suspended Darin Young, the former warden, on Tuesday, along with Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt. Noem said Thursday that she has also suspended Stefany Bawek, who was the director of a prison work program called Pheasantland Industries. The anonymous complaint released by Noem’s office alleges that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says that schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could “work in the same vicinities as their interest/victims” and that employees who did not give in to the harassment were made to “suffer by being placed in less desirable posts.” The complaint further alleges that employee morale was low amid wages that lagged other industries, that corrections officers did not have body armor that was “up to standards,” and that promotions were based on personal connections. Nome’s statement said the investigation into the complaint is continuing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s former top vaccination official received a dog muzzle in the mail a few days before she was fired this week in what she has said was an attempt to use her as a scapegoat to appease lawmakers. “Someone wanted to send a message to tell her to stop talking,” said Brad Fiscus, the husband of Dr. Michelle Fiscus. “They thought it would be a threat to her.” Michelle Fiscus had been facing harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers over the Tennessee Health Department’s outreach efforts to vaccinate teenagers against COVID-19. At a June legislative session, in which some lawmakers threatened to defund the Health Department, they specifically referenced a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers explaining the legality of allowing them to inoculate children 14 and up without parental consent. Fiscus was fired Monday. Her termination letter does not explain the reasoning for her dismissal, and a Health Department spokesperson has declined to comment on it. Brad Fiscus said his wife received a box in Amazon packaging containing a black dog muzzle at her office about a week before she was fired. But he said Michelle Fiscus was “taking it in stride” and continuing to “speak truth.” “She said, ‘Whoever sent that must not know me very well. That’s for a beagle, but I’m a pit bull,’ ” Brad Fiscus recalled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Early in the pandemic, the Design Institute for Health, a joint program from Dell Medical School and the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the best way long-term care centers could help staffers follow sanitation guidelines. The institute’s team looked at creating clear signage about personal protective equipment, for example, and how to design stations for putting on that equipment and sanitizing hands. One finding of that initial study, paid for by a $410,822 grant from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, was that the effectiveness of infection control was directly related to the satisfaction of the workforce in the long-term care centers. The Design Institute for Health now is running three new pilot programs at three local long-term care centers, all of which participated in the previous study. The city of Austin and Austin Public Health are funding the $90,000 project, which began Monday. The first pilot program tries different design strategies to make the physical environment better for the staff and create spaces for breaks. Traditional breakrooms have been closed to staff during the pandemic. The second pilot program looks at what resources and partnerships can be created to help people working in long-term care centers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought and COVID-19 pandemic have combined to make for a difficult year for agriculture, but the state’s farmers are finding ways to make the most of it. Utah farmers created a statewide food distribution program last year aiming to get food to hungry residents and their families, and managers announced this week that the “Miracle Projects” administered via the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation had helped serve more than 1.5 million pounds of food to more than 35,000 hungry people statewide. At the same time, farmers and ranchers were looking for additional ways to get their food products directly to consumers. Now, members of the Utah Farm Bureau are pushing to find new ways to fund the program and keep it going while still supporting area farmers and ranchers. Farmers Feeding Utah Inc., established to make buying local products convenient and reasonable, kicked off recently with a Utah-product-only subscription box that delivers new products to people’s doorsteps every month.

Dozens of desperate travelers from throughout the Northeast had been traveling to the St. Albans office after getting word that people could get passports on the spot and struggling to make appointments at other offices. The Vermont Passport Agency had been offering appointment slots from no-shows to last-minute customers on its premises, the State Department said in a statement Thursday. The agency has “discontinued this practice due to unintended safety and security consequences,” it said. More than 20 people, including small children, were waiting outside the Vermont office Thursday despite the policy change. On Wednesday, the State Department said the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing, because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the State Department is accepting appointments at the Vermont Passport Agency and other public passport agencies for life-or-death emergencies. A limited number of appointments for urgent, non-life-or-death travel within 72 hours can be made online.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After a pandemic-enforced hiatus in 2020, a popular summer event is making a comeback. While COVID-19 restrictions forced the cancellations of the island’s biggest event – the Chincoteague Pony Penning held each year in July – a small event that still attracts hundreds each year during that same time period is returning. From July 22 to 24, blueberry aficionados can sample the juicy berry in a wide variety of creations while browsing through arts and crafts at what is billed as the “largest fine arts and crafts event on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.” The 33rd annual Blueberry Festival promises plenty of blueberry treats for attendees, along with live entertainment and both indoor and outdoor exhibits featuring artists and crafters from the Shore and beyond. The festival will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day at the Chincoteague Center. In addition to popular blueberry=themed foods such as ice cream, pie and cakes, four food vendors will be on hand, offering options including pizza, seafood, and Middle Eastern and Mexican specialties. Live music will be offered throughout the three days of the festival, featuring popular returning and new acts.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian police watchdog group has found that an officer repeatedly worked over 90 hours a week and earned so much overtime that he was the highest-paid city employee one year at more than $400,000 – and none of his supervisors noticed. The review by Seattle’s Office of Police Accountability of the case of Officer Ron Willis found 15 times in which he worked more than 90 hours a week in 2019 and identified numerous gaps in the Seattle Police Department’s ability to monitor overtime, The Seattle Times reports. In a letter to interim Chief Adrian Diaz, OPA director Andrew Myerberg urged the police department to track hours in a centralized database or require the department’s human resources staff to “flag employees who may be working excess hours.” As a result of the review, Willis was suspended for one day without pay for working more than the maximum hours allowed by department rules. A police spokesperson said Willis wasn’t available for comment, and efforts to reach him by the newspaper weren’t successful. The police department has long struggled to monitor overtime and has been the subject of multiple critical findings from city auditors and the oversight group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Gov. Jim Justice visited Thomas Jackson’s office at West Virginia University’s Robotic Technology Center in Fairmont on Wednesday to present the latest million-dollar prize in the state’s vaccination sweepstakes, according to a news release. Justice was accompanied by his pet English bulldog – Babydog – who is the mascot of the “Do It for Babydog” vaccination sweepstakes. The Republican governor also surprised two residents with brand-new, custom-outfitted trucks and two more with four-year scholarships to any public institution in the state. Other West Virginians won lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, custom hunting rifles, custom hunting shotguns, and weekend getaways to West Virginia state parks. Earlier in the week, Justice confronted outlandish conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines and set higher targets for vaccinating residents age 50 and older. He said at a news conference Tuesday that he recently had a meal with a group of people who believed in the baseless conspiracy theory that “there was something in the vaccine that would enable the federal government to track us.” The governor dismissed it and urged more people to get their shots. “It’s just a stretch beyond what I can believe,” he said. Justice noted that the phones people carry around with them have more tracking potential.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Gov. Tony Evers joined local and state economic leaders in the city Wednesday to announce that he will direct $130million in federal funding toward workforce development programs. The funds, which come from the state’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation, will be spread across three programs that will help regions find solutions to workforce challenges and help unemployed or underemployed workers find job opportunities. The Democratic governor said there is “no one-size-fits all-solution” to workforce challenges. “I’ve heard from many Wisconsin business owners, employers, out-of-work job-seekers that while employment in Wisconsin continues to grow, our economy is facing obviously a workforce shortage. A shortage that existed well before I became governor but has been made worse obviously by this pandemic,” Evers said. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate in May 2021 – the most recent month reported by the state – was 3.9%, tied for the 10th-lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largest block of funding will provide grants to at least 10 local and regional entities with about $10 million each to help meet needs including child care, transportation and housing. Evers said that funding would go out sometime in the fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A magician and comic has canceled performances at libraries in northeastern Wyoming because of threats over a social media post about her being a transgender woman, she said. The Campbell County Library posted on its Facebook page that Mikayla Oz, 24, was canceling shows planned for Wednesday and Thursday in Gillette and Wright out of safety concerns for herself, library staff and patrons, the Gillette News Record reports. The fact that Oz is a transgender woman was shared on a social media post, leading to misinformation about her performances and calls to protest the events, library officials said. Oz, from Des Moines, Iowa, has performed at libraries, schools and other events. She said the show she planned is family-friendly and doesn’t have an LGBTQ message. She was initially willing to do her show despite some complaints, but then she started receiving violent and frightening threats online and by telephone, she said. Library director Terri Lesley said her staff also received threats from a patron. Oz’s gender identity was not previously known to library staff, nor is it something they consider relevant, Lesley said. “It just breaks my heart, especially when my show has absolutely nothing to do with my back story at all,” Oz said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/03/deity-purgatory-virgin-snake-birth-slug-dough-traps-news-around-states/118529798/", "title": "'Deity' in Purgatory, virgin snake birth: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Jordan-Hare Stadium will officially be at full capacity for Auburn football games in 2021, the university said in a release outlining what game days will look like this year. Face coverings are recommended but not required in open-air spaces, the release said. However, the university requires masks in indoor spaces, so fans using elevators, premium indoor seating or transit buses will need to bring them. While some schools such as LSU are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for stadium entry, Auburn is not. Tiger Walk will be back, but the team’s pregame procession into the stadium will be shortened. The traditional pregame war eagle flight is also returning this year. The marching band will be allowed on the field for pregame and halftime festivities after being prohibited from the field last season. The university is encouraging fans to use digital ticketing through mobile devices. Merchandising and concessions inside Jordan-Hare will be cashless and contact-free, but game programs will still sell in and around the stadium for $10 cash.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Plastic is no longer a choice when checking out from stores in Anchorage. A ban on plastic bags is back in force in Alaska’s largest city after a temporary suspension during the pandemic, Alaska’s News Source reports. As of Wednesday, the option when checking out is paper or reusable options. The ban first took effect in 2019, but Assembly member Felix Rivera said it was relaxed during the pandemic in part because the supply chain for paper bags was disrupted. There were also concerns about whether reusable bags could transmit the coronavirus, he said. “I think since last year, we’ve learned a lot about the virus, and now nothing that I am reading leads me to have a lot of concern about reusable bags transmitting the virus,” he told the Anchorage television station.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a process that some people call a “virgin birth,” a Brazilian rainbow boa was born at the Phoenix Zoo with DNA from only one parent. Its mom, who has been at the zoo for 10 years, has never been paired for mating. Imagine the keepers’ surprise when the baby boa was discovered in the snake’s enclosure Aug. 3. The snake was likely born through parthenogenesis, in which one – or multiple – eggs mature without fertilization. The zoo believes this is the second documented birth of its kind among Brazilian rainbow boas. Mom is currently in the Boa Hut on the Forest of Uco Trail, and the zoo plans to house the baby in a reptile nursery on the Children’s Trail. So-called virgin births, or asexual reproduction, may not be that uncommon among vertebrates. Thelma, a reticulated python at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, gave birth to six baby pythons without a partner in 2014. “Once considered an evolutionary novelty, facultative parthenogenesis has now been documented in an increasing number of vertebrate species, ranging from the hammerhead shark to domestic turkeys, komodo dragons to snakes,” Warren Booth, an associate professor of molecular ecology at the University of Tulsa who studies the phenomenon, said in a statement in 2016.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several inmates say they weren’t told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used for that purpose. Three inmates at the Washington County jail said they didn’t know they were being given ivermectin until its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said it’s heard similar complaints from inmates. The inmates’ comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail’s physician that use of the drug was voluntary. “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for the virus. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients. Edrick Floreal-Wooten said he was given ivermectin after testing positive Aug. 21. “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” Floreal-Wooten said. He said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates. “Never. I’m not livestock,” he said. “I’m a human.” The ACLU said it has also heard from inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon force large department stores to display some child products in gender-neutral ways after the Legislature passed a bill Wednesday aimed at getting rid of traditional pink and blue marketing schemes for items like toys and toothbrushes. The bill would not outlaw boys and girls sections in department stores but would require retailers to have a gender-neutral section to display “a reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” It would only apply to department stores with 500 or more employees, so most small businesses would be exempt. It also wouldn’t apply to clothes, just toys and “childcare items,” which include hygiene and teething products. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly for a procedural vote before it heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. If it becomes law, California would become the first state to require these sections in stores, according to the office of Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, the bill’s author. He said the measure was inspired by a 10-year-old whose mother works in his legislative office. “Britten asked her mom while shopping why certain things in a store were ‘off limits’ to her because she was a girl but would be fine if she was a boy,” Low said. “Thankfully, my colleagues recognized the pure intentions of this bill and the need to let kids be kids.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three suburban police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter that provoked national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. The grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Phil Weiser are the latest chapter for the police department in the city of Aurora, which has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. McClain’s death helped inspire a sweeping police accountability law in Colorado, a ban on chokeholds and restrictions on the use of the sedative ketamine, both of which the indictment alleges contributed to his death. The charges were announced days after the second anniversary of when police stopped McClain on the street after a 911 caller reported a man who seemed “sketchy.” “What I set out to do is still not over, but I’m halfway there. I’m halfway there,” McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, said of her efforts to hold police accountable. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over last year and has pledged to work to restore public trust, said the department will continue to cooperate with the judicial process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: A small jet crashed shortly after taking off from a small airport Thursday morning, killing all four people aboard, officials said. The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the building has been accounted for, and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said. Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida overnight, officials said the city was seeing historic flooding Thursday. The Wilmington Fire Department and other agencies were performing water rescues, and many streets and bridges remained closed, officials said. Flooding affected several neighborhoods, and a Wilmington Fire Department spokesperson said crews had rescued 60 to 80 people by noon. Delaware Department of Transportation Community Relations Director CR McLeod said the flooding was affecting homes and businesses, and there were many vehicles underwater, WDEL-FM reports. More than 50 bridges would need to be surveyed and assessed, he said. “A lot of this water is coming down from Pennsylvania with the excessive amounts of rain that they had associated with the storm yesterday,” McLeod said. “All that water is going to make its way down toward the Delaware River, and it’s all coming down the Brandywine.” The Brandywine entered a major flood stage Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it reached a maximum crest of 23.1 feet, a new record, according to the National Weather Service. Waters began to recede, and the creek was expected to fall below flood stage early Friday, according to the agency.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital ranks last in the country for teacher pay compared to other jobs, WUSA-TV reports, citing a study from business.org. The July study compared the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers to the average salary for all jobs within each state and the district. The data was collected using the National Center for Education Statistics and compared with the salaries of all occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results found that D.C. and Virginia rank last in the country, with educators earning 17% and 10% less than the average wage, respectively. Virginia and D.C. are among seven states that the study claims pay teachers below the state’s average salary. The study reports that Mississippi has the lowest salary for teachers at just more than $45,000 per year, but that is still 8.6% higher than the average salary in the state. Pennsylvania ranked highest in the country, according to the study, with teachers earning 30% more than the average wage.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An elementary school was placed in a temporary, limited lockdown after a parent threatened to leave his job and confront an assistant principal for telling his children they couldn’t come to school without being masked. Christopher Kivlin was met by police officers Tuesday outside Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota. No charges were filed, but he was ordered not to come back to the school without calling first and getting permission. An incident report said Kivlin showed up to campus saying the school was violating the law by not allowing his children to attend school. The Sarasota County school district is among a dozen of Florida’s 67 districts, representing about half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students, that have defied Gov. Rob DeSantis’ executive order barring schools from requiring masks over parent objections. A judge last week ruled that DeSantis did not have the authority to issue the order. The DeSantis administration is expected to appeal the decision. Kivlin told television station WFLA he had no intention of hurting anyone but just wanted to talk to a school official. He apologized for scaring anyone and said that “it was just emotions built up.” “I found out after the fact that the school had to go into lockdown, I was like, ‘That’s horrible,’ ” Kivlin said. “I feel like I might have scared other parents.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge’s decision striking down a Trump-era rule that eliminated federal protections for some wetlands and streams is giving hope to opponents of a proposed mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge in southeast Georgia. A federal judge in Arizona on Monday tossed the rule that narrowed the types of U.S. waters that qualify for federal protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. The judge’s order, which applies nationwide, says the rule enacted under former President Donald Trump improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. One high-profile project directly affected by the environmental rollbacks under Trump was a proposal by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals to mine titanium dioxide on land about 3 miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge near the Georgia-Florida line. Conservationists fear mining close to the swamp’s edge could cause irreparable harm to the largest federal wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. Yet the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the project no longer required a federal permit because the rollbacks under Trump excluded wetlands on the site from federal protection. That left sole authority to Georgia state regulators to decide whether it could move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tourism officials have released a plan to reduce visitors on Oahu, the state’s most frequently visited and populous island. The plan was approved by the Hawaii Tourism Authority in July, and the full plan has now been released to the public, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Decreasing the total number of visitors to Oahu to a manageable level by controlling the number of visitor accommodations and exploring changes to land use, zoning and airport policies,” the plan says. It also establishes a regenerative tourism fee, creates reservation systems for natural and cultural sites, manages visitors’ use of cars, and promotes consumption of locally produced and sold goods. “We appreciate the Oahu residents who participated in the (plan) process and passionately contributed their diverse viewpoints, discussed various tourism-related challenges in their neighborhoods and helped set forth an actionable plan that is necessary for the community’s well-being,” said John De Fries, the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s president and CEO. “It’s about continued collaboration and moving forward together to malama (care for) this cherished place and each other, as desired by the people of Oahu.” The three-year plan was developed by community members and county officials in collaboration with the tourism authority.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: At least two state lawmakers received threatening letters concerning their votes on a law intended to drastically reduce wolf numbers. The anonymous letters to Republican Sen. Dan Johnson and Republican Rep. Caroline Troy say that “just as the wolf went from predator to prey, so shall you.” It’s not clear how many more lawmakers received the letters. The Lewiston Tribune reports some of the lawmakers contacted the Idaho State Police. Backers of the wolf law that took effect July 1 said the state can cut the number of wolves to 150 before federal authorities would take over management. That would be a 90% reduction of the state’s 1,500 wolves. The letters describe lawmakers as “nothing more than a sellout to the Cattle Association and that pitiful minority of cattle producers that seemingly dictate how our wildlife lives and dies.” Johnson said the envelope had a Sacramento postmark, and the return address was the Statehouse in Boise. “It’s OK for people to disagree with my votes or my bills, but some comments cross the line,” he said. “I think this letter comes close to the line, if not stepping over it.” The law passed the Senate 26-7 with no support from Democrats. It passed the House 58-11 with one Democrat in support and no Republicans opposed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Rowers, kayakers and other users of the Chicago River are getting a real-time look at one measure of water quality in the system that weaves through downtown and several neighborhoods. Chicago nonprofit Current installed three sensors in the river’s three main branches in 2019 to continuously estimate the amount of bacteria from human and other warm-blooded animals’ waste. The organization initially planned to begin making the real-time results public in 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic delayed its plans until Thursday, when a website updating with data taken every 15 minutes went online. The city’s development in the 19th century was thanks to the river – truly a system of rivers and manmade canals – that provided a path between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system. While the meatpacking and lumber industries could use it for shipping, the waterway also became a dumping ground for those and other industries and for sewage from homes and businesses. Quality of the 156-mile river system has improved in recent years, helped by multibillion-dollar construction of new reservoirs and underground tunnels. But when rain overwhelms Chicago’s sewer systems, sewage and stormwater is diverted to the river, prompting warnings to stay off the water for several days.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Schools got an incentive from the governor Wednesday to require face masks in classrooms in hopes of slowing down the number of COVID-19 outbreaks among students. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a new statewide executive order that eases quarantine requirements for students if all children and adults in the school were wearing masks throughout the day. The revised order comes as many Indiana schools have seen COVID-19 outbreaks and as the state’s vaccination rate remains stubbornly low. Holcomb said the coronavirus’ spread in Indiana was regrettable but avoidable. “To the skeptics or unbelievers or deniers, I would just plead to look at the facts, to look at the numerical data that shows we can all stay safe if you get vaccinated,” Holcomb said. Meanwhile, the state’s largest hospital system will be stopping all inpatient nonemergency surgeries as the state faces a growing surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Indiana University Health announced Thursday that the surgery suspension would start Monday. The decision comes after IU Health said last week that it was cutting such surgeries by half. IU Health, which operates 16 hospitals around the state, also said that more than 1,000 employees did not meet Wednesday’s deadline to get COVID-19 vaccinations and would be suspended immediately.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A federal judge on Thursday ordered a prominent participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to return to jail after he was caught accessing the internet to watch false conspiracy theories about the presidential election. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said Doug Jensen, 42, of Des Moines, had violated the strict conditions that were set when he was released from jail July 13, including prohibitions on accessing the internet and using a cellphone. Prosecutors had moved to revoke Jensen’s pretrial release Aug. 19, days after a federal officer found Jensen in his garage using an iPhone to watch news from Rumble, a streaming platform popular with conservatives. Jensen acknowledged that he had earlier watched two days of the cyber symposium sponsored by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who used the event to push false theories that the 2020 election’s outcome was changed by Chinese hackers. Kelly noted that he had released Jensen from jail in July after Jensen claimed he had an awakening behind bars and realized the QAnon conspiracy theory to which he adhered was a “pack of lies.” The judge said it was significant that Jensen’s violations were caught during the first unannounced visit to his home by pretrial services officers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About a third of Kansas nursing homes have less than half of their health care workers vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data released by the state. Just four of the more than 300 federally licensed nursing homes are meeting the state’s goal for 90% of health care workers vaccinated, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows. The departments released the data about a week after President Joe Biden announced that his administration will require nursing home staff to be vaccinated as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. The department for aging and disability services said in a statement last week that it released the data to prepare for those new rules. Gov. Laura Kelly’s office said in a statement, without offering details, that the administration would encourage nursing home workers to get inoculated. As of Wednesday, about 46% of Kansans were fully vaccinated, according to data provided by the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A judge has refused to grant a divorce decree to a couple who swore under oath that their marriage was irreparably broken. The reason, she said: They were too nice to each other in court. In a decision condemned by divorce lawyers, Bullitt Family Court Judge Monica Meredith at least temporarily declined to dissolve Douglas and Nicole Potts’ 13-year marriage, which both insist can’t be salvaged. In an Aug. 23 order continuing the case and suggesting the couple undergo counseling, Meredith observed they were “respectful and courteous toward one another, and both held themselves in dignified and mature composure.” Meredith, who was elected to Family Court in 2018, said that “divorce court does not typically bring that demeanor out in its participants.” But in interviews and emails, a half-dozen family lawyers said Meredith’s order was inappropriate, unlawful and ridiculous. “It sends a terrible message to litigants: You are better served by acting like a petulant child in court than by acting mature,” said Louisville attorney Hal Helmers, who wasn’t involved in the case. Louise Graham, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, said counseling may be ordered only if one side disagrees the marriage is over. “Ninety-nine percent of divorce lawyers agree with the above, and we can never agree on ANYTHING,” Helmers said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: Photos show what appears to be a miles-long oil slick near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida, according to aerial survey imagery released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reviewed by the Associated Press. The government imagery, along with additional photos taken by the AP from a helicopter Tuesday, also show Louisiana port facilities, oil refineries and shipyards in the storm’s path where the telltale rainbow sheen typical of oil and fuel spills is visible in the water of bays and bayous. Both state and federal regulators said Wednesday that they had been unable to reach the stricken area, citing challenging conditions in the disaster zone. The NOAA photos show a black slick floating in the Gulf near a large rig with the name Enterprise Offshore Drilling painted on its helipad. Aerial photos taken by NOAA on Tuesday also show significant flooding to the massive Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery along the bank of the Mississippi River, just south of New Orleans. In some sections of the refinery, rainbow sheen is visible on the water leading toward the river. Asked about reports of levee failures near the refinery Monday, Phillips 66 spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there was “some water” in the facility and stressed that operations were shut down before the storm.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Newly unionized nurses at Maine Medical Center are frustrated over the end of pandemic accommodations. The policies had let high-risk employees work outside COVID-19 care, covered COVID-19 treatment costs, provided quarantine pay for coronavirus exposure outside the workplace and allowed pregnant nurses to start paid maternity leave in the last month of their pregnancy. “In the middle of a spike in infections from a fast-moving variant, this is not the time to remove the protections that have helped both staff and patients here for the past several months,” nurse Madison Light said. The surge is causing nurses to scramble to staff the COVID-19 units. They’re not getting enough breaks, they said. “Now it feels like there is no end in sight. Nurses and caregivers are exhausted, frustrated, and stretched to their physical and emotional limits,” Light said. MaineHealth said its policies on COVID-19 exposure and pregnancy leave follow current clinical and OSHA guidelines. Accommodations for high-risk employees are considered on a case-by-case basis, the company said.\n\nMaryland\n\nThurmont: First responders in western Maryland used a boat to rescue 10 children and a driver from a school bus caught in rising floodwaters as the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon. Frederick County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Todd Wivell said the bus got stuck when it tried to cross a bridge in the Thurmont area that had water going across it, WTOP-FM reports. The driver and 10 children were rescued from the bus by boat, with the help of first responders from the sheriff’s office and the Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, he said. Even 6 inches of moving water is enough to knock a person off their feet, Wivell said. Frederick County Public Schools recalled all school buses that were in the process of dropping students off. Parents were asked to pick their kids up from school buildings. Frederick County Public Schools’ Superintendent Terry Alban apologized after facing criticism for not dismissing children early, saying the decision to remain open for a full day led to “stress and anxiety for many,” The Frederick News-Post reports. School systems in neighboring counties sent students home early ahead of forecasted inclement weather.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A question that would require voters to present an ID and a second that would grant new benefits for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft while stopping short of declaring them employees have cleared an initial hurdle on their way to next year’s ballot. Other proposed initiatives that received a constitutional green light from Attorney General Maura Healey’s office Wednesday would legalize the sale of fireworks, create a “whale safe fishing act,” allow for the return of “happy hours,” and create a “Right to Counsel Program” for those facing eviction. The questions were among 16 proposed laws and one proposed constitutional amendment that met the requirements for ballot initiatives outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution, according to Healey’s office. Another 13 proposals were deemed unconstitutional. The state constitution requires proposed initiatives be in the proper form to present to voters, not be substantially the same as any measure on the ballot in either of the two preceding statewide elections, contain only subjects related to each other and not involve topics specifically excluded from the ballot initiative process.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Thousands of Flint residents were put at potential risk because a New York law firm, for six months, used handheld X-ray devices to scan their bones for lead without first registering the devices and putting recommended safety measures in place, documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press show. Starting in about August 2020, the Napoli Shkolnik firm used the portable scanners – which are tools in the mining and scrap metal industries but are not designed for use on humans – as a way of bolstering residents’ claims for larger shares of a proposed $641.25 million settlement of civil lawsuits arising from the 2014 lead poisoning of Flint’s drinking water supply. The law firm’s failure until February 2021 to register the devices with the state of Michigan, as required by law, and the state’s low-key response once it learned the scanners had been used for months without required approvals add insult to the injury that was the Flint drinking water crisis. “Unfortunately, thousands of bone scans using these devices ... went forward under improper and illegal circumstances,” said Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician and former president and CEO of Mott’s Children’s Health Center, who first raised concerns about the scanners in a February court filing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys for three former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death asked a judge Thursday to bar their upcoming trial from being livestreamed, saying some witnesses won’t testify if the proceedings are broadcast. The request from attorneys for Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao is an about-face from their earlier request to have the trial publicly broadcast, and it is opposed by prosecutors and news outlets. Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to stand trial next March on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 2020 death. Their co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter after weeks of proceedings that marked the first time in Minnesota that a criminal trial was livestreamed in its entirety. Before Chauvin’s trial, attorneys for all four men requested the trials be broadcast, but Lane and Kueng recently backtracked, with their attorneys saying that the “worldwide publicity” from televised coverage of Chauvin’s trail “crushed” their clients’ right to a fair trial. Attorneys Earl Gray and Tom Plunkett say the public access led some witnesses to decline testifying for the defense, noting one witness in the Chauvin trial has been harassed and another faced professional scrutiny.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The U.S. Marshals Service has arrested a man in connection with an assault on an MSNBC reporter during a live broadcast from the state Monday. Benjamin Dagley was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a shopping center in Dayton, Ohio, according to a report. With the assistance of the public, the Gulfport Police Department identified Dagley, of Wooster, Ohio, as a suspect in an assault on Shaquille Brewster as he covered Hurricane Ida. Dagley allegedly pulled up in white pickup truck and ran toward the camera crew. The suspect could be heard off-camera repeatedly screaming something about reporting the hurricane accurately. Brewster attempted to go on with the live coverage, even shifting his position to move away from the suspect, but when he realized the accused was not backing down, Brewster tossed it back to the studio. As the camera faded, viewers could see Brewster being physically confronted. Gulfport police issued warrants Tuesday charging Dagley with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbance of the peace and one count of violating emergency curfew. Police also said Dagley is on probation for a previous charge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state senator from Kansas City said he is demanding answers after an exhibit on the gay rights movement in Missouri was removed from the state Capitol. Democrat Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay member of the Missouri Senate, said he was “appalled” when he was told the exhibit, “Making History: Kansas City and the Rise of Gay Rights,” had been removed from the Missouri State Museum. Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources, did not immediately reply to questions about why the exhibit was moved and who made the decision. On Tuesday, Uriah Stark, legislative aide for state Rep. Mitch Boggs, R-La Russell, posted pictures of the exhibit on Facebook and questioned why the “taxpayer funded museum is pushing the LGBT agenda in our state capitol?” The next day, Stark thanked “several of our great elected officials” for having the exhibit removed, specifically mentioning Republican Reps. Ann Kelley, of Lamar, and Brian Seitz, of Branson, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “There is NOTHING controversial about an exhibit that explains how members of the LGBT community fought to end persecution and demand rights as citizens,” Razer tweeted Thursday. “I’m extremely disappointed and angry that @mostateparks may think otherwise.”\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park is ending its reservation requirement to travel on the Going-to-the-Sun Road after Labor Day as the busy summer season winds down. The reservation system has been in place for anyone wanting to travel on the scenic highway since May 28. Reservations were required between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. The pilot program testing the reservation system worked to alleviate traffic, but park officials said some people struggled to find available tickets. The park’s shuttle service will also end after Labor Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government is stepping in to help shuffle patients between local hospitals that are dealing with a surge of people with COVID-19 and other health issues, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. The Republican governor said the state has partnered with Nomi Health, the creators of the TestNebraska program, to offer call centers that overcrowded hospitals can contact when they need to transfer patients elsewhere. The around-the-clock call centers will serve as coordinators for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed, at a cost of $200,000 a month. The announcement is another sign that the state is once again struggling with coronavirus cases, even though most of the hospitalizations are patients without the coronavirus. State officials opened a similar call center last year but ended the program after the number of cases and hospitalizations declined. The new call center is scheduled to open Saturday. Nebraska’s hospitals reported to the state Wednesday that 72% of their 3,234 beds were occupied, although some facilities were far more crowded and having to send patients to other places. Ricketts relaxed licensing restrictions for nurses last week in an attempt to fix severe staffing shortages.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. said Wednesday that a conference scheduled next month in Las Vegas by a group espousing the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon won’t be held at any Caesars property. It wasn’t immediately clear if the “Patriot Double Down” event organized by Patriot Voice would be moved, postponed or canceled. Caesars Entertainment executive Kate Whiteley confirmed a Las Vegas Review-Journal report that the Oct. 23-25 event billed as a “Great Awakening Weekend” won’t be held at the new Caesars Forum convention space near the Las Vegas Strip. With tickets from $650 to $3,000, the conference was billed to feature speakers including former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and 8kun website owner Jim Watkins. QAnon is a theory featuring the baseless belief that satanic pedophiles, child sex traffickers and cannibals are in collusion with the so-called deep state and will be uncovered at a reckoning followers call a “Great Awakening.” QAnon signs are often seen at rallies for ex-President Donald Trump, and some adherents are facing trial for roles in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The group also derides the COVID-19 pandemic as a “plandemic,” suggesting the coronavirus was manufactured and its severity exaggerated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it’s experiencing staff shortages during the coronavirus pandemic that range from nursing positions to food service workers. The health care system said Wednesday that it organized a “Managing and Staffing to Capacity” task force to identify solutions to the shortage, especially in the inpatient units and other care areas at its flagship hospital in Lebanon. Dartmouth-Hitchcock also began planning for reallocation of resources and staff. Earlier this year, it increased the starting rate for newly licensed nurses to $30 per hour and made wage adjustments for experienced clinical nurses and nurse supervisors. It plans to provide a 2% wage increase for other staff beginning in October. Joni Menard, task force leader, said that “the overall situation continues to be challenging as clinical demand increases and the supply of traveling staff is depleted across the nation.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Murphy administration officials used an unapproved encryption app at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and deleted correspondence “on at least one occasion,” according to new court records. The alleged use of the encrypted messaging application Telegram by Department of Health officials shows the limits of New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act and the ability to skirt them and other laws and rules, experts said. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy revealed that health officials were communicating on Telegram in the administration’s latest legal filing in the whistleblower lawsuit brought by Christopher Neuwirth, an assistant health commissioner who was fired shortly after first-wave peak of the coronavirus. In a 308-page response countering Neuwirth’s claim that he was improperly fired last May, Murphy’s lawyers said Neuwirth required employees who reported to him “use a non-state-approved messaging application – Telegram – furthering burdening those state employees.” The Open Public Records Act does not specifically address encrypted messages but does include emails and text messages used for official business in its definition of government records. Such records are subject to public access unless they fall under one of more than two dozen exemptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta officials say they’re canceling some parts of the event and will require guests to wear masks to enter the grounds and while in indoor areas and crowded outdoor settings to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Wednesday he didn’t believe that face mask requirements and other safety practices would affect attendance numbers for the Oct. 2-10 event. “Masks have been a way of life that we’ve all been experiencing for the past year or more, so I think it’s one of those things that people are used to,” he said. The music fiesta is being canceled this year due to close proximity of guests, and the discovery center is being shelved because of its indoor nature featuring activities with multiple touchpoints, officials said. Other steps being taken include providing cashless options to buy tickets, moving hospitality seating outdoors and increasing spacing between popular special-shape balloons inside the park, officials said. The changes track federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and the current public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Democratic-led Legislature voted Wednesday to extend an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for commercial and residential tenants who fell behind on their rent because of hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had called the Legislature to return for an “extraordinary session” to pass the legislation, which will put evictions on hold until Jan. 15. New York’s previous eviction moratorium, which included foreclosure protections for property owners, expired Tuesday. In an Aug. 12 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court nixed part of the moratorium that allowed tenants to pause eviction proceedings simply by filing a form declaring they’d had a COVID-19-related financial hardship or that moving in a pandemic would prove a health risk. The court said landlords should have the ability to challenge those hardships in court. New York is poised to change how the moratorium works in light of that ruling. Landlords will be able to challenge hardship declarations and direct judges to require tenants with hardships to apply for rental assistance. Hochul said the legislation will stand up to legal scrutiny. But the leader of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest organization of landlords in New York, vowed Wednesday to sue to block the moratorium in federal court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The majority of public school students taking standardized state exams in reading, math and science last school year failed them, data shows. State education leaders cautioned against making year-over-year comparisons with the tests taken during a school year marked by limited in-person instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 45.4% of K-12 students passed the exams for the 2020-21 school year, according to results released at a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday. Two years ago – the last time testing was required – nearly 59% of K-12 students passed state exams. The U.S. Education Department did not require states to test students in the 2019-20 school year but required it this past year to assess pandemic learning loss. Because of coronavirus safety concerns, some high school students this past year took exams months after completing the course on which they were being tested. Some tests were revised, and a lower-than-normal share of students took them, news outlets report. “While the 2018-19 data is included as a way to provide context, comparison of the two years should only be made with a recognition that multiple anomalies occurred during the 2020-21 school year and during test administration,” state board member Jill Camnitz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A lawmaker who heads the state’s anti-abortion legislative caucus said Thursday that it’s likely the Republican-led Legislature will seek to pass a measure mirroring a new Texas law that virtually bans all abortions and that the Supreme Court has allowed to remain in force. GOP Sen. Janne Myrdal, one of the Legislature’s most ardent anti-abortion lawmakers, said she “assumes” legislation will be crafted eventually that uses the Texas law as a template. “I hear people talking about it,” Myrdal said. About a third of the Legislature’s 141 members are active in the caucus, which already has successfully pushed some of the nation’s toughest abortion laws. If it is drafted, it’s unclear when it would be introduced, though it could happen when the Legislature meets later this year in a reconvened or special session meant to deal with legislative redistricting. North Dakota is one of several states that have so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Myrdal said the high court’s action – or lack thereof – offers “a glimmer of hope” the court might eventually overturn Roe v. Wade because of its shift to the right following the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief this week launched an effort to purge inactive voters from state rolls, while using the announcement to push for passage of a bill making several changes to Ohio’s election process. The four-year process for purging inactive voters targets those who have not voted for two years and whose addresses may have changed and whose voter registration must be updated to reflect the move, according to Wednesday’s directive by GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose to Ohio’s 88 county elections boards. Inactive voters can keep themselves on the rolls by voting in any election in the next four years, submitting an absentee ballot application, registering to vote or taking other election-related steps. Earlier this year, LaRose said 97,795 inactive voter files were removed in scheduled post-2020 election voter roll maintenance, a lower number than predicted after thousands of voters avoided the purge by voting and undertaking other election activities. In his announcement Wednesday, LaRose also urged for the passage of a Republican voting bill introduced this spring that prohibits the placement of ballot drop boxes anywhere but at local elections offices, eliminates a day of early voting, shortens the window for requesting mail-in ballots and tightens voter ID requirements.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge on Wednesday said she will temporarily block a state law banning public school mask mandates, but students or their parents can opt out of the requirement if they choose. Judge Natalie Mai said she will issue a temporary injunction that will go into effect next week when she issues a written order detailing her ruling. Mai said she is blocking the law because it applies only to public, not private, schools, and schools adopting a mask mandate must provide an option for parents or students to opt out of the requirement. The ruling drew praise from Gov. Kevin Stitt, who signed the law and opposes mask mandates without exemptions, and Dr. Mary Clarke, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, which joined the lawsuit brought by four parents who oppose the law. “This is a victory for parental choice, personal responsibility and the rule of law,” Stitt said in a statement. Clarke said she was also pleased with the ruling. “This is just a first step in ensuring our schools maintain local control and can choose the best path for their students, faculty and staff,” Clarke said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Slugs and snails love bread dough, finds recent research from the Oregon State University Extension Service and other universities, suggesting a cheap, easy-to-make, nontoxic and widely available solution for gardeners and farmers alike. The state’s grass seed industry loses roughly $100 million a year to the slimy pests, according to the Oregon Seed Council. “Slugs and snails have a big impact on seed crops,” said Roger Beyer, the council’s executive director. “Our guys will work with anything, be it biological, pesticides or chemicals – whatever it takes to protect their crops, but it has to be economical.” The Oregon Seed Council provides $60,000 to $70,000 a year to fund slug and snail research at OSU, including for the work of gastropod specialist Rory McDonnell, who participated in the multi-university study that discovered bread dough attracts the pests. McDonnell and his fellow researchers ran simple experiments comparing how slugs and snails are attracted to different foods, essentially pitting foods in head-to-head contests until one was determined the most attractive. Cucumber was an early front-runner, and beer and strawberries did well, but bread dough was what really called the mollusks to dinner. McDonnell said it might be deployed in the creation of molluscicides, but dough should work for now.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change passed its last regulatory hurdle Wednesday, in a hard-fought bid to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. The plan to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants won a 3-2 party-line vote from the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, a five-member panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees. The commission voted after almost six hours of testimony and nearly two years of Wolf’s administration working on the regulation and shepherding it through the long regulatory process. The vote allows Pennsylvania, through regulation, to join a multistate consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By joining the consortium, “Pennsylvania is taking a historic, proactive and progressive approach that will have significant positive environmental, public health and economic impacts,” Wolf said in a statement after the vote. Mark Szybist, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it the “most important climate action that Pennsylvania has taken in more than a decade.” At 34%, Pennsylvania’s energy sector is its largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: Some residents will be paying more for their health insurance next year, but not as much as insurers wanted them to pay, the state Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner said Thursday. The rate increases for 2022 approved by Commissioner Patrick Tigue were lower than insurers has requested. “As Rhode Islanders confront significant threats to their health and financial well-being due to the spread of COVID-19, my responsibility is to limit the burden of the cost of health insurance within the standards for review and approval set forth by law,” Tigue said in a statement. “Given the strong reserve positions of health insurers operating in the state, I did not believe that charges for profit and contributions to reserves for 2022 were consistent with the proper conduct of the insurers’ business or consistent with the public interest.” Rhode Islanders will save almost $42 million in 2022 compared to what the commercial health insurers requested, his office said. For Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which has 40,255 members in its small group plan and requested an average rate increase of 2.9%, Tigue approved a 0.3% decrease. Gail Carvelli, a spokesperson for BCBSRI, told The Boston Globe the company accepted the modifications and recognized the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Thursday tossed out a school mask mandate in the capital city, saying it contradicts a state budget measure aimed at preventing face covering requirements. State Attorney General Alan Wilson had sued Columbia after the City Council passed the ordinance requiring masks at elementary and middle schools. City leaders said the mask requirement, which carries a $100 violation fine, was meant to protect children too young to be approved for COVID-19 vaccines. But Wilson argued the city’s mask rule conflicts with the budget requirement that went into effect July 1 and bans school districts from using appropriated funds to require face coverings. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court sided unanimously with the attorney general. The Columbia ordinance is written so that the burden of enforcing the mask rule falls on school employees, “all of whom have an obvious connection to state-appropriated funds,” wrote Justice John Kittredge. That means school employees have to choose between violating state or city laws, the opinion said. “The City has made clear that every school employee is in the crosshairs,” Kittredge wrote.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers looking to remake the state’s voter-passed medical marijuana law previewed a coming battle in the Legislature on Wednesday as they recommended outlawing growing the plant in homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. A legislative subcommittee approved a spate of recommended changes to a ballot measure approved by 70% of voters last year. The law is set to take full effect in the coming months as the state government faces deadlines to issue medical marijuana identification cards and provide for the licensure of dispensaries. However, the law will continue to be in flux. Republicans, who dominate the Legislature, are currently debating just how far to go in changing the law. The subcommittee on Wednesday recommended changes that could potentially make it more difficult for people in rural areas to access the drug – most significantly by striking all provisions allowing medical marijuana ID-card holders to grow cannabis plants in their homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. The recommendations will next face approval by the Marijuana Interim Study Committee before they can be passed to the full Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state Department of Education video celebrating the return to school drew sharp criticism across social media. The 41-second video released Tuesday features Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who shares her own memories of excitedly starting school as a kindergartner. “All of our students – 1 million of them – across the state of Tennessee are starting the school year right now,” Schwinn says. “The smell of new books, clean hallways, the energy and feeling of being back in classrooms with their friends and their teachers. It’s such a special time, and I am so excited for our state.” She then asks parents to share stories about why they are excited for the new school year in the comments. The video received swift feedback from parents and teachers experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, quarantines and a growing number of schools already closing as the coronavirus spreads. As of Wednesday, Tennessee was averaging a record-setting 2,330 infections per day among school-age children, ages 5 to 18, according to state data. “How tone deaf do you have to be to ask parents to ‘share their stories’?” commenter Joshua Allen said on Facebook. Several commenters said they sent kids back to school after 18 months of avoiding the virus only to have their children exposed or infected within a few weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The state on Wednesday became the 20th and largest in the nation to allow some form of the unregulated carry of a firearm. Under the new law, most people 21 or older who haven’t been convicted of a felony can carry a holstered handgun – concealed or otherwise – in public without undergoing any training or getting a permit. Supporters of the law, including Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature, laud it as a necessary expansion of the so-called constitutional carry movement that will allow people to more easily defend themselves without government interference. But critics, including some law enforcement groups and others, say this further loosening of firearms restrictions in a state that has had more than its share of mass shootings is reckless. Until Wednesday, Texans needed a license to carry a handgun outside their homes and vehicles. To get one, they had to submit fingerprints, go through several hours of training on gun laws and gun safety, and pass a shooting proficiency test. Now, they can still take an online training course that the law requires the state to provide, but it is not necessary. While recent mass shootings have put many on edge, Texas has cultivated a strong culture of gun ownership with echoes of the Wild West, and many residents support the loosened restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A suspect charged with setting fire to three churches in the city and then leading police on a high-speed chase across Washington County that didn’t end until he crashed his minivan inside Zion National Park told police he was a “type of deity” who was acting in “righteous anger.” The man was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on seven separate charges, including two second-degree felony counts of arson and a third-degree felony count of failing to stop for a police officer, according to a report filed in 5th District Court. Local fire officials and federal agents had been investigating the string of fires as a possible hate crime, as all three happened at houses of worship of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. The suspect, a 36-year-old identified as Benjamin Johnson, was being held without bail. The police report suggests investigators worried that he could be a danger to the community and that his mental health was a consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A refugee resettlement organization is offering to accept about 100 Afghan refugees over the next several weeks if its proposal is approved by the U.S. State Department. Amila Merdzanovic of the Vermont chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said that if the request is approved, the state’s well-publicized housing crisis will prompt her organization to look for families to host at least some of the new arrivals. It would not be the first time refugees arriving in Vermont lived with host families. “In the 1970s and 1980s when Laotians and Cambodians were coming into the state, there was no refugee resettlement program, so people were being hosted by Vermonters,” said Merdzanovic, who came to Vermont in 1995 as a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina and lived with a host family when she first arrived. “That’s the model we are looking to implement.” She said Thursday that since word of the proposal first became public Wednesday, she has already received dozens of messages of support. Historically, Vermont has not been a location where refugees with the types of visas granted to the Afghans have been resettled. Merdzanovic said last week she was not expecting any Afghans, but she learned Aug. 25 that refugee resettlement agencies had two days to submit proposals.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the state can remove an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a prominent spot in its capital city, saying that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The 7-0 decision cited testimony from historians that the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the Southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. More than a century later, its continued display “communicates principles that many believe to be inconsistent with the values the Commonwealth currently wishes to express,” the justices ruled. The high court’s decision came in two lawsuits filed by residents who attempted to block Gov. Ralph Northam’s order to remove the bronze equestrian sculpture, which shows Lee in military attire atop a massive stone pedestal. Virginia promised to forever maintain the statue in the 1887 and 1890 deeds that transferred its ownership to the state. But the justices said that obligation no longer applies. “Those restrictive covenants are unenforceable as contrary to public policy and for being unreasonable because their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees,” the justices wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, the state’s most populous county is reinstating outdoor mask mandates for large events and strongly encouraging people to wear masks in other outdoor settings when they can’t remain 6 feet apart. In a statement Thursday, Public Health – Seattle & King County said as of Tuesday there will be a requirement for face masks for outdoor events of 500 or more people. The directive applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people over age 5. The recommendation for outdoor masks when people are unable to socially distance from non-household members is also for people 5 and up regardless of vaccination status. “With high rates of disease spread, and our health care system straining to keep up, it is time to take additional steps to keep ourselves and our communities safe,” the health agency said. King County, which includes Seattle, is home to about 2.2 million people. Just last week County Executive Dow Constantine had boasted that King County had one of the highest vaccination rates of any large county in the U.S. As of last week, more than 70% of people 12 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal mine officials have instructed state environmental regulators to propose a change to West Virginia’s mine cleanup program. The federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is giving the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection 60 days to submit an amendment to its reclamation program, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. An Aug. 23 letter from federal officials to state officials said a review found that the program “has not taken sufficient steps” to make sure reclamation obligations are estimated correctly. Such a failure can lead to unfunded environmental liabilities, the letter said. “The WVDEP recognizes the concerns raised in OSMRE’s notice related to reporting and disclosure and those issues will be addressed,” Environmental Protection Department Secretary Harold Ward said in a statement Wednesday, without specifying what kind of amendment the agency plans to submit. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s review of the state’s reclamation program follows lawsuits filed by environmentalist groups.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Calling the situation horrific and inexcusable, city, county and state leaders said this week that they are committed to doing what it takes to improve conditions that leave Black renters in Milwaukee far more vulnerable to electrical fires than anybody else in the city. “These people paid for a place that ultimately took their lives,” said State Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, who represents part of the city most affected by suspected electrical fires. “That’s inexcusable. ... I have no choice but to find a way to get this addressed. I honestly didn’t know that people were literally losing their lives and everything they own like this.” Johnson said she plans to reach out to Gov. Tony Evers’ office and work with colleagues in the Legislature to consider changes that could help tackle the problem. The reaction follows a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that uncovered how suspected electrical fires disproportionately harm Black renters in the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and how systems at all levels of government fail to address the underlying issues. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Evers said. “It’s very disheartening.” Evers said he already has spoken to staff members about potential ways to address the problem, which he blamed largely on legislative changes in the last decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city expects to face labor shortages across all industries as school-related coronavirus cases spike, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Quarantines and illnesses among children are forcing parents to stay home with their kids, according to the paper, and the problem has already caused issues at day cares.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}]}

And don't expect anything like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese or those lame late-night grilled cheese sandwiches you make at home when there's nothing else left to eat.\n\nIn the past, offerings have included everything from lobster macaroni and cheese to grilled cheese sandwiches with up to six different fancy cheeses.\n\nA sneak peek into what is in the works for this weekend reveals everything from a Philly cheesesteak with macaroni and cheese and Cheez Whiz from Gary's Dewey Beach Grill to La Hacienda's queso blanco grilled cheese.\n\nIf you think a day of beer and a slew of different cheeses might leave you with a belly bomb, you're probably right.\n\nBut Thompson has a different theory: \"The macaroni and cheese seems to soak up most of the alcohol.

It didn't take long for the veteran honky tonkers to bring their Monday night residency to Argilla, where they have played each week for more than two years now. Owner Steve Powell heard from a few Sin City fans that they like darker beers, so he got to work and created Sin City Stout -- a beer named for a band and created for their fans. If you're looking to try the specialty beer, here's some good news: a batch was brewed this week and Sin City Stout will be available at Argilla again beginning this weekend.\n\n​Big Oyster Brewery at Fins Ale House and Raw Bar, 19269 Del. 1, near Rehoboth Beach. bigoysterbrewery.com\n\nBeer name: Solar Power\n\nBeer type: Belgian-style white ale\n\nABV: 5.6%\n\nBehind the name: Made with peels from organic oranges, Big Oyster brewer Andrew Harton and others were brainstorming names for their new white ale -- a day-drinking-at-the-beach beer. \"It kind of gives you the power to get through the day,\" Harton says of the inspiration behind the name. Big Oyster is also home to a beer named Resistentialism, a light-hearted term used by some to describe \"seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects.'' While brewing the 9.3% ABV double IPA, just about anything that could go wrong for Harton and his crew did go wrong: \"Everything was fighting against us,\" he says, hence the name.\n\n​Blue Earl, 210 Artisan Dr., Smyrna. blueearlbrewing.com\n\nBeer name: When Doves Cry\n\nBeer type: Vienna-style amber lager\n\nABV: 4.7%\n\nBehind the name: When visiting Smyrna's Blue Earl brewery, it doesn't take long to realize that owner Ron Price is a big music fan. Price, who has played the blues in acts such as Dr. Harmonica & Rockett 88, not only had the word \"blue\" in the name of his beer company, but his beer list shouts the blues louder than Howlin' Wolf. Brews named after blues tunes include Blues Power, Walkin' Blues IPA, Trouble in Mind and You Shook Me. It was last month, the day after Prince died, when Price found himself stumped as he tried to come up with a name for his new Vienna-style lager. As he scrolled through Facebook, he decided he would pay tribute to Prince with a beer called When Doves Cry. \"After he died, I watched a video of him doing 'Purple Rain' live from 1983 and I swear to God, it just about brought tears to my eyes,\" Price says. When Doves Cry is currently available in Blue Earl's tasting room and will soon be in restaurants and bars across the state via NKS Distributors, Inc.\n\n​Crooked Hammock Brewery, 36707 Crooked Hammock Way, Lewes. crookedhammockbrewery.com\n\nBeer name: Wilbon\n\nBeer type: Belgian-style Tripel\n\nABV: 7.5%\n\nBehind the name: As Crooked Hammock was preparing to open, the new restaurant started a March Madness-styled bracket last year to name one of their first beers. ESPN \"Pardon the Interruption\" co-host Tony Kornheiser, who vacations in the area, submitted \"Wilbon\" as a nod to his co-host Michael Wilbon. Not only did Wilbon win, but it was the only beer that the brewery has ever bottled. The one-time-only brew won the contest thanks in part to a video Kornheiser made on the \"PTI\" set asking people to vote for Wilbon. So did Kornheiser mimic his on-air personality and gloat about his winning beer? Unfortunately not. \"He was actually rather humble about it,\" says Matthew Frey, Crooked Hammock's assistant general manager.\n\n​Dogfish Head Brewery, 6 Village Center Blvd., Milton. dogfish.com\n\nBeer name: Beer To Drink Music To\n\nBeer type: Belgian-style Tripel\n\nABV: 9%\n\nBehind the name: When Dogfish Head first became the official beer of Record Store Day last year, the beer company curated a limited edition, 12-song compilation album called \"Music To Drink Beer To.\" With the partnership still in place this year, Dogfish unveiled a new Record Store Day-themed beer and the name sounded familiar: Beer to Drink Music To. It's a name that perfectly fits with Dogfish's \"off-centered\" theme. \"We know it doesn't really make any sense, but at the same time, I haven't met anyone who doesn't get the joke. Everyone gets it,\" says Neal Stewart, vice president of marketing for Dogfish Head. Stewart says there are also hidden nods to some of their favorite acts and albums in the beer. Orange peels were used in honor of R.E.M.'s \"Orange Crush,\" there are peppercorns for fans of The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and the spice cardamom is in there since it's referenced in the Phish tune \"Mock Song.\"\n\n​Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company, 1284 McD Drive, Dover. fordhamanddominion.com\n\nBeer name: Double D Double IPA\n\nBeer type: Imperial IPA\n\nABV: 9%\n\nBehind the name: The brewery's best-selling brand, Double D Double IPA, is part of the brewery's pin-up series, which was inspired by their close proximity to the Dover Air Force Base. The beer's label tells a fictitious story about a female military member named Deanie Davis, known as Double D. And, yes, they are aware that Double D also refers to a bra size, but they don't market the beer with cup sizes in mind, says Ryan Telle, vice president of marketing for the beer company. \"If people have those types of imaginations and want to go with that, then so be it,\" Telle says.\n\n​Iron Hill Brewery, 147 E Main St, Newark. ironhillbrewery.com.\n\nBeer name: Mahalo, Apollo!\n\nBeer type: American pale wheat ale\n\nABV: 6.2%\n\nBehind the name: Maholo, Apollo! is not only one of the more fun names for an Iron Hill brew, but it's also the first to be canned when the company began the practice last year. It's a Belgian witbier made with American hops, lemongrass and grains of paradise. The light, summery beer's name came out of a brainstorming session where they paired maholo, the Hawaiian word meaning thanks, with Apollo, the sun god. \"We thought they sound good together because they kind of rhyme. It's as stupid as that,\" jokes Iron Hill co-founder and co-owner Mark Edelson. \"It's a mash-up beer with a mash-up name.\"\n\n​Mispillion River Brewing, 255 Mullett Run St., Milford. mispillionriverbrewing.com\n\nBeer name: Not Today Satan\n\nBeer type: American IPA\n\nABV: 7.3%\n\nBehind the name: Of all the Delaware breweries -- and we now have plenty -- no brewery revels in creating fun beer names quite like ​​Mispillion. Not Today Satan has its origins at Firefly 2015, actually. A friend saw a sign that someone was carrying around that read, \"Not today Satan, not today.\" Owner Eric Williams, says, \"We said it the entire weekend because we thought it was funny.\" The gang also threw an image of a platypus on the Not Today Satan beer can to add to the ridiculousness. Other eye-catching names include Holy Crap!, an imperial red ale, and their best-known brew, Reach Around IPA. \"It makes people laugh. Everybody deserves a Reach Around,\" Williams jokes. \"We have fun with the names because we want people to feel our fun, positive vibes.\"\n\n16 Mile Brewing Company, 413 S Bedford St, Georgetown. 16milebrewery.com\n\nBeer name: Responders Ale\n\nBeer type: American blonde ale\n\nABV: 4.1%\n\nBehind the name: 16 Mile's first hire was Mike Pfaffenhauser, who at the time was a 21-year-old member of the Memorial Fire Company in Slaughter Beach. While at 16 Mile, he was elevated to chief of the fire company and his two worlds came together in 2011. The brewery decided to create Responders Ale with $3 for every case and $5 for every keg donated to the National Fallen Firefighters Fund, says owner Brett McCrea. Pfaffenhauser is now a deputy fire marshal with the state and no longer works at 16 Mile, but the beer lives on and is served each year at the Georgetown Oyster Eat.\n\n​3rd Wave Brewing Co., 501 N Bi State Blvd, Delmar. 3rdwavebrewingco.com\n\nBeer name: Beach Juice\n\nBeer type: Berliner Weisse\n\nABV: 3%\n\nBehind the name: 3rd Wave's beers have plenty of beach-themed names, such as Shorebreak Pale Ale, Big Reef Porter and 1st Wave IPA. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Beach Juice followed suit. The easy-drinking day beer got its name with the future in mind. When 3rd Wave begins to can their beers, co-owner Lori Clough says Beach Juice's can will be deigned to look like a juice box. \"It will even look like it has a straw on the side of it. It's basically going to be the adult version of a juice box,\" she says.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

The Starboard in Dewey Beach, which is known best for selling Orange Crushes and Bud Lights, added craft beers three years ago and they already account for nearly 20 percent of all beer sales.\n\nSo this beer bubble is bound to burst, right? Think again.\n\nIndustry watchers, brewery owners and restaurateurs agree: there are no signs of slowing. In fact, most say Delaware is still behind the curve.\n\nFigures from the Brewers Association, a trade group that represents the craft brewing industry, points to room for growth in Delaware. While the state ranks 19th in the number of craft breweries per capita, it ranks sixth in terms of craft beer intake.\n\n\"Delawareans are getting their beer from somewhere – not necessarily Delaware breweries,\" says Wilmington-based beer expert and author John Medkeff Jr. \"What that tells me is that there's a lot of potential for local breweries, along with the state's distributors and restaurants.\"\n\nFor Ron Price, owner and founder of Smyrna's Blue Earl Brewing Co., one of Delaware's newest breweries, he has seen no signs of slowing in the fast-growing industry.\n\n\"I understand there are some folks who think this bubble may burst and maybe sooner rather than later. I don't think that's necessarily the case here because we're seeing a change in culture,\" says Price, who opened Blue Earl in May. \"I don't think craft beer drinkers are going to all of a sudden say, 'You know what? This is not for me.' This is a renaissance.\"\n\nCraft brews gain in prestige, popularity\n\nThe shift away from brand loyalty in the beer world is a side-effect of the craft beer explosion with new beers being created and brought to market daily.\n\nFor those used to a keg of Bud Light or Yuengling at a summertime backyard barbecue, it's no longer a surprise finding a wide assortment of craft beers from multiple breweries being sampled and passed around.\n\n\"The consumer is becoming more educated and more interested in trying new things constantly. It's ever-evolving,\" says Ted Stewart, craft brand manager for New Castle-based Standard Distributing Co. \"You have beer nerds or beer geeks who are like hipsters with music – they want the new stuff before everyone else.\"\n\nWhen Sam Calagione founded Dogfish Head in 1995 as the state's first brewpub, there were 858 craft breweries in the U.S. Last year, the Brewers Association reported 3,464. That's a 303 percent increase in craft breweries over a 20-year period.\n\nLast year, craft brewers produced 22.2 million barrels of beer – an 18 percent jump in volume over the year before, according to association figures.\n\n\"That's awesome as a beer drinker, but we'd be naive to assume that growth rate is sustainable,\" says Calagione, who believes the industry will continue to grow for years, but not at that accelerated rate. \"The consumers will decide which breweries survive and thrive and I'm confident that most will.\"\n\nOverall, microbreweries are still a drop in the beer barrel compared to worldwide beer giants Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors.\n\nCraft breweries only account for 11 percent of the market share in the beer industry, marking the first time it ever broke double digits, according to 2014 figures from the trade association. The industry has set a goal of owning 20 percent of the market by 2020.\n\nCalagione predicts that the first major signs of a craft beer slow-down in Delaware would come in the form of a brewery closing its doors. And these days, they only seem to be swinging open.\n\n\"Until you see a brewery go out of business, you'll see a healthy environment,\" he says. \"And if Delaware breweries focus on quality, consistency and being well differentiated, I don't foresee a Delaware brewery closing any time soon.\"\n\nMedkeff agrees, pointing toward history.\n\nIn the 1870s in the United States, there were over 3,000 breweries for about 40 million people. Today, there's about 3,500 breweries for seven times the number of people.\n\n\"That speaks well for the potential for growth,\" he says, especially considering that Delaware's largest city, Wilmington, does not have any production breweries.\n\nMedkeff, whose new book \"Brewing in Delaware\" ($21.99, Arcadia Publishing) is due in stores Aug. 10, sees the return to locally based brewing as a trip back to the future.\n\nAfter all, the brew game is coming full circle back to the days before Prohibition when hometown brews dominated early American life.\n\n\"Brewpubs existed from the earliest colonial days and were generally small operations run at hospitality houses that had saloons attached,\" he says. \"They were spread along colonial roads with no railroads or refrigeration, making their business from travelers going from one town to the next.\"\n\nEven though large-scale, non locally-sourced breweries have dominated in the nearly 100 years since Prohibition, brewpubs began to re-appear again in the mid-80s, concentrated mostly in California and the Northwest.\n\nCraft beer now a must-stock item\n\nDelaware has 15 craft breweries that are either already open or preparing to open soon, including Lewes' Crooked Hammock Brewery, opening later this summer, and the Dewey Beer Co., which opened in May. The majority of Delaware's craft breweries have opened in just the past five years or so.\n\nThe Dewey Beer. Co. is located across the street from one of the party town's biggest bars, The Starboard.\n\nOnly three years ago, The Starboard didn't carry any craft beers. That changed after co-owner Steve \"Monty\" Montgomery began getting requests for craft brews from his staff. They had caught the craft beer buzz even before The Starboard's customers, who rarely requested the small batch beers.\n\nTwelve craft beer taps made their debut at The Starboard opening weekend 2012. Those taps and the other dozen or so craft beer bottles The Starboard now carries account for nearly a fifth of all beer sales, Montgomery days.\n\nIt's a number that might jump even higher now that Dewey's first brewery opened across Del. 1, already leading to more cross-pollination between craft beer drinkers and lovers of traditional domestics.\n\n\"The world is changing. Nothing against the domestics of the world, but people now are specifically going to places like The Picked Pig Pub or the Henlopen City Oyster House to find great beers,\" Montgomery says. \"They almost treat it like wine: they're swilling it, sniffing it, tasting it. People are more into quality over quantity in this day and age.\n\n\"It's really overwhelming to keep track of all these great beers and not feel like a complete alcoholic because you have to go out every other day to try new beers.\"\n\nOver at Standard Distributing, best known for supplying beers like Miller Lite, Coors Light and Yuengling to bars and liquor stores, Stewart's position as the craft beer manger was created just last year.\n\nHe's in charge of selling nearly 20 different craft brands that range from local brews like Greenville's Twin Lakes and Georgetown's 16 Mile to California's Lagunitas Brewing Company and New York's Brooklyn Brewery.\n\nOver the past two or three years, Stewart estimates Standard has doubled or tripled its craft beer sales in the state, making it 10 to 15 percent of their current business.\n\n\"And even though you see craft beer everywhere, Delaware is still behind the game. If you go to Philly, it's even more prevalent. Delaware is on its way, but we still have a way to go,\" he says.\n\nCrooked Hammock co-owner Rich Garrahan says his new brewery, which also includes a restaurant with live music and a beer garden, should be open in early September.\n\nThe brewery, which is part of the newly formed La Vida Hospitality Group that includes Rehoboth Beach restaurant Nage, is located just outside of Lewes on Kings Highway off Del.1 – making it the Lewes area's only brewery.\n\nFive Crooked Hammock beers will be available to start, along with other locally brewed cold ones. Other local partner restaurants, including Nage and Big Chill Surf Cantina, are also expected to eventually carry the Crooked brews.\n\n\"Before Prohibition, there were local breweries all over the place. That trend is coming back and restaurants are realizing, 'Hey, we can brew our own beer, too. We don't have to serve the same thing as everybody else,' \" Garrahan says. \"For people who think there are too many brewpubs, just about every other restaurant in [the state] is serving the same beer. There's only a few of us serving something different. I don't think we're over-saturated. It's way under-saturated.\"\n\nOpening a brewery 'extremely painstaking'\n\nIf you're a beer drinker or even a home brewer, Blue Earl's Ron Price warns that opening a brewery is a massive undertaking.\n\nA home brewer himself dating back 20 years to when Dogfish first arrived on the scene, Price began his brewing career in his garage.\n\nHe now hosts beer-lovers and live music fans in his tap room at the 11,535-square-foot facility, which has been pumping out IPAs, saisons and stouts for two months now.\n\nEven as the time nears when his beer will be available in local restaurants and in stores – the end of summer and fall, respectively –the excitement is tempered by the tough journey it took to get to this point.\n\nPrice warns that the process is not for the faint of heart. You have to juggle business plans, investors, bank loans and construction, along with an unholy trinity of city, state and federal officials who are all making sure the operation is following regulations.\n\n\"I think people should pursue their dreams, but opening a brewery is a daunting task. It's not for a weak-hearted or -minded. It's extremely painstaking,\" he says, nearly sighing at the memories. \"It takes every bit of your blood, sweat and tears to do it.\"\n\nIf you're wondering just how mainstream craft beer is in Delaware, all you have to do is follow around Calagione, Delaware's own King of Beers.\n\nThe man who began his pioneering craft beer dynasty in Delaware is the nearest thing we have to a rock star.\n\nCalagione isn't only recognized by fawning beer buffs at beer events or when visiting bars – he's recognized just about everywhere.\n\nHis visits to the Apple store at the Christiana Mall can especially morph from shopping trip to meet-and greet. It's that excitement for craft beer that has fueled not only the industry as a whole, but his own company. Dogfish, he says, is on pace for double-digit growth for the 17th year in a row.\n\n\"There's a lot of overlap in the demographics of computer nerds and beer geeks,\" Calagione says. \"When I go into the Apple store, I can predict there will be beer lovers there who are going to want to high-five and selfie it out.\"\n\n-- Ryan Cormier, The News Journal.

Wilmington's new beer garden opens", "text": "Ryan Cormier\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThere will be beer.\n\nThe new Constitution Yards Beer Garden on Wilmington's Riverfront opened Friday at 4 p.m., but that doesn't mean craft brews will definitely flow through the taps all summer.\n\nDelaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissioner John Cordrey has issued a daily liquor license to the beer garden, which took effect Thursday and runs through Monday.\n\nThe license was granted ahead of the already-scheduled July 7 public hearing before the Office of Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control. The hearing will determine whether the beer garden will receive a biennial gathering license, which would be renewed every two years.\n\nCordrey says Constitution Yards' temporary Delaware Division of Public Health certificate expires Monday, so he could only approve a daily license through Monday. State health inspectors are expected to return to the beer garden Monday. If a new certificate is earned, Cordrey could approve of daily licenses through July 7.\n\nDelaware's most interesting beer names (& the stories behind them)\n\nThe 20,000-square-foot beer garden, which is believed to be the first proper beer garden in Delaware since Prohibition, will be open this weekend from 4 p.m. to midnight Friday, noon to midnight Saturday and noon to 9 p.m. Sunday. There is no admission. All ages are allowed, although you must be at least 21 to order alcohol.\n\nThe beer garden is managed by Connecticut-based Imian Partners. It has opened multiple beer gardens on the East Coast, including Manhattan's Local, located next to Madison Square Garden, and the Beer Garden at Shippan Landing in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nConstitution Yards will have 10 beer draft lines (Dogfish Head, Fordham & Dominion, Yards, Victory, etc.) with about 15 different varieties of canned beer also available. The waterfront, open-air spot will also offer four types of wine available on draft, along with spirits from Rehoboth Beach's Delaware Distilling Company.\n\nSTORY: Wilmington's Riverfront gets large-scale beer garden\n\nSTORY: Wilmington beer garden opening may be delayed\n\n\"Upscale barbecue\" is the food theme for Constitution Yards with an on-site rotisserie for chicken. It's also serving ribs, hamburgers, hot dogs, sausage sandwiches and more.\n\nThe large-scale gathering space, which hosted Bromberg's Big Noise in the Neighborhood music festival in 2010, has backyard games like corn hole, Wiffle ball and bocce. The beer garden is expected to close after Oktoberfest with the Riverfront ice skating rink returning in the winter.\n\nThe dog- and children-friendly beer garden has faced a fight from nearby neighbors with concerns about noise, traffic and drunken behavior. The homeowner's association for the Condominiums at Justison Landing, which stands adjacent to the beer garden, officially opposes the location.\n\nAmy Riley, 51, who lives in the condominiums, shares some of their concerns about parking and noise, but she is excited to check out the beer garden's opening this weekend.\n\n\"I like that this gives us three weeks to see what it's like,\" Riley says. \"I tend to be fairly open-minded, so I'm not going to come out of the gate and be against something without having any negative experience with it.\"\n\nThe Atlanta native, who moved to the Riverfront in late 2013, says she's more interested in the barbecue than the beer: \"I miss barbecue quite a bit. I saw the giant, open grill they used for their soft opening, so that looks really promising.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

And it just might be the city's first proper beer garden since Prohibition.\n\n\n\nThe 20,000-square-foot space is being built at Justison Landing Park along the Christina Riverwalk and could open sometime between June 15 and 22, depending on licensing approvals.\n\nIt comes at a time when interest in craft beer is booming – an interest that has not only spawned a new generation of in-state breweries, but now beer gardens as well.\n\nThe Riverfront Development Corp. is behind the beer garden, bringing in Connecticut-based Imian Partners, a real estate development and hospitality firm, to manage and operate it.\n\nImian has opened multiple beer gardens on the East Coast in recent years, including Manhattan's Local, located next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, and the Beer Garden at Shippan Landing in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nConstitution Yards sits where the seasonal Riverfront Rink ice skating rink opened in 2014, and it will offer everything from craft beer and frozen cocktails to barbecue and beer cheese fries.\n\nThe expansive gathering space, which hosted 2010's Bromberg's Big Noise in the Neighborhood music festival, will also offer backyard games like corn hole, whiffle ball and bocce.\n\n\"It'll be a fully family-friendly, dog-friendly concept,\" says Johnny Heil, a partner with Imian Partners. \"And even though it's seasonal, it's a big buildout. It's not like we're just popping up an ice cream stand with some tables.\"\n\nWhile the city's bar scene noticeably drops off during the summer with many leaving Wilmington for Delaware's beaches, some outdoor spots like Firestone Roasting House on the Riverfront draw large crowds with people looking for an open-air hangout.\n\nWith its location only feet from the Christina River filled with outdoor games and summer-themed drinks and food, Constitution Yards hopes to inject more summertime life into the area, which has gained everything from an IMAX movie theater to Riverwalk Mini Golf in recent years.\n\nPart of the message is this: The Riverfront is not just a place to visit, but also to live. Buccini/Pollin Group, owners of the Justison Landing property and several nearby condominiums, hope additions like the new beer garden fuel interest.\n\nMichael Hare, a BPG senior vice president, says Constitution Yards will bring Wilmington in line with other cities, many of which already boast beer gardens.\n\n\"We think this will put Wilmington on the map when it comes to fun things to do in the city, especially during the summer,\" he says.\n\nThe beer garden will close after Oktoberfest and the Riverfront Rink will return in the winter. The rink could possibly use some of the beer garden's amenities, such as the full-service kitchen which is being built on site, but no decisions have been made.\n\nNews Journal article spurred project\n\nImian was contacted about the project by the RDC last year after a News Journal article detailing eight fun things Wilmington needs. Beer gardens led the list. \"That really spurred it,\" Heil says.\n\n\"With the state's growing love affair with craft beers and city officials pushing outdoor events, pop-up beer gardens would be a perfect fit,\" the August 2015 55 Hours cover story read.\n\nThe new beer garden does not yet have a license to start slinging suds. However, the RDC has applied for a bi-annual gathering license, which could be renewed every two years and is only available for not-for-profit entities, says Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Commissioner John Cordrey.\n\nCordrey and the Office of Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control is currently reviewing the application. Cordrey could not say when a decision would be made.\n\nPart of the application review will involve investigating whether a nonprofit like the RDC can hold the license and allow a for-profit company like Imian Partners to operate the beer garden.\n\nHeil says Imian is receiving a management fee from the RDC to run the spot with any profits made from Constitution Yards going to the RDC and back into the beer garden.\n\nIf the extended license is rejected, Constitution Yards could be forced to apply daily for a special gathering license.\n\nWith no state alcohol laws specifically written for the recently re-popularized beer gardens, state Rep. Helene Keeley, D-Wilmington South, introduced a bill earlier this year to allow beer gardens to operate for months at a time with an eye on the upcoming Constitution Yards.\n\nThe legislation was pulled after facing resistance from Delaware Restaurant Association, which objected, calling it too vague with concerns about oversight, security and staff training.\n\nKeeley says she plans on re-introducing the bill in January, blaming the pushback on miscommunication about how the bill would work.\n\nDelaware Restaurant Association President Carrie Leishman says while her group opposes the bill, it does not oppose the Riverfront beer garden: \"Sure, bring it on.\"\n\n'Elevated backyard barbecue'\n\nThe beer garden will have 10 beer draft lines, rotating craft brews that will include local favorites such as Delaware's Dogfish Head and Fordham & Dominion and Philadelphia's Yards and Victory. A chalkboard will list the beers available, allowing for moment-by-moment swaps when a keg empties. There will also be about 15 different varieties of canned beer available, including those from Milford's Mispillion River Brewing.\n\nFour types of wine will be available on draft, along with organic Kelvin Slush Co. frozen cocktails and an array of spirits from Rehoboth beach-based Delaware Distilling Company.\n\nIn terms of food, there will be an on-site rotisserie for chicken, which will be offered alongside ribs, hamburgers, hot dogs, sausage sandwiches, along with items like cornbread and soft pretzels from the Chesapeake Pretzel Company.\n\n\"It's elevated backyard barbecue ,\" says Tim Lux, Constitution Yards general manager and Imian partner.\n\nConstitution Yards will be open seven days a week with exact hours to be determined, but it is expected to open Monday through Thursday at 4 p.m. and close at 9 p.m., depending on business. It could open as early as 2 p.m. on Fridays for an early happy hour crowd and on Saturday and Sunday, it will open at noon.\n\nThe beer garden is expected to close by 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights and will not be open until 1 a.m. like many of the bars and restaurants in the city. No live music is currently planned.\n\nA beer garden in Wilmington may seem au courant, but it's actually a throwback.\n\nBeer gardens in Wilmington date back to the 1800s when German immigrants introduced them to the area, according to John Medkeff Jr., a Delaware beer expert and author of \"Brewing in Delaware\" (Arcadia Publishing, $21.99).\n\nSpots included Hartmann & Fehrenbach brewery's Rosendale Pleasure Grounds along the Brandywine River just south of Augustine Cut-Off, Wilmington brewer Joseph Stoeckle's biergarten on King Street and Bavarian Park at Fifth and DuPont streets.\n\n\"This is like the old-style beer gardens they used to have where there was more going on that just grabbing a bite and beer,\" he says. \"They used to have pinball alleys with duck pin bowling and all sorts of stuff going on like bands, dancing and more.\"\n\nBut could a modern day beer garden work on the Riverfront? Medkeff thinks it could have a shot.\n\n\"It could work because of all the other things and cool amenities surrounding it, but it's going to be dependent on foot traffic and the residents who live nearby supporting it,\" he adds.\n\nA 200-person beer garden near Chelsea Tavern was announced earlier this year, but the project's fate is unknown following the February death of Chelsea Tavern owner Scott Morrison. Joe Van Horn, the operational owner/general manager of Morrison's Delaware restaurants, did not return a call.\n\nFor Riverfront businesses like Veritas Wine & Craft Beer, Constitution Yards could have both positive and negative effects, says owner Venu Gaddamidi, whose store is on Justison Street across from the beer garden.\n\nWith parking tight around his store, he's concerned that some customers could be inconvenienced. At the same time, the beer garden could bring more people to the area – possibly for the first time.\n\nAnd for a shop that doesn't advertise much, instead relying on word-of-mouth and pedestrian discovery, it could provide a boost, even though the introduction of the Riverfront Rink did not.\n\n\"It was a bunch of parents dropping kids. They are not dropping off little Timmy to go ice skating and then coming in here and having five scotches. For the beer garden, they are coming to drink, so it's a little more down my path,\" says Gaddamidi, who has been watching the ambitious project progress day-by-day from his front window. \"It's coming along and it looks like they are investing for the long run.\"\n\nConstitution Yards isn't the only new high-profile food-and-drink spot coming to the Riverfront.\n\nBig Fish Restaurant Group, which recently brought the Trolley Square Oyster House to Wilmington, is opening a 6,000-square-foot Taco Grande Mexican Grille and Tequila Bar, according to an RDC-sponsored spread in June's Out & About magazine.\n\nThe restaurant, which would be located between Big Fish Grill on the Riverfront and Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant, could open by late fall, the report stated.\n\nRepresentatives for the Big Fish Restaurant Group would not comment on the project.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

It's a real honor and confirms we are on the right track with our Delaware Quaint Villages branding. It was a treat they took notice themselves.\"\n\nVestfall said Delaware’s Quaint Villages in Kent County offer adventure, historical and culinary activities. The villages surrounding Dover have similar attractions and a multitude of options to discover for an idyllic getaway, she said.\n\nShe said the whole idea around Quaint Villages is for people to spend a day hiking at Killens Pond State Park, tour through Amish country, try their luck at one of the county's casinos or sample wine, beer and spirits at local favorites such as Painted Stave Distilling and Mispillion River Brewing.\n\nThe Quaint Villages branding effort was launched in 2016 after visitor spending in Kent County saw a slight decline of less than 1 percent in 2015. The state as a whole saw an increase of 4.1 percent to reach $4.4 billion, a new record high.\n\nVestfall said in a November 2017 story in The News Journal that her organization not only wants to reverse the trend but also to provide an identity for Kent County and give people a reason to come and stay a little while longer.\n\nShe says Dover landing on Expedia.com's \"Best Place to Escape\" list is an affirmation of how well the marketing plan is working.\n\nKent County has seen a $4.5 million windfall in tourism spending since Jan. 1, 2017, and is well on its way to its $12.4 million goal by the end of June 2018.\n\nThe tourism director says Kent County is never going to be the beaches, but she wants tourism in Kent County to have a different appeal.\n\n\"Not a lot of people really knew what Kent County had to offer before the marketing campaign was launched,\" she said. \"We're not just the county you go through to get to the beaches.\"\n\nIn Expedia.com's \"best of\" list, Little Creek Wildlife Area, among others, was listed as a place to escape. Located directly east of Dover, hugging the coast, \"you can find quiet moments to bird watch and catch a glimpse of the graceful waterfowl,\" according to the site.\n\nSilver Lake Park also got a nod from Rogers and the Expedia.com folks, as did Pickering Beach, according to the blog.\n\n\"Stop for a spot of tea or a full tea service at Tea for Two, a lovely English tea house set in one of Dover’s historical painted lady houses, where menu options are whimsically named after “Gone with the Wind” characters,\" Rogers wrote.\n\nOther popular places in and around Dover include The Green, Biggs Museum, Air Mobility Museum, Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, Woodburn, John Dickinson Plantation, First State Heritage Park, Legislative Hall and the Old State House.\n\n\"Quaint Villages is an alternative to our wonderful beaches,\" Vestfall said. \"We want people who come to our county to have an opportunity to slow down and enjoy a quiet getaway; to escape the bumper-to-bumper traffic in a place where you can step away and take a breath.\"\n\nTo learn more about Delaware’s Quaint Villages and to discover more adventures, visit www.visitdelawarevillages.com, and follow them on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

I said, 'Are you in or are you out?' \" said Kammerer, 43, echoing a favorite Haley saying that usually came before he asked a favor.\n\n\"They all stayed. One of the most important things we did is we made a commitment to stick together as a group,\" he said. \"My two goals every day are I want to improve the lives of the people we work with and keep guests happy.\"\n\nAlthough the SoDel restaurants never closed, Haley's death, just months after he received three of the culinary world's highest honors, temporarily threw the company into turmoil.\n\nBut, Kammerer stopped mourning after a celebration of Haley's life was held, about a month later, on a unseasonable warm late September afternoon at an outdoor concert stage near Selbyville.\n\n\"The day we did the celebration of life at the Freeman Stage was the day it all changed,\" said Kammerer of the service attended by about 2,000 people.\n\nNearly two years later, the eight SoDel Concepts restaurants in Rehoboth, Lewes, Fenwick Island, Bethany Beach and Ocean View that operated while Haley was alive continue to thrive. So is the company's catering company, the food truck Big Thunder Roadside Kitchen and its hospitality consulting and management divisions.\n\nThis June, a ninth restaurant will open in Lewes. Another eatery is planned for 2017, possibly a seafood/steakhouse, off Del. 1 in the Rehoboth area. After that, Kammerer says there could be expansion beyond Sussex County. There's talk of building restaurants in New Castle County and beyond the state, possibly in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nIndeed, life has gone on.\n\nOn SoDel Concepts company literature and its web site, there's no longer any mention of the parent company, the Matt Haley Companies, which Haley founded in 2012, according to his still existing Linkedin account. The name is owned by the estate, says Nelia Dolan, SoDel's head of marketing, and can no longer be used.\n\nLast year, Kammerer asked Alan Levin, the former head of Delaware's Economic Development Office and CEO of his family's former Happy Harry’s chain, to come aboard as a senior management adviser.\n\nVIDEO: Matt Haley teaches us to make a lobster roll\n\nSTORY: SoDel Concepts launches flavored salts\n\nSTORY: Early crabs: Prices down, quality up\n\nLevin became friendly with Haley about five years before his death. \"He cooked me quiche one day. I hate quiche, but his was pretty good,\" Levin joked.\n\nThe restaurateur wanted to meet with Levin to talk about his health issues - Haley had suffered from ongoing bouts of cancer over the years - and how he could eventually transition his businesses to the key players on his team.\n\nAfter Haley's death, Levin helped Kammerer negotiate with the Haley estate and they began talking about how to take the restaurant organization \"to the next level.\"\n\nLevin was familiar with the process of moving a business organization forward after a death. He had to do the same thing at age 31 when his father Harry Levin died in 1987 and Alan took over his father's growing Happy Harry's operation, once the largest drugstore chain in the state. Happy Harry's was acquired by Walgreens in 2006.\n\nLevin works three days a week with SoDel and said he serves as a \"sounding board\" for Kammerer. They talk about future sites for businesses and make strategic decisions. He said the restaurant industry is not unlike other businesses.\n\n\"It's still taking care of people and consumer's desires and finding out what makes them happy,\" Levin said. \"I'm not selling toothpaste, but, at the same time, you're taking a product and you're hoping people like it. The objective is to serve the customers well so they come back for more.\"\n\nKammerer has made some changes of his own. He now brings in motivational speakers to keep up company morale and boost spirits. And other spin-off businesses are expanding. In addition to an artisanal soda line, it's now being bottled at Fordham & Dominion Brewing in Dover, the restaurants also sell packaged flavored salts and the SoDel film division produces videos for the company's social media sites.\n\nKammerer, a nurturer by nature, said he most enjoys watching SoDel chefs and managers succeed, whether it's appearing on TV or being asked to cook at the James Beard House in New York, which they have done numerous times.\n\n\"Great chefs want to work with us,\" he said and mentions Andrew Feeley, formerly of Eden in Rehoboth and Metro Pub & Grill in Middletown, who has recently come aboard as the executive chef of Bluecoast.\n\nHaley's memory, and his vision of serving \"beautiful, simple food,\" remains. Small black-and-white photos of him hang on the walls of all the restaurants. In the SoDel offices, there are larger color portraits.\n\nHaley, considered one of Delaware's most respected culinary ambassadors and philanthropists, is hard to forget. The 53-year-old overcame addiction to drugs and alcohol in his 30s after spending four years in prison. He learned to cook and became a successful restaurant owner and eventually a globe-trotting humanitarian. Haley once estimated his eight Delaware restaurants and spin-off businesses generated between $45 to $50 million in revenue.\n\nIn 2014, he was the first Delaware restaurateur to receive a medal from the James Beard Foundation, the nation's preeminent recognition program for food and beverage professionals.\n\nHonors for his Delaware and international humanitarian efforts also came that year from the International Association of Culinary Professionals and the National Restaurant Association.\n\nYet, while he was the face of the company, Kammerer said Haley wasn't part of the day-to-day operations. He wasn't in the kitchen patting together crabcakes, making sure beverage orders were delivered or seeing that guests were happy on a daily basis. Instead, Haley handpicked staff members to keep things running smoothly.\n\n\"He spent six months a year traveling,\" said Kammerer, who has been making most of the major decisions since being named company president in 2011. He said Chef Doug Ruley, SoDel's Vice President and Director of Culinary Operations, wrote the menus for company's last six restaurants, not Haley.\n\nHaley courted the media and enjoyed the limelight. But, after his death, Nelia Dolan, SoDel's head of marketing, had to practically shove Kammerer in front of cameras to represent the SoDel brand.\n\n\"There has to be one person to identify with,\" she told Kammerer, a former champion wrestler and All-American football player from East Brunswick, N.J.\n\nKammerer, who has earned degrees in business from Rutgers University and in hospitality management at Cornell University, admits he was reluctant to take on the public role. \"I knew I could not replace Matt Haley. I'm a builder. I like to tinker. I'm a coach by nature. I enjoy seeing people succeed.\"\n\nAnd the married father of three boys also knew he had to take a different approach with employees than Haley, who was single.\n\n\"Matt and I had the same message, but different deliveries,\" he said. While Haley cared deeply about helping people, Kammerer has noted that he also was a complex man, who was always blunt with his opinions and liked to use profanity – a lot.\n\nKammerer, a veteran of the Sussex County beach restaurant scene, has worked at a variety of eateries, including Dos Locos, the Blue Moon, the old Royal Treat and Jake's Seafood House. He estimates he has worked in, run, consulted, or owned nearly 50 restaurants over his more than 20-year career.\n\nHe met Haley at 24 on the steps of a church and they became friends despite a 10-year age difference. Kammerer remembers Haley telling him: \"I'm going to build a restaurant empire. Think you can help me?\"\n\nKammerer talked to his wife Lisa about leaving his job as a manager at a successful seafood restaurant.\n\n\"She was like 'absolutely not,' \" he said, chuckling. But Haley wouldn't give up. He invited the couple over for dinner and Haley somehow convinced Lisa it was smart career move for Kammerer, even though she later told her husband \"he sounds crazy.\"\n\nTogether, Haley and Kammerer started a restaurant consulting business and began building Sussex County restaurants. Kammerer said the best piece of advice Haley ever gave him was \"open your heart and be respectful to other people.\" It something that he practices daily.\n\nSoDel's latest project, a second Matt's Fish Camp, is expected to open this June in the Tenley Court shopping center off Del. 1 in Lewes.\n\nIt will be somewhat similar to the original location in Bethany's Tower Shores area. The 3,200 square foot building, formerly the home of Tijuana Taxi and the original Lazy Susan's, is \"a way to honor my friend and mentor,\" said Kammerer. But while it is named for Haley, it might be closer to Kammerer's personality.\n\n\"I love Matt's Fish Camp. It's one of my favorite restaurants. It most suits my personality. It's a humble, honest concept,\" he said of the coming soon 90-seat restaurant that will have a 12-seat raw bar and outdoor seating.\n\nThe dining room will feature reclaimed wood from an old Cambridge, Maryland, oyster shack, and a Wilmington shipyard. Kammerer said he is psyched that the chef will be Maurice Catlett, who started out at SoDel Concepts as a dishwasher.\n\n\"Matt was a mentor to him. This is good for him,\" he said.\n\nKammerer said while he will continue to honor Haley – \"Matt always said 'Serve great food and we'll always be successful'\" – he also is focusing on the future.\n\n\"We're working on our own legacy.\"\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2016/10/26/halloween-weekend-delaware-we-scare-up-suggestions/92672024/", "title": "Yikes! 36 weekend Halloween bashes in Delaware", "text": "Ryan Cormier\n\nThe News Journal\n\nDonald Trump costume: Orange make-up, fluffy (blond?) wig and red tie.
