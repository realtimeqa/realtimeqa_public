It wasn't until she started seeing how couples were portrayed on TV that she started to recognize the practice was unusual.\n\nAfter that, Hsu, a Chinese American writer and student at Georgetown University, began to feel the stigma of her parents' sleeping arrangements whenever she confided in her peers.\n\n\"Anytime a friend was visiting my house, I felt the need to explain and justify my parent's bedroom situation before they saw the layout of our home,\" she says. Though her friends tried to appear supportive, \"some of them couldn't hide their shock or surprise.\"\n\nCouples sleeping apart has become increasingly common: A 2012 survey by the Better Sleep Council and a 2017 survey from the National Sleep Foundation both showed 1 in 4 couples now sleep in separate beds. But \"there's still shame attached to it for some people because of how taboo the topic is,\" says Dr. Meir Kryger, a professor of medicine at Yale's School of Medicine and author of \"The Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine.\"\n\nKryger says no couple should feel embarrassed about the practice: \"For a lot of couples, sleeping apart can be the best thing for their relationship.\" However, experts agree sleeping separately impacts the family as a whole, and it's important parents address the sleeping arrangements with their kids.\n\nKryger has met with families where children have experienced embarrassment, insecurities, or concerns as a result of their parents' sleeping arrangements.\n\n\"Some kids have even wondered if their parents' decision to sleep apart means they're not in love anymore,\" he says.\n\nParents can also worry they're modeling unhealthy behavior, or that their children may want to similarly sleep apart from their significant other someday.\n\n\"The effects of sleeping in separate rooms can be extremely positive for a relationship, extremely negative for a relationship, or anything in between,\" says Manhattan psychologist Dr. Joseph Cilona, who explains it all comes down to the couple's reason for wanting to sleep apart in the first place. \"Each couple should examine and discuss clearly and specifically their thoughts, feelings, and needs around this issue to find a mutually satisfying compromise.\"\n\nSome common reasons couples sleep apart include snoring, restlessness, parasomnia, frequent trips to the bathroom, or incompatible sleep schedules.\n\nKryger says, \"There's no research that suggests that couples who sleep apart for the purpose of better sleep have any less of a romantic connection than couples who share a bed.\"\n\nAnother point Kryger stressed was that parents who sleep apart can mitigate their children's concerns over the strength of their bond by demonstrating their love in other ways.\n\n\"Children who observe their parents regularly holding hands, complimenting each other, or snuggling together on the couch will find any insecurities they've felt quickly abated,\" he says.\n\nOf course, sometimes sleeping separately does represent a disconnection.\n\n\"There are some couples for whom the decision to sleep apart is a sign of something awry in the relationship,\" says Wendy Troxel, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corp. and author of \"Sharing the Covers: Every Couple’s Guide to Better Sleep.\"\n\nKryger adds that if a couple's desire to sleep apart stems from a romantic disconnection or marital problems, \"parents shouldn't mince words or send the children mixed messages.\"\n\nHe also says there's hope for couples who sleep apart due to sleep incompatibility who may want to start sleeping in the same bed or bedroom again.\n\n\"Virtually every sleep problem has a solution,\" he says. \"Many fixes are quite simple; other times, couples should seek professional help.\"\n\nParents who are worried their decision to sleep apart might negatively impact their children should consider the long-term strain of unhappily sharing a bed, Cilona says.\n\n\"Incompatible sleep schedules has been associated with relationship difficulties and higher rates of divorce,\" he says, adding that adults are \"not so different than children\" when it comes to how a lack of sleep affects our behavior toward others.\n\nWhile Troxel says there's very little research on how children are impacted by their parents' sleeping arrangements, the \"rising trend of couples choosing to sleep apart,\" indicates \"this will become an issue that more families may need to address.\" Troxel says such conversations should be open and honest, age-appropriate, and matter-of-fact.\n\n“Explain to the child that families are different in many different ways,\" she says, adding that for certain families, \"parents sleep better when they sleep apart, and getting healthy sleep is really important.\"\n\nIn the end, even younger children understand the importance of a good night's rest – and older children may even see the wisdom in their parents choosing less orthodox sleeping arrangements.\n\nA conclusion Hsu says she came to herself: \"My parents sleeping apart demonstrated to me that they had enough confidence in their relationship that they were willing to detour from the normative path.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/09/separate-beds-married-couples-can-help-relationship-experts-say/4657215002/", "title": "Why so many married couples are sleeping in separate beds", "text": "For many married Americans, nighttime means curling up in a bed shared with their spouse.

Spouses may work different schedules. One may snore or have restless legs syndrome. And sleep is disrupted.\n\nHowever, even if the switch to two beds may be the best solution, many couples still fear the nighttime split, Lankler said.\n\nAsking a couple whether they'd consider separate beds can causes a sort of \"catch-22\" mentality: Sharing a bed might mean disrupted sleep while sleeping in separate beds could kill intimacy, she said.\n\nFacebook status – Divorced:Why millennials 'killed' how you decouple in the digital age\n\nLankler has seen couples work through these fears by having open and honest communication. \"There's a very healthy way to do it that enhances communication and enhances freedom in the relationship,\" she said. \"I love the fact that snoring, like everything else in life, is an opportunity to go deeper into love.\"\n\nFrom Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip to reports that President Donald Trump and Melania Trump sleep separately, the decision to part at bedtime doesn't mean couples are in trouble, especially if they implement strategies to keep the relationship strong.\n\n\"The ones that work out very well are the ones that have done the work,\" Lankler said.\n\n'Ships in the night': For some, one bed may be better\n\nHowever, just because sleeping separately can help with restfulness and communication, it's not for everyone, said Sophie Jacobi-Parisi, a New York attorney at Warshaw Burstein who practices matrimonial and family law.\n\n\"It's very easy to be ships in the night when you're trying to live and work and raise kids,\" Jacobi-Parisi said. \"If you don't have any point of contact with your spouse ... it's very easy to lose any sort of sense that you are more than just a co-parenting, working team.\"\n\nFor couples that choose to sleep separately but don't have a conversation around why they are making the change, it can be another step in the path toward divorce, she added.\n\nDrink water when you wake up:Why you should drink water first thing every day\n\nIn some cases she sees, a couple may say they're sleeping separately for a specific reason – a child who can't sleep or a snoring problem – but then stay in two beds without ever revisiting why.\n\nSleeping together when it isn't working can also be a detriment, she said.\n\nIn one case she encountered, a couple shared a bed through their entire divorce proceedings in court. This can be challenging for children, who will get mixed signals, but Jacobi-Parisi said parents know their children best and must make a decision that's specific to them and how they'll react. Being honest with children about the decision is just as important as a spouse, she added.\n\nWhat about intimacy?\n\nA couple's sex life won't be ruined by sleeping apart any more than it would be by a TV in a shared bedroom, Lankler said.\n\nIn fact, sleeping in separate beds can create the opportunity to be more intentional about having a healthy sex life, she said. It can alleviate some of the pressure felt to be intimate when a bed is shared, too.\n\n\"You actually get to carve out time,\" Lankler said. \"You get to do it in a way that is intended and not sort of expected.\"\n\nJacobi-Parisi agreed, saying a concerted effort is needed not only for intimacy but also things like date night.\n\nContributing: Mary Bowerman\n\nEditor's note: A version of this story published in 2017.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/mouth-taping-tiktok-dangers-sleep-wellness/index.html", "title": "Mouth taping during sleep can be dangerous, experts say | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe social media platform TikTok has helped spread yet another potentially dangerous idea: taping your lips shut to stop mouth breathing at night.\n\n“If you have obstructive sleep apnea, yes, this can be very dangerous,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea, which is the complete or partial collapse of the airway, is one of the most common and dangerous sleep disorders: Over 1 billion people between the ages of 30 and 69 are thought to have the condition, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Millions more are undiagnosed, experts say.\n\n“There is limited evidence on the benefits of mouth taping and I would be very careful — and even talk to your health care provider before attempting it,” Dasgupta added.\n\nYet none of the TikTok videos CNN viewed mentioned the practice might be harmful in any way.\n\nOne young woman touts the benefits of beauty sleep as the reason to imprison her lips each night.\n\n“I tape my mouth shut every single day. … Sleeping properly is really important to anti-aging and looking and feeling your best.”\n\nDespite the downsides of painfully losing facial hair or damaging soft tissue around the mouth, another TikTok video recommends “regular old paper tape.”\n\n“I know there’s lots of fancy mouth-taping tapes on the market but you don’t need it. You just need this little square right here across the lip.”\n\nAll of this could be written off as silly, except one video appears to breed another as people pick up the challenge. One woman couldn’t even recall why she started taping her mouth at night:\n\n“Truth be told, I don’t know. I saw on TikTok and I can’t remember what the benefits were. But it helps me stay asleep!”\n\nDangers of mouth breathing\n\nAs with many things “discovered” by TikTok presenters, mouth taping isn’t new. People have been searching for years for ways to shut their mouth at night, and with good reason. Mouth breathing can lead to snoring and excessive thirst at night, as well as dry mouth and bad breath in the morning. Over time, breathing this way is linked to gum disease and malocclusion, where the upper and lower teeth don’t align.\n\nIn childhood, when the tendency to breathe via the mouth often starts, the condition can lead the child to develop a “mouth breathing face” — a narrowed face with receding chin or jaw, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Children are also at risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea, which has been linked to learning difficulties and behavioral problems in childhood.\n\nJournalist James Nestor allowed scientists to stop up his nose with silicone and surgical tape for 10 days in order to see just what mouth breathing would do to his health. As he described in his book “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,” the impact was shockingly fast. He developed obstructive sleep apnea, his blood pressure, pulse and heart rate shot up and his blood oxygen levels plummeted, sending his brain into a murky fog.\n\n“We had no idea it was going to be that bad,” Nestor told CNN in 2020. “The snoring and sleep apnea was so dramatic, and it came on so quickly, that everyone was pretty floored.”\n\nWhy nose breathing is best\n\nBreathing via the nostrils is healthier, experts say. Fine hairs in your nose called cilia filter out dust, allergens, germs and environmental debris. Nose breathing also moisturizes incoming air, while dry air breathed in through the mouth can irritate the lungs, Dasgupta said.\n\n“Nasal breathing may lower blood pressure by increasing nitride oxide, a compound in your body that can be helpful for keeping your blood pressure under control,” he added.\n\nIn addition, breathing through the nose is relaxing, which is why it is often recommended, along with yoga and meditation, as a way to promote sleep.\n\nCheck first for sleep apnea\n\nIf, however, you decide you do want to give mouth taping a try, don’t tape your mouth horizontally like you’re the hostage of a serial killer — even TikTok users stress that. Just a bit of tape placed vertically over the lips is supposed to work.\n\nOne small March study, however, found people who did that just replaced mouth breathing with “mouth puffing,” in which the research participants puffed air in and out of their mouths on each side of the tape.\n\nOverall, the “most important message” is to first be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea before you try sleeping with your mouth taped, Dasgupta said.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea has been linked to hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, even an early death. Max Pepper/CNN\n\n“Once obstructive sleep apnea is ruled out completely, then we can call it snoring,” he said. “Also, there are many other options to address snoring beside mouth taping such as nasal strips, nasal dilators and mouth (and) throat and tongue exercises.”\n\nAvoid sleeping on your back as well, a position that encourages the mouth to fall open and the tongue to fall back into the throat. Pushing air past that blockage is what causes snoring.\n\nMouth breathing is often linked to allergies, colds and chronic nasal congestion. A deviated septum, which is the cartilage that separates your nostrils can also be a cause — a crooked septum can block your airway. Nasal polyps can do the same, Dasgupta said.\n\nChildren may have enlarged adenoids, glands behind the nose that are designed to ward off bacteria and viruses. They shrink with age, so this is not a common cause of mouth breathing for adults, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAll of these underlying medical issues can be handled by a visit to an ear, nose and throat doctor or a sleep specialist who can create a personalized treatment plan for you.\n\n“These issues should be addressed and evaluated first before mouth taping. In my opinion taping your mouth shut is not likely to help you sleep better,” Dasgupta said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/01/10/ozy-5-shocking-statistics/21499925/", "title": "5 shocking statistics too profound to ignore", "text": "OZY editors\n\nOZY\n\nIdeas are abstract: What you know to be true today might be totally different than what you're told is true tomorrow.

Contemporarily, “at least in the US, about 20% to 30% of women retain their name, meaning the vast majority take their spouse’s name when they marry,” Carr said. That includes artist Jennifer Lopez, who recently confirmed her marriage to actor Ben Affleck with the signature “Mrs. Jennifer Lynn Affleck.”\n\n“Women may take their husband’s name legally,” Carr said, “but professionally, I would bet she will continue to perform under the name of J. Lo. Sometimes people take their husband’s name legally, but professionally, they may still use their maiden name.”\n\nIt wasn’t until legal changes and a booming feminist movement in the 1970s that there was a big push to keep one’s last name, Carr said. That tendency dipped during the 1980s, a more conservative era, and has fluctuated since the 1990s, she added.\n\nThe decision to retain or forgo one’s name can still be influenced by economic, familial, social, romantic and religious factors – especially when children are involved.\n\nBearing a new name\n\nFor some people, adopting a spouse’s name is a “public statement to the world that you are, in fact, a couple,” Carr said. “I think the other is social pressure. It may come from the spouse, but it might come from family. And women will often get pushback – whether from their parents or their in-laws – about why you’re not taking the name. Some people believe it means that you’re not as committed to the union.”\n\nInertia or tradition are other reasons, Carr said. “Some things have just always been done, and so people don’t question them. They don’t counter them,” Carr said. “It’s kind of the path of least resistance.”\n\nSome people might be keen to get rid of their family name because of a desire to somehow separate themselves from their biological parents, said Joshua Coleman, a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, California, and a senior fellow with the Council on Contemporary Families.\n\n“Somebody who wasn’t close to their parents or felt hurt by them (and) didn’t really like being identified as a Smith or a Jones or whomever, would welcome the idea of a new surname that wasn’t their own,” he added.\n\nWomen who believe in gender equality yet take on their husband’s name might think that the name change doesn’t mean they are ceding away any of their authority as a woman, Coleman said.\n\n“The woman doesn’t see herself in some kind of subordination to the husband or ceding any of her power or authority or identity or individuality. She likes the tradition of it, but that doesn’t mean that she buys into all of the things that may have gone with it traditionally,” he added.\n\nVery rarely does a husband adopt his wife’s surname. In a 2018 study of 877 men, 3% (27 men) had changed their name once married. Of those 27 men, 25 had dropped their last name entirely; two hyphenated their name. Men who changed their name in any form were more likely to be less educated.\n\n“That’s probably some kind of a persistence of misogyny or patriarchy or something in that camp – that the idea of a man taking on his wife’s last name would be somehow considered problematic,” Coleman said.\n\nThere isn’t much research about marriage-related name changes among couples on the LGBTQ+ spectrum.\n\n“I think part of the reason there isn’t that much data is because legal same sex marriage is still pretty new,” Carr said. “I suspect they may be more likely to hyphenate or to come up with something because of this egalitarianism that tends to happen – you don’t have this gendered history here.”\n\nRetaining identity\n\nAmong the 20% to 30% of women who don’t follow tradition, the most common practice is keeping their own surname, followed by hyphenation, making a hybrid name or, even more rarely, coming up with a totally new shared name, Carr said.\n\nFor some women, keeping their surname is preserving the personal and familial identity they have always had, Carr said. “That could be tied to their parents, tied to their ethnic or racial heritage – names are very meaningful.”\n\nPractically, some people have established a professional identity, especially those in very visible positions such as writers, academics or celebrities. If their name is key to their profession, that’s something they might not be willing to give up, she added.\n\nKeeping one’s surname can also be a political act, often done by those who adhere to feminist beliefs and practices, Carr said – such as independence and equal partnership. Some question why one name should take privilege over the other, and if using just one spouse’s name would convey an unequal partnership.\n\nThe prevalence of retaining one’s last name is greater among women with higher levels of education and older women, Carr said. “They have more professional identity built by that point,” she said, whereas younger women have fewer professional ties and might be more susceptible to family pressure.\n\nHaving children can complicate things.\n\n“It’s very rare that both partners would choose the woman’s name,” Carr said. “Overwhelmingly, if they choose one name, it’s the one that belongs to the husband.”\n\nMany believe that using one spouse’s last name is easier socially and legally, Carr said.\n\n“People know what to call you,” she said. Using one name can also prevent “administrative headaches” that can come up when it comes to things like booking flights, insurance, health care and who’s allowed to pick up a child from school, she added.\n\nParents who don’t use one surname for the entire family “have to do a lot more work and a lot of explanations,” Carr said, “because a lot of our structures are not set up to accommodate innovating naming practices.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe decision to use the husband’s name sometimes derives from the fact “that there’s maternal certainty,” Carr said. “We know who gives birth, but there’s not always paternal certainty. And given that nonmarital births are still stigmatized, I think, historically, that’s a reason why the couple would go with the male name.”\n\nCombining surnames in some fashion can be a way of preserving one’s identity as a member of their original family and as an individual, while also having an identity as a member of a new family, Coleman said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/health/memory-activation-sleep-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "You can learn to put names to faces while you sleep, study finds | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nNeed to quickly put a name to a face on a company video call? About to play charades online with your new partner’s entire family? Or are you fretting about putting a name to that colleague’s face when you do go back to work in person?\n\nOne day soon you may have a tool to help you quickly learn and retain names and faces, according to a new study published Wednesday in the journal NPJ: Science of Learning. Researchers from Northwestern University found playing a recording of people’s names during a night’s deepest sleep period reinforced peoples’ memories and improved their ability to recall names and faces the next morning.\n\n“Our study showed that when memories are reactivated during sleep, memory abilities can be improved after you wake up,” said senior author Ken Paller, a professor of psychology and director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University.\n\nIn fact, people were found to remember an average of one and a half more names than they did before they slept. But, Paller added, it only worked when “sleep was not disturbed at the time of memory reactivation.”\n\nStages of sleep\n\nIf you wake frequently due to noises or sleep apnea or to use the bathroom, that’s interrupting your sleep cycle – and depriving the body of the restorative sleep it needs.\n\nThe body’s sleep cycle moves though four stages of sleep four to six times each night. In stages 1 and 2, the body starts to decrease its rhythms. Heartbeat and breathing slow, body temperature drops, and eye movements stop. That prepares you for the next stage – a deep, slow-wave sleep, also known as delta sleep. During deep sleep, your body is literally restoring itself on a cellular level – fixing damage from the day’s wear and tear and consolidating memories into long-term storage.\n\nRapid eye movement sleep, called REM, comes next. This is the stage in which we dream. Studies have shown that missing REM sleep may lead to memory deficit and poor cognitive outcomes, as well as heart and other chronic diseases and an early death.\n\nSince each sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes long, most people need seven to eight hours of relatively uninterrupted slumber to achieve restorative sleep. A chronic lack of sleep impacts your ability to pay attention, learn new things, be creative, solve problems and make decisions.\n\nA wired nap\n\nPaller and his team asked a small group of 24 people to try to memorize pictures of 80 faces and corresponding names: Half of the images were said to be students from a Latin American history class; the other half were described as students in a Japanese history class.\n\nEach person was then wired to an EEG machine, which records the electrical activity of the brain, and allowed to take a daytime nap.\n\nDuring their snooze, the researchers carefully monitored brain activity. When brain waves showed that the person was in slow-wave or deep sleep, some of the names they had studied were played quietly on a speaker.\n\nMusic associated with either Japanese or Latin cultures was also played to help with association. Music has been shown to trigger the hippocampus, the part of your brain associated with long-term memory storage.\n\n“When our participants woke up, they were relatively better at recognizing people’s faces and remembering their names – compared to memory for faces and names not reactivated during sleep,” Paller said.\n\nPeople with longer periods of deep sleep, the study found, had the best memory recall.\n\nHowever, if the brain waves showed the person’s sleep had been disturbed during their nap, there was no improved recall on the test. That’s an important finding, said lead author Nathan Whitmore, a doctoral candidate in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program at Northwestern, in a statement.\n\n“It’s a new and exciting finding about sleep, because it tells us that the way information is reactivated during sleep to improve memory storage is linked with high-quality sleep,” Whitmore said.\n\nExciting enough to use it at home? Not quite yet, Paller said.\n\n“We are currently testing methods for implementing these procedures in the home,” he told CNN. “However, there isn’t enough evidence to be confident about how much of a gain is possible.”\n\nFuture studies should help discover “how these techniques could be used effectively,” he said. In the meantime, the key to a good memory is to get high-quality, uninterrupted sleep.\n\n“Through high-quality sleep, our memories are more likely to be available when we need them, so that we can use them to support decision-making, creativity and problem-solving,” Paller said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/01/29/domestic-violence-research-children-abuse-mental-health-learning-aces/2227218002/", "title": "The startling toll on children who witness domestic violence is just ...", "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. – Latrelle Huff says her twins were conceived by rape.\n\nNow she blames domestic violence for her children's health problems.\n\nThe Georgia woman says she had been in an abusive, on-and-off relationship for six years when she became pregnant. While pregnant, she says, the conflict continued. Huff spent 25 of 37 weeks on bed rest, she says, due in part to rectal bleeding her doctors said was caused by stress.\n\nTwo days after the twins were born in 2014, Huff says, the father took a swing at her. He was holding their newborn son. They were still in the hospital. Huff had just delivered by Cesarean section. \"He was so angry at me because my milk wouldn't come in,\" Huff, 39, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe boy was born with \"floppy baby syndrome,\" a muscular condition doctors said might be attributed to abuse during pregnancy. Both children struggle with health issues, including speech disorders, and have spent months in instructional therapy to learn how to follow directions.\n\nThe father denies sexually assaulting or abusing Huff. He was charged last year with assault and battery against her; his lawyer says he completed a pretrial program in September to avoid a conviction. In 2015, a grand jury in Savannah declined to indict him on sexual assault charges.\n\nNew research is giving scientists more insight into the far-reaching and long-lasting harms of domestic violence to the children who grow up around it – including a startling finding: Witnessing abuse carries the same risk of harm to children's mental health and learning as being abused directly.\n\nBrain imaging in infants shows that exposure to domestic violence – even as they are sleeping, or in utero – can reduce parts of the brain, change its overall structure and affect the way its circuits work together.\n\nStudies show that when babies born to mothers who were subjected to violence during pregnancy become adults, they have three times as much inflammation in their bodies as those whose mothers weren't. Inflammation causes a much higher risk of poor health, and a far greater likelihood of depression.\n\nAnd research also shows that these children are as likely to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as soldiers returning from war.\n\nPsychologist Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, past president of the American Psychological Association's division of trauma psychology, said \"babies are like a blank slate.\"\n\n\"If a mother is beaten while pregnant, there is a chance the baby will be injured, delivered prematurely, and there is a stack of other things that can happen – including physiological programming of the hyperactive stress system that leads to inflammation as an adult,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like when a soldier comes back from combat, hears a click and hits the ground.\"\n\nResearchers estimate that between 4.5 million and 15 million children are exposed to physical violence in the home. Verbal and emotional abuse in the home is more difficult to track.\n\nSocial workers, health care providers and academics have long tracked the effects of trauma suffered by children growing up in urban neighborhoods with frequent gunfire and other violence. But outside of medical journals, there has been little reporting on the effect of the more common domestic violence on the millions of children who grow up on the residential battlefields where it occurs.\n\nNeuroscientist Tanja Jovanovic directs the Grady Trauma Project, a research institute based at Emory University in Atlanta. The risk of PTSD from domestic violence is high, she says, because it's a \"betrayal by someone who is supposed to be to a protector.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Jovanovic said, domestic violence often eliminates the \"buffering effect of another positive adult,\" because the adult who is targeted can't provide comfort to the children who witness it.\n\nPsychologist Abigail Gewirtz says domestic violence can feel scarier than war. Gewirtz is the director of the Institute of Translational Research in Children's Mental Health at the University of Minnesota. It's \"one of the most terrifying forms of violence because it happens in a place which is supposed to be safe,\" she said. \"Children are totally powerless, especially very young children. They are totally dependent on their parents.”\n\nRead more:\n\nDomestic violence 'code of silence' contributes to prevalence across races, classes\n\n'Toxic stress' on children can harm their lifelong learning, mental and physical health\n\nExposure also reduces the potential of babies and toddlers to learn. Alissa Huth-Bocks, a child psychologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said the \"most damaging time\" is during pregnancy and the first three years of life, when development \"takes the biggest hit at the brain level.\"\n\nLong-lasting consequences\n\nNegative consequences continue well into adulthood. Among childhood adversities, Ronald Kessler says, those involving family violence inflict the worst long-term effects.\n\nKessler is a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the principal investigator of the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey – the first nationally representative survey of mental disorders in the United States. He is co-director of the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Survey Initiative.\n\n\"One of the long-term effects of childhood adversity is that they create emotional scars that get reopened when people are exposed to traumas in adulthood – leading to adult PTSD,\" Kessler said.\n\nFor people of color, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, the effects of trauma are often magnified, federally funded research shows, because they are more likely to suffer from systemic racism, discrimination and microaggressions.\n\nThe nonprofit research organization Child Trends reported last year that 6 percent of kids nationally – about 4.5 million children – had seen or heard parents or other adults slap, hit, kick or punch each other in the home. Four percent had been exposed to or victims of neighborhood violence.\n\nThe results were based on a survey of parents about their children. In five states – Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, Hawaii and Tennessee – at least 10 percent of children had been exposed to domestic violence at home.\n\nChild Trends says parents likely under-report violence in the home out of embarrassment or fear of stigma. The research doesn't include the psychological and emotional abuse, including gaslighting, that many women and some men told USA TODAY was far worse for them and their children to live with.\n\nThe findings, children's health advocates say, underscore a need for improved detection and prevention of domestic violence, and better treatment of abuse survivors and their children in the health care system, schools and the courts.\n\nGeorgia, Huff's home, is among the states where the law recognizes the effects of domestic violence on children. The state has created criminal charges for domestic violence that happens anywhere in a house where children are present, not just when it occurs in front of the child.\n\nIn other ways, specialists say, the law and courts have a long way to go in recognizing the impact on children's well-being. Parents accused or even convicted of domestic violence in many cases are able to gain unsupervised visits with their children, or partial or full partial custody – even when children are afraid of the offender.\n\nWhen parents in an abusive relationship separate, conditions for their children can become even riskier. The nonprofit group Center for Judicial Excellence, which monitors family courts, found that more than 650 children were killed by a parent in a \"divorce, separation, custody, visitation, child support situation\" from 2008 through 2018.\n\nDomestic violence crosses racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Cheryl Branch, executive director at Savannah's SAFE women's shelter, says the calls she gets from abused women in The Landings, an exclusive gated community, are as horrific as those that come from low-income clients.\n\nShe says women are afraid to leave husbands who threaten to spend whatever it takes to gain full custody of the children. When shelter residents go back to their domestic abusers – as many do – Branch is required to notify child protection authorities, just as she would be if a parent returned to someone who has sexually abused his or her child.\n\nHuth-Bocks, the Cleveland psychologist, says researchers' ability to study human brain development has \"exploded in the last five to six years.\" So has data on the mental health and addiction effects of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs – 10 harmful experiences or conditions, including domestic violence, tracked by health professionals.\n\nGenerations of violence\n\nIn San Diego, the children of now-divorced Eric and Yadira Sanchez – Angel, Noel and their 15-year-old brother – say they can vividly recall visiting their maternal grandparents' house when they were young.\n\nThey talk about seeing their grandmother punch cabinet doors and throw drinking glasses. She and their grandfather would hit each other in front of them, they say. The grandparents could not be reached for comment.\n\nLater, Angel and Noel say, they watched as their mother chased their father with a kitchen knife and smashed a piece of a wood across his back. In December 2011, police arrested Yadira Sanchez on charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and felony spousal battery, but prosecutors declined to pursue the charges.\n\nAs the alleged violence escalated, the children's grades and mental health declined, a review of school and medical records shows. (USA TODAY is not identifying the youngest son because he is a minor.)\n\n\"When these high levels of stress happen too often and too intensely, it creates a toxic pathway that alters how our brains and bodies operate and how we think, learn and behave,\" said psychologist Sheri Madigan, a professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nYadira Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, acknowledges that the boys were exposed to domestic violence. But he claims Eric Sanchez's efforts to separate the boys from their mother likely hurt them far more.\n\n\"This is not a case where physical violence was the primary factor,\" Marcus said.\n\nChange to brain, body\n\nResearchers who followed 1,420 children in North Carolina from age 9 to 30 found that exposure to domestic violence in the home had the same serious and life-changing effects as experiencing the abuse directly.\n\nThe American Medical Association published the study in November. University of Vermont psychologist William Copeland was its lead author. These children \"have the same type of poor outcomes 10, 20 years down the road\" as children who \"experience it directly themselves,\" he said.\n\nA global study out last year of more than 125,000 people from all socioeconomic backgrounds found children who witnessed domestic violence had the same risk and incidence of PTSD as soldiers returning from war.\n\nResearch presented in November at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies shows that children exposed at an early age to trauma, including domestic violence, have a smaller hippocampus – the brain area related to learning and memory formation – a risk factor for PTSD.\n\nOther research shows that the amygdala – the part of the brain that processes emotions, memory and fear – in children who have been exposed to violence reacts more strongly to threats than in children who haven't.\n\nEamon McCrory, a professor of developmental neuroscience at University College London, says the changes make it more difficult for these children to get along with others. Other studies have shown that exposing children to violence leads to lower grades and a greater probability of dropping out of school.\n\nPsychologist and professor Katie McLaughlin directs the Stress and Development Lab at Harvard. \"This change in size and likely the function of the hippocampus could be one potential mechanism that's underlying those differences in school achievement,\" she said. The brain works to help protect from danger. But when children are dealing with adversity, their brains can be overwhelmed.\n\nLearning disordered\n\nCatholic high schools around San Diego began scouting Angel Sanchez when he was in middle school, according to Phillip Lomax, his coach at the time. The strapping middle linebacker – he was 6-foot-tall and 225 pounds in high school – was hard to miss.\n\nProblem was, Sanchez said, just as his athletic abilities began gaining notice, his home life deteriorated and his grades dropped.\n\nHis mother stayed out late at night, his father found other men's numbers on her phone, and a pattern of erratic and often violent behavior against the boys and their father developed, Eric Sanchez said in requests for restraining orders and police reports.\n\nThe three boys each had an Individual Education Program detailing how they best learn given their disabilities. Angel has a speech impairment that affects his oral and written communication, reading comprehension and math problem solving. Noel was granted accommodations to receive extra time for homework and tests. The youngest boy struggles with reading and writing. All the boys were given intensive tutoring, language therapy and case managers.\n\nAs tensions between the parents rose, Angel's grade point average dropped from 3.0 at the beginning of his sixth grade to 1.3 by the start of 7th grade, school transcripts show.\n\nThat was the year – 2008 – that their mother chased their father around a table with a steak knife and stabbed the padded kitchen stools, Eric Sanchez and the boys told child welfare workers.\n\nNoel Sanchez, now 18, recalls that period. \"Oh man, I can still see and hear what happened those nights. That’s not going to go anywhere,\" he said.\n\nIn children exposed to domestic violence, the parts of the brain that detect threats and anticipate pain – the anterior insula and amygdala – are strongly affected by threatening faces during brain imaging.\n\nResearchers at University College London wrote in 2011 that the results might predict a later risk factor for anxiety disorders and increasing vulnerability to mental illness. A more recent study by the same authors showed this heightened responsiveness was present even when children weren't consciously aware of a threat.\n\n\"If you've grown up in a situation that's dangerous, you're much more likely to react to something that's actually totally safe (as if it were) a potential threat,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nThe two younger Sanchez boys went back and forth between their feuding parents. Angel stayed with his father. School progress reports show that Noel missed 57 classes in the first three months of 2017. His younger brother missed 137.\n\nIn 2016, Yadira Sanchez was granted a restraining order against Angel. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, says Angel kept trying to take his brothers away from their mother. Yadira lost custody of the boys in March 2017.\n\nLomax, the coach, says the chaos hurt Angel's future plans. \"If you’d asked me, when he was going into 9th grade, what Angel’s potential as a linebacker was, he was certainly a Division I contender, for sure,\" he said.\n\nEric Sanchez, the father, says one high school withdrew a scholarship offer after it saw Angel's grades. He missed practice often during high school during the parents' custody fight.\n\nNoel Sanchez says that the turmoil before their parents separated, and stays with their mother after the split, were so traumatic that he attempted suicide in 2014 and considered it at other times. \"I was just trying to hurt myself to let the pain go away,\" he said.\n\nMore:Surviving Suicide Q&A: Laura answers your questions on loss, depression, the hard stuff\n\nMore:After a suicide, here’s what happens to the people left behind\n\nFrom mother to daughter\n\nDebbie Ricker says domestic violence looms over three generations of her family. Both the California woman and her daughter Desiree say it led to Desiree's drug and alcohol abuse, and other mental and physical health struggles.\n\nRicker fought a 15-year custody battle with her ex-husband. It ended only when her son turned 18. She says the emotional abuse she suffered and her children witnessed still affects them. \"My ex was very open with his abuse toward me,\" she said. \"The abuse occurred in front of our kids, friends, family.\"\n\nDesiree, now 29, said \"I never heard him be nice to her. He belittled her every step of the way.\"\n\nMarc Loehren, Debbie Ricker's ex-husband and Desiree's father, denies their allegations. He was never charged with a crime against them. “My two children had a wonderful childhood,\" he told USA TODAY. \"There was no violence in this household. ... if anything, the mom hit me with a car.”\n\nHe acknowledges the children have been to multiple psychologists. But he cites Ricker's family background and marriages before and after their relationship. He alleges that Ricker tried to undermine his relationship with the children.\n\n\"The children are fairly disturbed from anything that the mom has told them – which is alienation,\" Loehren said.\n\nDuring an interview for a family evaluation during the custody fight, Loehren said Ricker was scaring the children by calling the police when he allegedly violated restraining orders.\n\nBased on the evaluator's recommendation, a family court judge ordered the parents into joint counseling. The judge said each had to educate themselves on \"child development and high parental conflict.\"\n\nRicker, 62, says she asked for a divorce. She says Loehren suggested the two of them sit down and explain it to the children. She says he opened he conversation by saying \"Mommy doesn't like daddy anymore, so she is breaking our family apart.\" The kids started screaming and crying, Ricker says. Then they started to hit her.\n\nDesiree started to gain weight when she was about 5. A therapist would later attribute the weight gain to the family dysfunction. When Desiree was 12, the family doctor told Ricker that her daughter had pre-diabetes. \"It just made me cry,\" Ricker says.\n\nIn high school, Desiree says, she gained about 100 pounds – weight she still carries. At 12, Desiree says, she began an abusive relationship with a boyfriend who also came from a violent home. It lasted, on and off, until she was 27. The ex-boyfriend was never charged with abusing her.\n\nStudies show that childhood adversities can lead to obesity later in life. Duke University researchers reported last year that children aged 12 to 15 were far more likely to eat poorly and less likely to get physical activity after exposure to domestic violence.\n\n'These things go together'\n\nIt's common for children who are exposed to domestic violence to also suffer other adverse childhood experiences. ACEs are linked to a range of mental and physical health consequences throughout life, up to and including early death.\n\n“If there's domestic violence in the household, it's statistically likely that there's also physical abuse and emotional abuse and maybe drug abuse or alcohol abuse,\" said Canan Karatekin, a professor of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota. \"These things go together.”\n\nHuff took on the role of protector of her younger siblings. It carried its own burden.\n\nDuring the summer before fifth grade, she says, she remembers holding one of her sisters in her lap as another was rushed to the hospital after the first of several suicide attempts. \"I had to grow up fast and be a second mom to my siblings,\" she says. \"It made me stronger. ... I was determined not to be like my sister or my mother.\"\n\nBut that was nearly impossible.\n\nHuff and her mother say domestic violence spans generations in their family.\n\nDenise Boyd was caring for a year-old daughter while she was pregnant with Huff at 21. Boyd was having a breakdown, she says, after years living with the abusive father of her children.\n\nThe father could not be reached for comment. He was never charged with a crime against Boyd.\n\nBoyd's mother went to take her home to Georgia. Once in her parents' home, Boyd says, she rarely went out. On rare occasions when she did, she would hide on the floor of the family car. \"I felt like I wasn’t the same anymore,\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n\nHuff was born in August 1979. As a little girl, she developed a speech disorder. In eighth grade, Huff says, she was so anxious she tried to run away. She was sent briefly to a juvenile detention facility.\n\nDavid Murphey, director of the Child Trends DataBank, describes domestic violence as a type of toxic stress linked to health problems later in life. Domestic violence rewires the brain, he said, harming executive function – \"the ability to weigh options and make well-considered choices.\"\n\nHow can communities best address abuse?\n\nDetecting, treating and preventing exposure to domestic abuse are the keys to reducing it, specialists say.\n\nCertified nurse midwife Pamela Glenn, field education supervisor at Minneapolis's Walden University School of Nursing, has screened her patients for abuse for 30 years.\n\nShe says health care professionals should create a safe space for patients, don't judge or blame, and avoid using the word \"abuse.\"\n\n“Most people, when they hear the word 'abuse,' they automatically think physical violence,\" Glenn said. \"The abuse may be emotional abuse only – but that can be extremely damaging to people's health.”\n\nShe asks questions such as “Does your partner support you?\" And \"Do you ever find that your partner is constantly checking up on you when you're not together and almost interrogating you at times?\" If she suspects abuse, she says, she offers resources such as information for an advocate or safe place.\n\nSpecialists say screening alone is not enough. \"Screening is the great first step, but it's only a first step,\" said Jess Bartlett, a trauma researcher with Child Trends. \"Too often we look at what kids have experienced, but not how they function.\" She says health care providers should look at children's needs, and whether the community has the resources to respond.\n\nMurphey agrees. “Unless there are adequate networks of services and referral practices to follow the results up,\" he said, \"what you're doing is you're really setting up an unfortunate situation where you know you've got lots of problems but you don't have services in place yet to respond to them.”\n\nWith treatment, researchers wrote in a report for the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, children exposed to early trauma including domestic violence can overcome the experiences without developing stress-related disorders.\n\nOften the support of parents, friends, family and school can help alleviate the effects of stress and trauma in children, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\n\n\"A strong relationship with a caring, nonviolent parent is one of the most important factors in helping children grow in a positive way despite their experiences,\" the group wrote in a 2014 report.\n\nBut Huth-Bocks said the parents she works with are often \"preoccupied keeping everyone alive and can't always be the most sensitive parent.\n\n\"There’s bigger fish to fry.\"\n\n'Pure chaos'\n\nHuff says it was a violent world that her twins entered in July 2014.\n\nShe says the father was holding the boy two days after their birth when he took a swing at her. The girl was the crib behind Huff, she says. She says she had to hold onto the crib to keep it from falling.\n\nThe father, Ignacio Ramirez Vallejo, denies her account. \"It never happened,\" he told USA TODAY. He was not charged in the alleged incident. “I’ve been in court many times,\" he said. \"Latrelle tried to accuse me for many different things. We were together almost seven years. They never find me guilty.”\n\nRamirez Vallejo says he did not sexually assault Huff.\n\nHis lawyer, A.J. Balbo, gave USA TODAY copies of letters he says Huff wrote to Ramirez Vallejo two years before the twins' birth saying she wanted to have children with him. “Everything they say about me is not true,\" Ignacio Ramirez said. \"I’m a Christian.”\n\nJeanne Fell, a nurse practitioner who specializes in neurology and has treated Huff's twins, says the pregnancy was about as complicated as they come. Huff had severe vomiting during much of the pregnancy and required intravenous medication. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks. A typical pregnancy lasts 40.\n\n\"It's been pure chaos since these kids have been born,\" Fell said. \"She does her very best, but certainly there are limits to how much she can give of herself to the children.\"\n\nBoth babies were poor eaters, Fell says. The boy had hyptonia, or floppy baby syndrome, which can be caused by nerve or brain damage. He's now on a powerful antipsychotic drug to help with aggression or and self injury, a review of his medical records show. Fell said he's \"done really well and is much more calm,\" but if he goes off the drug, she said, he hits others and tries to escape.\n\nHuff has been getting reports from her daughter's school, including one reviewed by USA TODAY from October in which she was described as \"extra tearful today\" and accused of \"mooning\" several other children.\n\nNeither child sleeps more than five hours a night, Huff says. Before he started on his current medication, Huff's son rarely slept more than three hours.\n\nHuff has a master's degree in mental health counseling and is pursuing a second master's in social work. She recently lost her job as an armed security guard after missing work to attend to her children's health appointments She's now looking for a job in mental health case work.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant, Ramirez-Vallejo was apprehended in Savannah not long after President Donald Trump took office, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman said. His case is pending in immigration court. He has argued he should be allowed to stay in this country because he has children here. He sees the children every other weekend for two full days, but is not allowed to spend the night with them.\n\nHuff says she tries to focus on the future.\n\n\"My dream is for my children to not grow up in a dysfunctional family, as I did and as their father did,\" she said. \"I want both children to feel safe and to be able to grow in an environment where they will be successful, stable and happy.\n\n\"The new generation needs an opportunity to live life without continuing the cycle.\"\n\nIf you or your child is experiencing domestic violence and/or mental health problems:\n\nContact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or online\n\nContact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255\n\nVisit the National Child Traumatic Stress Network to learn about resources and treatment.\n\nReporting for this article was supported by the Fund for Journalism on Child Well-Being, a program of the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism.\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with issues mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY’s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/health/mental-tricks-for-sleep-wellness/index.html", "title": "How to fall asleep faster with these mental tricks to calm your mind ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou’re exhausted, your body yawning for sleep. Yet once your head hits the pillow, your mind is flooded with worry, making sleep elusive, at times impossible.\n\nDon’t fret, experts say: There are relaxation techniques you can use to calm that racing mind.\n\n“Think of these relaxation exercises as tools in your tool kit for better sleep,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School.\n\n“Practice them, and you’ll get better and better at falling asleep, which is the holy grail, right? No one wants to spend time tossing and turning at night.”\n\n1. Controlled deep breathing\n\nDeep breathing is a science-backed method of calming the body and mind that can be done easily before you get into bed and when you wake during the middle of the night.\n\nChanging the rhythm of your breath slows your heart rate, reduces blood pressure and stimulates the body’s parasympathetic “rest and digest” system, which can take worry and anxiety offline.\n\n“Consciously focusing on the breath can help you separate yourself from the darting thoughts that fly through your brain,” Robbins said.\n\nThere are a number of deep breathing techniques you can try. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, focuses on relaxing the diaphragm, the main muscle of respiration. Start by taking a deep breath through your nose to a slow count of six, making sure that you can feel your stomach rise with your hand as it fills with air. Count to six again as you let the breath slowly escape.\n\n“Strive for effortless inhales that are soft and soundless while treating your exhales like gentle, extended sighs of relief,” suggested CNN contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach.\n\nStay in the moment, Santas said, by focusing on the sounds and sensations of your breath: “Direct all of your senses to follow the path of air in through your nose, down your throat, into your lungs and out again. If your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath, happening in the here and now.”\n\n2. Meditation\n\nMeditation is a centuries-old method of calming the body and the mind. Studies show it can help perfectionists stop judging themselves and can assist in the treatment of smoking, pain, addictive disorders and depression, among others.\n\nUsing direct measures of brain function and structure, one study found it only took 30 minutes a day of meditation practice over the course of two weeks to produce a measurable change in the brain.\n\n“When these kinds of mental exercises are taught to people, it actually changes the function and the structure of their brain,” neuroscientist Richard Davidson, professor of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\nThere are many resources on the internet to help someone begin to meditate. Davidson and his colleagues have created a free, science-based app designed to help people practice meditation and mindfulness.\n\n3. Visualization\n\nVisualization is another sleep aid. Picture a calm and peaceful spot in your mind’s eye and fill it with specific objects, colors and sounds. Researchers have found that people who visualize in detail were able to push unwelcome thoughts more successfully from their minds.\n\nIf you have trouble populating the scene, the researchers suggest asking yourself questions about smell, touch and light, such as “Can I feel the sun on my skin? What do I smell in the air?”\n\nYou can also visualize your body relaxing, experts say. While breathing deeply and slowly, imagine your breath is a wind coursing through the body, easing stress and relaxing tension as it moves through each part of the body and then escapes.\n\n“I like to think of the breath as a light in your mind’s eye that grows when you inhale and gets smaller as you exhale,” Robbins said. “Those tangible strategies where you visualize something and match that to a breath are really powerful.”\n\n4. Progressive muscle relaxation\n\nMost of us aren’t even aware of how much tension we carry in our muscles until it shows up in backaches and headaches.\n\nProgressive muscle relaxation is a way of relaxing those muscles, thus making it easier to fall asleep, experts say. You tense and release muscle groups in the body in a certain order, starting at the head and working your way down to the toes and feet.\n\nEach section of the body is tightly tensed and held for 10 seconds as you breathe in. Strive to squeeze each muscle hard, but not to the point of cramping or pain. Then, as you breathe out, relax the muscle suddenly and all at once. University of Michigan Health recommends you do the exercises in a systematic order that you can find here.\n\nThere’s an added benefit to the exercise, experts say: There’s no room in your brain for anxious thoughts.\n\n5. Set up a ‘worry time’ before bed\n\nHere’s a way to stop your mind from repetitively listing all the things you need to do (or haven’t done), but it only works if you do it before you hit the sack.\n\n“Don’t worry in bed. Schedule a ‘worry time’ – a period of time outside of the bedroom, outside of sleep, to worry about the things that naturally creep in your mind at night,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n“Write down a list of things you need to do tomorrow,” suggested Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, a professor of medicine and director of sleep research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n“You can even email it to yourself.

Or about divvying up money or assets after a marriage ends.\n\nBut more brides- and grooms-to-be are considering that scenario, especially when it comes to prenuptial agreements.\n\nPrenups are often met with preconceived notions of a lack of trust or a way to protect riches when the partners’ wealth is imbalanced. But divorce lawyers and financial planners argue that prenups are a way to clarify financial matters and open up communication before wedding vows are exchanged.\n\nThese agreements are not just for the wealthy and powerful – 62% of divorce attorneys said they saw an increase in clients requesting a prenup, with a significant uptick in millennials signing them, according to a 2019 study by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers.\n\nHere’s a rundown of prenuptial agreements and why you might need one.\n\nThe basics\n\nA prenuptial agreement outlines certain property rights and financial assets that each person holds before they marry, and lays out how those assets are to be divided in the event of a split. If a prenuptial agreement is in place, it supersedes the divorce laws of the couple’s state.\n\n“Basically, it’s a divorce settlement that you arrive at before you actually get married,” said David Storobin, an attorney and former New York state senator. “So the advantage of doing it is that you have some goodwill at that point.”\n\nThese agreements cover financial matters only: children are off-limits. Though kids can be financially provided for in a prenup, couples cannot change child support or custody.\n\nRules outlining prenuptial agreements can vary from state to state. Some states require each person to have their own counsel, while other states are less restrictive and parties can enter into a notarized agreement without an attorney.\n\nThey can also vary in cost, ranging from about $1,500 to nearing $10,000 in more complicated cases.\n\nDivorce attorneys caution that putting a prenup together should not be a task left to the week of the wedding. Three to six months before the wedding date is a good window in which to complete one because they can take time.\n\n“When couples start planning it a month or two before their wedding date, it winds up being slow because it takes a backseat to the wedding cake and flowers,” Storobin said.\n\nNot just for the rich\n\nWhile a prenup may be a no-brainer for wealthier people, attorneys said they can also work for couples who may not have accumulated many assets – such as those who want to protect a business they own or just want to outline finances before a marriage.\n\nIn general, prenups can be helpful for couples in which there is an existing wealth imbalance – or there might be one later on. Even if people aren’t wealthy now, some clients have reason to believe they will be – for example if they’re in medical school, or expect an inheritance.\n\nStorobin said he’s increasingly seeing middle class clients seeking prenups. Often they don’t want to lose half of what they have or lose a specific asset, like a small business, should they get divorced.\n\nJulia Rodgers, the CEO and founder of HelloPrenup, an online platform for creating prenuptial agreements, said the agreements can be beneficial to both sides, not just the spouse who is wealthier.\n\n“If one party is very, very wealthy, and the other is not, there are mechanisms that you can put in place to make sure that there is some financial equality in the marriage,” Rodgers said.\n\nThat’s one reason prenups are becoming more popular among younger people, said Rodgers. The vast majority of users of HelloPrenup are millennials – the average age of site users is 34, she said.\n\nWomen especially have an “incredible earning potential” compared to previous generations, Rodgers said.\n\n“The reality is that people, millennials specifically, are entering marriages as a partnership,” she said. “So they don’t have this 1950s style expectation that one person’s going to work and the other is going to stay at home.”\n\nAnd the ongoing pandemic also has many younger people realizing their savings and assets aren’t as stable as they thought.\n\nBringing up a difficult subject\n\nWhile it’s not an easy discussion, Rodgers advised bringing up prenuptials early on – ideally before getting engaged, even if it’s just hypothetical. That way both people are prepared for the discussion when the time comes.\n\n“You walk into the engagement with this expectation and understanding that this is something you’re going to talk further about,” Rodgers said.\n\nIt’s not about trust, she said, but rather fears surrounding divorce – especially for younger couples. Only 62% of millennials were raised by both parents, according to Pew Research Center, a lower percentage than previous generations. And it’s important to have open and honest conversations about these fears, both with yourself and your partner.\n\n“Is it because your parents went through a messy divorce?” Rodgers said. “Would this help make you feel really comfortable and give some sense of clarity with finances?”\n\nThe most difficult conversations to have in a relationship can be about money, Rodgers said. But it shouldn’t be taboo.\n\n“Just as much as a legal document, it is an emotional document,” Rodgers said. “So a prenup can really help facilitate those conversations about money.”", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}]}

While national numbers largely remained stagnant since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the data showed Arizona’s homelessness crisis worsened significantly.\n\nHomelessness across the country increased by less than 1% between 2020 and 2022, the report showed. Yet Arizona saw a 23% jump in its homeless population.\n\nOf the more than 13,000 people experiencing homelessness in Arizona, most were unsheltered, meaning they were living on the street, in a car or in another place not meant for sleeping.\n\nArizona was one of just four states where more than two-thirds of unaccompanied youth under age 25 did not have a place to sleep.\n\nArizona is likely an outlier because of its dire shortage of affordable housing, said Tom Simplot, director of the Arizona Department of Housing. While the state has experienced immense population growth in the past two years, its housing supply hasn’t kept up.\n\n“We can have all the money we could possibly use. We could have all the vouchers we could possibly use. But if we don’t have the units to actually house people, that money is basically worthless,” Simplot said.\n\nJoanna Carr, research and policy director for the Arizona Housing Coalition, agreed.\n\n“Essentially, housing and homelessness are connected,” Carr said. “And it’s the huge demands in our housing market that are contributing to homelessness.”\n\nThe HUD report's data was collected by local planning entities that count the number of people experiencing homelessness in their community on a single night every year. Experts agree that the numbers are likely a significant undercount because weather, volunteer availability and other factors can make it hard to get a complete count.\n\nCleaning 'the Zone':Phoenix resumes cleanups of downtown homeless camp, gets people into shelter\n\nBecause Pima County used a different methodology in 2022 to count its homeless population, its numbers last year were inflated compared with other places. This partially skewed Arizona’s population count, though most of the state’s homeless population was concentrated in Maricopa County, not Pima County.\n\nOn the same day HUD released its report, the Biden administration announced plans to reduce homelessness by 25% by 2025. The multi-pronged strategy includes increasing the supply of permanent supportive housing and emergency shelter space, providing more employment and education opportunities and expanding access to federal funding for Native American communities.\n\nArizona's affordable housing efforts fall short\n\nExperts agree: More needs to be done — and fast — to address the state’s rapidly growing affordable housing and homelessness crisis.\n\nThe state has recently made major investments to address the crisis, including converting seven hotels and motels to emergency shelters, funneling resources to rural communities and continuing to issue tax credits to affordable housing developers, said Simplot of the Arizona Department of Housing.\n\nStill, he said efforts to build more affordable housing need to be considerably ramped up, as the state isn’t keeping pace with its population growth. There are 375,000 Arizonans with an annual income of $25,000 or less, meaning they can afford to pay only $625 per month for rent and utilities without being cost-burdened, according to the department's research.\n\n“I can tell you right now, there are zero apartments available in Arizona at that level,” Simplot said.\n\nMore policy solutions are needed to curb the crisis, such as changing zoning laws to make it easier to build more homes and somehow regulating rent increases, said Carr of the Arizona Housing Coalition.\n\nIn November, Gov. Katie Hobbs released a plan to mitigate the housing crisis. The plan includes encouraging local zoning changes, providing legal aid to families facing eviction and investing in the Housing Trust Fund, which funds affordable housing development and assistance programs, among other strategies.\n\nDespite the pandemic, national homelessness numbers hold steady\n\nThe somewhat good news: The number of people experiencing homelessness nationwide increased by less than 1% between 2020 and 2022, despite the widespread economic hardship brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic that many experts predicted would cause homelessness to spike.\n\nIn a statement, HUD attributed the absence of a spike to the “robust federal response” that helped keep people in their homes during the pandemic, including emergency rental assistance, the Child Tax Credit and stimulus payments.\n\nThe national inventory of shelter beds also increased between 2020 and 2022, the report said.\n\nSeveral demographic groups, including veterans, families with children and unaccompanied youth, saw significant nationwide decreases in homelessness over the past two years.\n\nBut homelessness rose among other groups, including Hispanic or Latino people, people who identify as Native American or Pacific Islander, single individuals and people with disabilities who are chronically homeless.\n\nThe number of Black people experiencing homelessness decreased by 5% between 2020 and 2022, though Black people, along with Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, were still overrepresented among the country’s homeless population.\n\nHUD calculated changes over two years — 2020 to 2022 — because many communities did not count the number of unsheltered people in 2021 due to pandemic safety precautions.\n\nVolunteers are needed to help with this year’s point-in-time count on Jan. 25. Every county has a point-in-time count administrator. The Maricopa Association of Governments website provides information on who to contact to volunteer in Maricopa County.

The recovery could take years, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Pakistan has said. And chances are any recovery will be interrupted by yet another disaster.\n\n“We consistently see climate devastation in the forms of floods, monsoons, extensive droughts, extreme heat waves,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said in an interview with CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Tuesday.\n\n“And frankly, the people of Pakistan, the citizens of Pakistan, are paying the price in their lives, their livelihoods for the industrialization of rich countries that has resulted in this climate change.”\n\nThe stark inequity of the climate crisis, which is bearing down hardest on nations that have historically had the least to do with causing it, is raising questions over who should pay for it, particularly for the damage that countries like Pakistan are coming to terms with.\n\nMaxar Technologies Maxar Technologies Gudpur, Pakistan Satellite image ©2022MaxarTechnologies\n\nThe United Nations issued an appeal for $160 million in emergency funds on Tuesday, barely enough to scratch the surface of the $10 billion needed. Countries from the United States to Turkey are pitching in with aid, rescue helicopters, food and medical supplies. Yet the need is greater than what the world is giving.\n\nThese devastating scenes and eye-watering recovery costs are what the climate crisis looks like at 1.2 degrees Celsius of global warming since industrialization.\n\nBut the world is on track for warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius, analyses show, and scientists warn every fraction of a degree of warming will worsen the impacts of the crisis.\n\nPlanet Labs Planet Labs Hala, Pakistan Planet Labs\n\nFahad Saeed, a climate scientist with the group Climate Analytics, who is based in Islamabad, told CNN that Pakistan was in a Catch-22 situation. The country needs money to adapt to the crisis, yet because it has to pay for the damage that extreme weather is already causing it will struggle to find the funds it needs to adjust.\n\n“What is happening right now at 1.2 degrees centigrade of warming is not because of the poor people in Pakistan,” he said. “They are not responsible for it, and this brings out the issue of climate justice in a very clear form.”\n\nHe added that Pakistan, like so many developing nations, needed to bring more people out of poverty, a difficult thing to do in the midst of back-to-back extreme weather events with such little financial support from abroad.\n\nSaeed said Pakistan was in “a position to present a strong case” at the COP27 international climate talks in Egypt this November that other nations should help it pay to pick up the pieces.

It’s nearly impossible to find a spot to spread your beach blanket at Coney Island in the summer, and the long wait to cross the George Washington bridge connecting Manhattan with the borough of Fort Lee in New Jersey should be a crime.\n\nBut take a look at the crowds from another perspective: In the United States, we don’t actually know anything about real overcrowding – not a single American city ranks among the top 50 most densely populated urban areas in the world. At the other end of the spectrum, these are the least densely populated places in the world.\n\nA variety of factors help explain the high density of these cities, where it seems impossible to walk without bumping into pedestrians every second: more births than deaths, people moving to cities for jobs or forced off rural land by natural disasters, skyrocketing land prices, to name a few.\n\nPopulation density is determined by the number of residents who live within a given land area – usually a mile or kilometer. According to the United Nations, as of 2016, about 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas. This is expected to grow to 60% by 2030, with one in three people living in cosmopolises with at least 500,000 residents – maybe in some of the world’s 33 megacities.\n\nIn time for the World Population Day, marked every year on July 11 to raise awareness about urgent population issues, 24/7 Tempo identified the most densely populated cities in the world, using data from CityMayors Statistics, a global source for urban statistics.\n\nAmerican health:Average life expectancy in the US has been declining for 3 consecutive years\n\n50.

Construction and manufacturing surged in the state in 2018, and foreign direct investment (FDI) increased 127% over the previous year. The local unemployment rate hovers around 3.5%. But Monterrey isn't all work and no play – the city currently features a lively nightlife, plus outdoor activities and cultural institutions, and the World Cup is on the schedule for 2024.\n\n35. Khartoum, Sudan\n\n• Population density: 17,770 per square mile\n\n• Population: 4,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 225 miles\n\nKhartoum is the capital of Sudan. Political unrest is rampant in this northeastern African nation. Last spring, the military ousted autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir, and since then, Khartoum has been the site of often-violent demonstrations, with at least 11 people killed during June 30 protests this summer. American travelers are urged to stay away from the area because of terrorism and civil unrest.\n\n34. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\n• Population density: 17,704 per square mile\n\n• Population: 10,800,000\n\n• Square miles: 610 miles\n\nThough capital cities are often a country's most densely populated area, that's not the case in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro regularly attracts attention for special events such as the recent Copa America tournament and the annual carnival celebration, believed to be the biggest in the world. Though tourism plays an important role in the city's economy, oil, agriculture, banking, fishing and finance are all major industries as well.\n\n33. Dalian, China\n\n• Population density: 18,310 per square mile\n\n• Population: 2,750,000\n\n• Square miles: 150 miles\n\nAll eyes were on Dalian at the start of July, as the northeastern China city hosted the 2019 World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions, or Summer Davos Forum. This is the seventh time the forum has been held in Dalian since 2007. The forum, which typically draws about 2,000 participants from around the world, has elevated the city's profile internationally, and spurred infrastructure development, including new roads and building reconstruction. Dalian aims to increase its importance as an international trading center.\n\n32.

Punjabi, Urdu and English are the most commonly spoken languages in Lahore. The metropolis is the nation's engineering hub, producing cars, heavy machinery, steel, chemicals and more. Industry, traffic, crop burning and solid waste disposal all contribute to making this regional capital one of the world's most polluted cities.\n\n29. Singapore\n\n• Population density: 21,628 per square mile\n\n• Population: 4,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 185 miles\n\nOften referred to as an economic tiger, Singapore, an island city-state, boasts a high gross domestic product per capita, low unemployment, and thriving electronics and pharmaceutical industries. The city often has superlatives linked with its name: It's among the most expensive city in the world (it's a three-way tie with Paris and Hong Kong), the world's most competitive economy, and – perhaps surprisingly, in such a high-rise environment – the city with the most trees, to name just a few of its attributes.\n\n28. Santiago, Chile\n\n• Population density: 21,683 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,425,000\n\n• Square miles: 250 miles\n\nOn a clear day, you have a good view of the Andes Mountains from Santiago, Chile's capital city. The fourth most densely populated city in South America is also home to the continent's tallest building, the Gran Torre Santiago, standing almost 1,000 feet high. The city has the country's greatest concentration of industry, which includes clothing, shoe and textile manufacturing; banking and a stock exchange; and mining and metallurgy.\n\n27. Mexico City, Mexico\n\n• Population density: 21,750 per square mile\n\n• Population: 17,400,000\n\n• Square miles: 800 miles\n\nMexico City, situated more 7,300 feet above sea level, is North America's highest capital city, as well as its most densely populated metropolitan area. It is also the world's largest Spanish-speaking city, and one of the largest financial centers on the continent. Mexico City has a large immigrant and expatriate population from the around the globe, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Caribbean and elsewhere. Warm weather, good food and a lower cost of living are among the attractions.\n\n26. St Petersburg, Russia\n\n• Population density: 22,069 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,300,000\n\n• Square miles: 240 miles\n\nLocated just below the Arctic Circle in the far northwest, St. Petersburg served as the capital of the Russian Empire for more than two centuries, until Moscow took over the honors in 1918. St. Petersburg remains a huge and important city 100 years post the Bolshevik revolution, and its historical district was named a UNESCO world heritage site in 1990. In addition to its major Baltic Sea port, the city is known as a Russian cultural center teeming with theaters, concert halls, palaces and museums, and architectural wonders. The Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines is a unique venue, featuring vending machines and games that were the Soviet equivalent of Pac-Man, with an ideological component.\n\n25. São Paulo, Brazil\n\n• Population density: 23,294 per square mile\n\n• Population: 17,700,000\n\n• Square miles: 760 miles\n\nSão Paulo is Brazil's most densely populated area, one of the most crowded metro areas in the Southern Hemisphere, and the world's largest Portuguese-speaking city. The capital of the state of the same name, São Paulo is the financial capital of Brazil. It is also a major export center, dealing in products such as soybean, coffee, raw sugar and corn.\n\n24. Hyderabad, India\n\n• Population density: 23,545 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,300,000\n\n• Square miles: 225 miles\n\nIn a 2018 report, Hyderabad was credited with having the highest gross domestic product growth among 20 cities in emerging Asia-Pacific nations. The city, which is the capital of the state of Telangana, was rated second among nine Indian cities for employment growth rate over two years. For the fourth straight year, Hyderabad was named India's top city for standard of living.\n\n23. Shenyang, China\n\n• Population density: 24,013 per square mile\n\n• Population: 4,200,000\n\n• Square miles: 175 miles\n\nThis northeastern Chinese industrial city is located a little more than 300 miles from the North Korea border. The capital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang's main products include cars and auto parts, construction materials, chemicals, steel and agricultural products. Unlike Northeast China's other provincial capital cities, Shenyang's population has grown in recent years, with the increase attributed to job seekers, increased college enrollment and more families having second children.\n\n22. Baghdad, Iraq\n\n• Population density: 23,901 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,500,000\n\n• Square miles: 230 miles\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Islamic State last year, Baghdad residents reported that life was starting to feel somewhat safe and normal. People who had fled during more than a decade of war and upheaval began returning to their hometown, the capital of Iraq. The economy in Iraq had been picking up in recent months.\n\n21. Cairo, Egypt\n\n• Population density: 24,400 per square mile\n\n• Population: 12,200,000\n\n• Square miles: 500 miles\n\nCairo is among the most densely populated cities in Africa, with its ongoing growth attributed to the disparity between the annual birth rate (30 births per 1,000 people) and death rate (7 deaths per 1,000 people). Egypt's capital city has such a perennial housing shortage that for decades residents have occupied every viable bit of space, including among the above-ground tombs in the el-Arafa necropolis, also known as the City of the Dead.\n\nA car for Nazis and hippies alike:Say goodbye to the Volkswagen Beetle\n\n20. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\n• Population density: 24,500 per square mile\n\n• Population: 4,900,000\n\n• Square miles: 200 miles\n\nHo Chi Minh City's population is more than double the population of Hanoi, Vietnam's capital and the next largest city. Migrants are attracted to the city for job opportunities in manufacturing, business and tourism, and by the per capita gross domestic product, which is twice as high as the national average in 2016. The country is investing in infrastructure improvements, such as Ho Chi Minh's metro rapid transit network, to help Vietnam preserve its status as one of the world's fastest growing tourist destinations.\n\n19. Bangalore, India\n\n• Population density: 26,191 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,400,000\n\n• Square miles: 206 miles\n\nBangalore is one of the world's least expensive cities. Nevertheless, it's standard of living was rated among the best in India in a recent report, which may explain why much of the population growth in Bangalore is due to migration from other Indian states. The capital of the state of Karnataka, Bangalore is home to many tech companies, earning it the nickname of the Silicon Valley of India.\n\n18. Tianjin, China\n\n• Population density: 27,158 per square mile\n\n• Population: 4,750,000\n\n• Square miles: 175 miles\n\nChina's largest coastal city, Tianjin has the biggest port in the northern part of the country. Besides being a major transport and shipping hub, the city is also a manufacturing center, producing cars, textiles, metalwork and chemicals. Tianjin is China's fourth most densely populated city, with growth expected to continue over the next decade.\n\n17. Jakarta, Indonesia\n\n• Population density: 27,138 per square mile\n\n• Population: 14,250,000\n\n• Square miles: 525 miles\n\nEmployment opportunities and a high standard of living are among the factors causing people from across Indonesia to migrate to the capital city of Jakarta. About half of the population is thought to have actually been born in the city. The growth, which is predicted to continue, has brought problems, including the worst air pollution in Southeast Asia. Auto emissions and coal-fired power plants are among the main sources of the hazardous air quality.\n\n16. Tehran, Iran\n\n• Population density: 27,372 per square mile\n\n• Population: 7,250,000\n\n• Square miles: 265 miles\n\nMigrants are behind the population growth in Tehran. Most of the newcomers to the capital of Iran come from other cities within the country. However, reverse migration could be on the upswing, with residents becoming concerned about environmental problems and fewer economic opportunities. Though Tehran is an old and interesting city, Iran ranks high on the list of countries the U.S. government doesn't want you to visit, citing a high risk of kidnapping, arrest and detention.\n\n15. Manila, Philippines\n\n• Population density: 27,307 per square mile\n\n• Population: 14,750,000\n\n• Square miles: 540 miles\n\nBased on employment growth and gross domestic production per capita growth between 2014 and 2016, Manila has a solid place on the list of top-performing metro areas, according to a study published in 2018. The densely populated city had employment growth of 5.7%, and GDP per capita of 5.5%, landing it among the 10 top performers on Earth. While the solid financial outlook may contribute to growth, Manila could become a destination for dedicated shoppers: The Philippine capital is the site of the biggest Ikea store in the world, which is set to open in 2020.\n\n14. Kinshasa, DRC\n\n• Population density: 27,612 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 181 miles\n\nMigration from rural areas, high fertility rates, and widening of the city's boundaries have contributed to the burgeoning population in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With a life expectancy of just over 50 years, millions of people facing food insecurity, and 85% of the population believing their government is corrupt, the DRC is considered one of the world's most miserable places to life.\n\n13. New Delhi, India\n\n• Population density: 28,600 per square mile\n\n• Population: 14,300,000\n\n• Square miles: 500 miles\n\nThere's always a trade-off: New Delhi is one of the least expensive cities in the world, but it also has some of the worst air quality. Improved infrastructure, education and standard of living have attracted people from all over the country to India's capital. Technology, banking, transportation and government are the biggest employers in this densely populated metro area.\n\n12. Beijing, China\n\n• Population density: 29,827 per square mile\n\n• Population: 8,614,000\n\n• Square miles: 289 miles\n\nPopulation growth in the Beijing megalopolis comes from a variety of sources, including migrants moving to the nation's capital in search of opportunity, and the easing of restrictions limiting families to only one child. One of the oldest capital cities in the world, Beijing's urban problems include air pollution, dealing with domestic waste, and traffic congestion.\n\n11. Lima, Peru\n\n• Population density: 30,419 per square mile\n\n• Population: 7,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 230 miles\n\nThe densely populated Lima is the financial and industrial hub and capital city of Peru. Fishing and mining (gold, copper, zinc and lead) are among the region's main businesses. Manufacturing and tourism are other revenue generators. Lima will be in the spotlight this summer as it hosts the 2019 Pan American Games.\n\nLooking for a home? The housing market is about to shift in a bad way for buyers\n\n10. Shanghai, China\n\n• Population density: 34,718 per square mile\n\n• Population: 10,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 288 miles\n\nFor more than two decades, Shanghai has been among the fastest growing urban areas in the world. Migration is behind much of the population expansion, with people from other regions of China flocking to the area. Shanghai is the world's busiest container port; major industries include financial services, tech, wholesale and retail, real estate, transportation, construction, and manufacturing.\n\n9. Bogota, Colombia\n\n• Population density: 35,000 per square mile\n\n• Population: 7,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 200 miles\n\nLocated at more than 8,000 feet above sea level, Bogota is among the highest capital cities on Earth. The country's center of government and industry, Bogota is aiming to become one of the greenest cities on the continent. A member of the World Green Building Council for the past decade, Bogota has tightened its building codes, made a priority of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving sustainability.\n\n8. Chennai, India\n\n• Population density: 37,223 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,950,000\n\n• Square miles: 160 miles\n\nThe capital of Tamil Nadu state, Chennai is a governmental, industrial and cultural center in southern India. Much of the growth in the megalopolis is from migrants moving from rural areas in the state in search of jobs, though Chennai is also a destination for people from throughout the nation. In recent weeks the region has faced a water shortage, as four of the largest reservoirs are virtually dry from lack of rain.\n\n7. Taipei, Taiwan\n\n• Population density: 39,263 per square mile\n\n• Population: 5,700,000\n\n• Square miles: 145 miles\n\nThough there's no doubt that Taipei is among the most densely populated places on Earth, there's some concern that the headcount may actually begin to drop. A low birth rate and aging population are fueling fears of a future dwindling workforce and decline in productivity that could slow technical innovation and take a toll on the economy.\n\nTaiwan is the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage, and in June, Taipei was the scene of Asia's largest gay pride parade.\n\n6. Seoul/Incheon, South Korea\n\n• Population density: 43,208 per square mile\n\n• Population: 17,500,000\n\n• Square miles: 405 miles\n\nLow birth rates have caused Seoul's population growth to level off somewhat. But there's not likely to be much room to roam in South Korea's capital for the foreseeable future. The city's population density is about twice that of New York City and four times higher than that of Los Angeles. The region has the distinction of having one of the best-run airports in the world, Incheon International.\n\n5. Shenzhen, China\n\n• Population density: 44,464 per square mile\n\n• Population: 8,000,000\n\n• Square miles: 180 miles\n\nThere are a lot of \"mosts\" associated with Shenzhen. Though not a capital city, it is the most densely populated region in China. It is also the location of four of the world's tallest buildings. As of 2017, Shenzhen ranked 6th among cities with the most electric cars on the road. And as of 2017, Shenzhen-based Huawei was 49th on the list of the most valuable brands in the world.\n\n4. Lagos, Nigeria\n\n• Population density: 47,027 per square mile\n\n• Population: 13,400,000\n\n• Square miles: 285 miles\n\nThe one-time capital of Nigeria, Lagos is the most densely populated region in Africa. Among the reasons for the overcrowding is the influx of job seekers from rural areas, and refugees from countries like Togo and Cameroon fleeing to the mega-city. The cost of living in Lagos is among the lowest in the world, but the country as a whole has some of the poorest health statistics, including a life expectancy of just over 53 years of age and an infant mortality rate of almost 67 per 1,000 live births.\n\n3. Karachi, Pakistan\n\n• Population density: 49,000 per square mile\n\n• Population: 9,800,000\n\n• Square miles: 200 miles\n\nThe former capital of Pakistan, Karachi is the most crowded city in the Muslim world. Migrants and refugees from Bangladesh, Burma, Uganda, Iran and Afghanistan have moved into the area. Migrant workers from other regions of Pakistan add to the density. Though Karachi ranks among the least expensive cities for expatriates, it's also rated one of the least livable, with a drop in standard of living likely, according to a 2018 study.\n\n2. Kolkata, India\n\n• Population density: 61,945 per square mile\n\n• Population: 12,700,000\n\n• Square miles: 205 miles\n\nThere's a lot going on in the planet's second most crowded megalopolis. In addition to being a financial and manufacturing center, Kolkata has a major port and thriving tech sector. Nevertheless, problems with severe air pollution, poverty and infrastructure need to be addressed in the capital city of West Bengal state.\n\nCathedral controversy:Catholic school fires teacher for same-sex marriage, reaches settlement\n\n1. Mumbai, India\n\n• Population density: 76,790 per square mile\n\n• Population: 14,350,000\n\n• Square miles: 187 miles\n\nTens of thousands of people find themselves packed into each square mile of the most crowded urban area on Earth. Regardless of the overall dearth of space, the good life is alive and well in Mumbai, which has one of the greatest populations of mega-millionaires. From traffic congestion to huge landfills to breathtaking architecture, Bollywood movies and urban parkland, Mumbai is a city of contrasts and surprises.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

San Jose. Sacramento. San Diego. Los Angeles.\n\nOf the country's 20 most intensely gentrified cities, California has five of them, according to a new study.\n\nThe National Community Reinvestment Coalition used data from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau to rank the cities on gentrification during a five-year period ending in 2017.\n\nSan Francisco-Oakland was No. 1, followed by Denver, Boston, Miami-Fort Lauderdale and New Orleans. A similar study released last year ranked cities from 2000 to 2013, with Washington, D.C. as the most gentrified city. The nation's capital dropped to No. 13 in the newest study, released last month.\n\n\"NCRC once again found that gentrification and displacement was highly concentrated, and that most low-income neighborhoods, and the vast majority of cities, continued to deal with a chronic lack of investment,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\nResearchers identified 954 gentrifying neighborhoods for the study, mostly in 20 metropolitan cities.\n\nThe other California cities on the list: San Jose (8), Sacramento (10), San Diego (14) and Los Angeles (15).\n\n\"The coastal cities always show up as most gentrifying, so it's not surprising at all,\" said Karen Chapple, faculty director of the Urban Displacement Project at University of California, Berkeley.\n\nCoastal cities have \"the hottest housing markets\" and \"most intensive job growth,\" Chapple told USA TODAY.\n\nThe study shows that cities experiencing rapid population and economic growth were rare. Chronic disinvestment and poverty, rather than growth and displacement, were more common in nearly all low- or moderate-income neighborhoods, according to the study.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic has ravaged the U.S., it highlighted health, racial and economic disparities as Black and Latino communities have been disproportionately affected.\n\n“COVID-19 struck a nation that was already mostly struggling,” Jesse Van Tol, CEO of NCRC, said in a news release. “Recovery in most places will be even more challenging than in those where investment was already concentrated. There is no doubt that the protests that have erupted nationwide are at least in part motivated by the nation’s long history of racial economic inequality.”\n\nThe gentrification in the 2010s was related to job growth and transit, Chapple said. But as the pandemic continues, the demand to live in central cities may decline.\n\n\"I would expect that a lot of the real estate markets are going to soften considerably as people, particularly in tech jobs, begin working at home,\" she said.\n\nOne way to attack gentrification, Chapple said, is to preserve affordable housing before buildings are bought and flipped into high-end apartments — the Small Sites Program in San Francisco, for example, provides loans to nonprofit organizations to buy and convert buildings.\n\nThe full list:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/03/13/kentucky-counties-dominate-worst-places-to-live-list/3151985002/", "title": "Kentucky's coal country dominates list of worst places to live", "text": "Samuel Stebbins and Michael B. Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nKentucky counties don't fare well on a recent list ranking the worst U.S. places to live.\n\n24/7 Wall Street recently ranked the top 25 worst counties to live in, based on three factors: poverty, the percentage of adults who have at least a bachelor’s degree, and average life expectancy at birth.\n\nOf the top 25 counties, 10 of them are in Kentucky. (And even worse: six of the top 10 are Kentucky counties.)\n\nRead this:Plastics may be the new coal in Appalachia. But at what cost?\n\nHere's the report from 24/7 Wall St:\n\nJoblessness in the United States recently hit its lowest point since the 1960s; the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high last year; and America is now home to at least twice as many billionaires as any other country.\n\nIn this context, it can be easy to overlook the parts of the country that have been left behind. In dozens of communities across the United States there is widespread poverty and failing local businesses. In these areas, the population is shrinking and the average life expectancy at birth more closely resembles that of countries like Indonesia and Egypt.\n\n24/7 Wall St. constructed an index of three measures — poverty, the percentage of adults who have at least a bachelor’s degree, and average life expectancy at birth — to identify the worst counties to live in. Many of these counties also rank among the poorest and least healthy counties nationwide.\n\nNearly every county on this list falls into one of three categories: counties in Appalachian coal country, Southern counties along or near the Mississippi River, and those that lie within Native American reservations. Though these types of counties have very different histories and geographies, they each paint a similarly bleak picture of the underbelly of the largest economy in the world.\n\n44 deaths and rising:Kentucky's hepatitis A outbreak claims another victim\n\nTo determine the 25 worst counties to live, 24/7 Wall St. constructed an index consisting of three measures: bachelor’s degree attainment rate, poverty rate, and average life expectancy at birth.\n\nData on life expectancy is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation – an independent population health research center at the University of Washington. All other data is from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey and are 5-Year estimates.\n\n25. Floyd County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change : -5.1 percent\n\n: -5.1 percent Poverty rate: 30.7 percent\n\n30.7 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 12.6 percent\n\n: 12.6 percent Life expectancy: 72 years\n\nFloyd, a county in Eastern Kentucky, is the geographic center of the Appalachian region. The county epitomizes many of the social and economic problems so common throughout the region. More than 30 percent of county residents live below the poverty line, and a similar share rely on SNAP benefits, or food stamps, to afford basic necessities. Like many counties on this list, Floyd is losing residents rapidly. In the last five years, the county population fell by 5.1 percent, even as the U.S. population grew by 3.8 percent.\n\nFloyd County is one of 10 counties in Kentucky to rank among the 25 worst counties to live in in the United States.\n\n24. Apache County, Arizona\n\n5-year population change: 0 percent\n\n0 percent Poverty rate: 35.9 percent\n\n35.9 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 11.5 percent\n\n: 11.5 percent Life expectancy: 74.3 years\n\nApache County, Arizona, is located in the northeastern corner of the state, sharing a border with Utah and New Mexico. The Navajo Nation Reservation comprises much of Apache County and Native American reservations often struggle with social and economic challenges.\n\nIn the county, more than one in every three residents live below the poverty line. Financial hardship is partially attributable to a lack of job opportunities. As of the end of 2018, 11.1 percent of the county's labor force was out of work, compared to the 3.9 percent national unemployment rate.\n\n23. Jackson County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change : -0.8 percent\n\n: -0.8 percent Poverty rate : 33 percent\n\n: 33 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 10.5 percent\n\n: 10.5 percent Life expectancy: 73.3 years\n\nJackson County is located in central Kentucky and includes portions of the Daniel Boone national forest. Higher education can open doors to higher paying jobs, and areas with fewer college-educated adults often have lower income levels. In Jackson County, Kentucky, just 10.5 percent of adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 30.9 percent of adults nationwide. Further, at least half of all households in the area earn $33,000 or less per year, while most American households earn more than $57,000 a year.\n\n22. Yazoo County, Mississippi\n\n5-year population change : -2.6 percent\n\n: -2.6 percent Poverty rate : 36.5 percent\n\n: 36.5 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 14.3 percent\n\n: 14.3 percent Life expectancy: 73.5 years\n\nYazoo County is a located in the Delta region of central Mississippi. One of the poorest counties in the United States, 36.5 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, more than double the 14.6 percent national poverty rate.\n\nDriven by suicide and drug overdoses, life expectancy has fallen in the United States in each of the last three years. The last time life expectancy fell over a three year period was a century ago during the influenza pandemic. In Yazoo County, life expectancy fell from 73.7 years to 73.5 years between 2010 and 2014.\n\n21. McKinley County, New Mexico\n\n5-year population change : 1.3 percent\n\n: 1.3 percent Poverty rate: 37.5 percent\n\n37.5 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 10.8 percent\n\n: 10.8 percent Life expectancy: 74.9 years\n\nMcKinley County is located in western New Mexico along the Arizona border, adjacent to Apache County – another county on this list. Like Apache County, McKinley County is home to a large Native American Reservation. Due to a number of historical and political factors, populations living on reservations are more likely to perform relatively poorly in measures of social and economic well-being. In McKinley County, 37.5 percent of the population lives in poverty, one of the highest poverty rates of any U.S. county. Additionally, at 74.9 years, life expectancy in McKinley County is about four years below U.S. life expectancy.\n\n20. Martin County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -5.9 percent\n\n-5.9 percent Poverty rate: 29.8 percent\n\n29.8 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 8.2 percent\n\n: 8.2 percent Life expectancy: 72.6 years\n\nMartin County, located in Eastern Kentucky, is one of several counties on this list to be severely impacted by the decline of the U.S. coal industry. The number of coal jobs in the country fell by 63 percent between 2011 and 2015. Due in part to fewer employment opportunities, the number of people living in the county fell by nearly 6 percent in the last five years.\n\nCurrently, Martin County's population is one of the poorest in the United States. Nearly 30 percent of county residents live in poverty, and most households earn less than $30,000 a year.\n\n19. Wilcox County, Alabama\n\n5-year population change : -6.7 percent\n\n: -6.7 percent Poverty rate: 31.9 percent\n\n31.9 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 12 percent\n\n12 percent Life expectancy: 72.2 years\n\nWilcox is a county in southern Alabama, west of Montgomery. Nearly 32 percent of county residents live below the poverty line, more than double the 14.9 percent national poverty rate. Joblessness is one hurdle to prosperity. Unemployment in the county stands at 8.5 percent, more than double the comparable 3.9 percent national unemployment rate. Likely due in part to a lack of available work, people are leaving Wilcox County. In the last five years, the county population fell by 6.7 percent, even as the U.S. population grew by 3.8 percent.\n\n18. Sunflower County, Mississippi\n\n5-year population change: -7.9 percent\n\n-7.9 percent Poverty rate: 32.5 percent\n\n32.5 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 14.5 percent\n\n14.5 percent Life expectancy: 71.6 years\n\nSunflower is one of several counties in Mississippi's Delta region to rank among the worst places to live. As of the end of 2018, 8.5 percent of the county's labor force was out of work, more than double the 3.9 percent national unemployment rate. Over a third of area residents who are employed travel to work outside the county limits.\n\nThe high jobless rate is contributing to increased financial hardship in Sunflower County. Nearly a third of the county population lives in poverty, more than double the 14.6 percent national poverty rate.\n\n17. Mingo County, West Virginia\n\n5-year population change : -5.7 percent\n\n: -5.7 percent Poverty rate: 28.9 percent\n\n28.9 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 9.2 percent\n\n: 9.2 percent Life expectancy: 71.4 years\n\nMingo County, West Virginia, is one of several counties on this list located in Appalachian coal country. Like in much of the region, jobs are scarce in Mingo County. The unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent, and of those who are working, nearly 40 percent commute to jobs outside the county limits.\n\nThe weak economy may be driving people out of Mingo County. A continuation of a long-term trend, the number of people living in the county dropped by 5.7 percent in the last five years. Currently, about 25,000 people live in Mingo County, down from a peak of 47,400 in 1950.\n\n16.

In Knox County in southeastern Kentucky, only 68 percent of adults have a high school diploma, and just 10 percent have a bachelor's degree – compared to 87 percent and 30 percent of adults nationwide, respectively. Low incomes are typical in places with such low educational attainment rates. In Knox County, more than one in every five households earn less than $10,000 a year as compared to 6.7 percent of the U.S. overall, and more than one in every three residents live below the poverty line.\n\n15. Leflore County, Mississippi\n\n5-year population change: -6.5 percent\n\n-6.5 percent Poverty rate : 40.3 percent\n\n: 40.3 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 17.9 percent\n\n17.9 percent Life expectancy: 72.7 years\n\nLeflore County, Mississippi, is one of the poorest counties in the United States. About one in every four area households earn less than $10,000 a year, and over 40 percent of the population lives in poverty. The widespread financial hardship is partially attributable to the area's weak job market. As of the end of last year, 7.3 percent of Leflore County's labor force was unemployed.\n\nAs is the case in many counties with high poverty and unemployment rates, people are leaving Leflore. In the last five years, the number of county residents declined by 6.5 percent.\n\n14. Coahoma County, Mississippi\n\n5-year population change: -6.9 percent\n\nPoverty rate: 36.2 percent\n\nBachelor's degree attainment: 16.9 percent\n\nLife expectancy: 71.1 years\n\nCoahoma County is located in Mississippi's Delta region. The broader region has faced serious economic challenges for decades, as increasing mechanization in agriculture has reduced the need for labor, and a once promising manufacturing sector has been hollowed out. With an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, Coahoma County has not been spared.\n\nIn Coahoma County, high unemployment goes hand in hand with low incomes. More than one in every three county residents live below the poverty line, more than double the 14.6 percent national poverty rate.\n\n13. Phillips County, Arkansas\n\n5-year population change: -9.8 percent\n\nPoverty rate: 33.0 percent\n\nBachelor's degree attainment: 11.3 percent\n\nLife expectancy: 71.3 years\n\nPhillips County, located along the banks of the Mississippi in the Arkansas Delta region, is the second-oldest county in the state. It is also the worst county to live in in the state. Life expectancy is an indicator of local conditions, and in Phillips County, the average life expectancy is just 71.3 years, about eight years below the national life expectancy.\n\nMany of the worst counties to live in are losing residents rapidly, but few are shrinking as fast as Phillips County. In the last five years, the number of people living in Phillips County fell by 9.8 percent, even as the U.S. population grew by 3.8 percent. Currently, the county is home to fewer than 20,000 people, down from a peak of over 46,000 in 1950.\n\n12. Union County, Florida\n\n5-year population change: -0.6 percent\n\n-0.6 percent Poverty rate: 21.4 percent\n\n21.4 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 8.3 percent\n\n: 8.3 percent Life expectancy: 67.6 years\n\nUnion County is located in northern Florida and is the only county in the state to rank on this list. The average life expectancy fell by over half a year between 2010 and 2014 in Union County and is now just 67.6 years, more than 11 years below life expectancy nationwide.\n\nUnlike most counties on this list, Union County has relatively low unemployment rate. Just 2.9 percent of the county's labor force was unemployed at the end of 2018, below the 3.8 percent national unemployment rate. Many of the jobs in the county, however, are stressful and dangerous. The local economy relies heavily on the Union Correctional Institution, a maximum security prison.\n\n11. Madison Parish, Louisiana\n\n5-year population change: -4.1 percent\n\n-4.1 percent Poverty rate : 36.4 percent\n\n: 36.4 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 13.4 percent\n\n13.4 percent Life expectancy: 71.6 years\n\nThe only county equivalent in Louisiana to rank on this list, Madison Parish is located in the eastern part of the state along the Mississippi River. Like many of the counties and parishes along the Mississippi River, Madison Parish is poor, and people are leaving it. More than one in every three parish residents live in poverty, and the population shrunk by 4.1 percent in the last five years.\n\nA stronger job market in Madison Parish would likely go a long way in alleviating economic conditions and slow population decline. As of the end of last year, 7.4 percent of the area's labor force was unemployed, compared to the 3.8 percent national unemployment rate.\n\n10. Harlan County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -5.7 percent\n\n-5.7 percent Poverty rate : 35.6 percent\n\n: 35.6 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 11.4 percent\n\n11.4 percent Life expectancy: 71.5 years\n\nHarlan is one of many coal mining counties in Kentucky to rank on this list. As the coal industry declined in the second half of the 20th century, so has Harlan County's population. Currently, 27,500 people live in Harlan, down from a peak of 75,300 in 1940. In the last five years alone, the number of people living in the county declined by 5.7 percent.\n\nLife expectancy in the United States has declined in recent years, largely due to opioid overdose deaths. Kentucky is one of the states hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, and in Harlan County, life expectancy declined slightly between 2010 and 2014. Life expectancy in the county is just 71.5 years, nearly eight years below the average life expectancy nationwide.\n\n9. Bell County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -4.0 percent\n\n-4.0 percent Poverty rate: 38.0 percent\n\n38.0 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 9.3 percent\n\n9.3 percent Life expectancy: 72.7 years\n\nBell County is located in the southeastern corner of Kentucky, along the Virginia and Tennessee state borders. Life expectancy in the county is less than 73 years, about six years below the national life expectancy. Poorer Americans have less access to health care and can afford fewer healthy options related to diet and lifestyle and therefore often report worse health outcomes – and many Bell County residents struggle financially. The county's poverty rate of 38 percent is well more than double the 14.6 percent national poverty rate.\n\n8. Leslie County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -5.9 percent\n\n-5.9 percent Poverty rate: 34.5 percent\n\n34.5 percent Bachelor's degree attainmen t: 8.9 percent\n\nt: 8.9 percent Life expectancy: 71.2 years\n\nLeslie County is located in Kentucky's Eastern Coal Field region. Like much of the region, the county's population has declined along with the U.S. coal industry. Currently, 10,600 people live in Leslie County, down from a peak of 15,500 in 1950. In the last five years alone, the county's population fell by 5.9 percent. Much of that population decline is likely attributable to the lack of jobs. The county has a higher than average unemployment rate, and the majority of the labor force commutes to work outside of county limits.\n\n7. Breathitt County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -4.6 percent\n\n-4.6 percent Poverty rate : 36.0 percent\n\n: 36.0 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 12.6 percent\n\n: 12.6 percent Life expectancy: 70.2 years\n\nBreathitt County sits in the foothills of the Appalachian mountains in the Eastern Coal Field region of Kentucky. Coal country has been hollowed out as the American coal industry has steadily declined for decades – and Breathitt has not been spared. In the last five years alone, the number of people living in the county fell by 4.6 percent.\n\nLife expectancy in the county is just over 70 years, about nine years less than the national average life expectancy. Breathitt is also one of the poorest counties in the United States. Most households earn less than $26,000 a year, and over a third of the population lives below the poverty line.\n\n6. Clay County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -4.4 percent\n\nPoverty rate: 39.5 percent\n\nBachelor's degree attainment: 9.5 percent\n\nLife expectancy: 71.8 years\n\nClay County is another southeastern Kentucky, coal-producing county to rank on this list. In addition to coal mining, tobacco, timber, and corn are critical components of the local economy – industries that typically do not require much in the way of a formal education. Less than one in every 10 adults in Clay County have a bachelor's degree or higher, less than a third of the 30.6 percent national bachelor's degree attainment rate.\n\nLike other counties on this list, life expectancy in Clay County is low and falling. Life expectancy is just 71.8 years in the county, well below the 79.1 year national average, and down 0.3 years from 2010.\n\n5. McCreary County, Kentucky\n\n5-year population change: -2.5 percent\n\n-2.5 percent Poverty rate: 41.0 percent\n\n41.0 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 7.6 percent\n\n: 7.6 percent Life expectancy: 72.9 years\n\nLike other nearby counties in southeastern Kentucky, McCreary County has been decimated by the decline of the coal industry. Throughout the 20th century, over two dozen coal mines that once employed thousands of local workers shut down. While mining operations have begun to sprout up again in recent years, McCreary is still struggling economically. The county has a higher than average unemployment rate, and 45 percent of area residents with jobs commute to work outside the county limits. One of the poorest counties in the United States, McCreary has a 41 percent poverty rate, and half of all area households earn less than $20,000 a year.\n\n4. McDowell County, West Virginia\n\n5-year population change : -10.3 percent\n\n: -10.3 percent Poverty rate: 34.9 percent\n\n34.9 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 4.9 percent\n\n: 4.9 percent Life expectancy: 70.3 years\n\nMcDowell County is the worst county to live in in West Virginia and the fourth worst nationwide. A coal county located in the southern part of the state, McDowell is characterized by population decline and poverty. Currently, the county is home to less than 20,000 people, down from nearly 100,000 in 1950. In the last five years alone, the county's population shrunk by 10.3 percent. Of the remaining residents, more than a third live below the poverty line.\n\nOpioid overdoses are lowering life expectancy in the United States, and McDowell County has been hit especially hard by the opioid epidemic. Between 2010 and 2014, life expectancy in the county fell slightly from 70.4 years to 70.3.\n\n3. Holmes County, Mississippi\n\n5-year population change: -4.9 percent\n\n-4.9 percent Poverty rate: 46.5 percent\n\n46.5 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 10.7 percent\n\n10.7 percent Life expectancy: 71 years\n\nHolmes County is one of several counties in the Mississippi Delta to rank on this list. The county's 46.5 percent poverty rate is nearly the highest of any U.S. county and more than triple the 14.6 percent national poverty rate. Additionally, 29.2 percent of household in the country earn less than $10,000 a year, the largest share of any U.S. county.\n\nThe widespread financial hardship is partially attributable to a weak job market. As of the end of last year, 8.7 percent of county workers were unemployed, and among those who had a job, 44 percent commuted to work outside the county limits.\n\n2. Todd County, South Dakota\n\n5-year population change: 3.1 percent\n\n3.1 percent Poverty rate: 52.0 percent\n\n52.0 percent Bachelor's degree attainment: 16.2 percent\n\n16.2 percent Life expectancy: 68.5 years\n\nTodd County is located along South Dakota's southern border and includes much of the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Native American Reservations often have deeply entrenched economic problems, and Todd County's 52 percent poverty rate is the highest of any county in the United States.\n\nTodd County also has one of the least healthy populations in the country. Life expectancy at birth in the county is just 68.5 years – about 10 years less than the national average life expectancy.\n\n1. Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota\n\n5-year population change: N/A\n\nN/A Poverty rate: 51.9 percent\n\n51.9 percent Bachelor's degree attainment : 12.4 percent\n\n: 12.4 percent Life expectancy: 66.8 years\n\nOglala Lakota County, which falls entirely within the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southern South Dakota, is the worst county to live in in both the state and the country. Average life expectancy can be indicative of local conditions, and in Oglala Lakota County, life expectancy is just 66.8 years, the lowest of any U.S. county and more in line with life expectancy in developing nations like Pakistan and Tanzania than the United States.\n\nSerious financial hardship is common in Oglala Lakota County. It is one of only two counties in the country where over half of the population lives in poverty, and nearly 55 percent of county residents rely on SNAP, or food stamps, to afford basic necessities.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Hawaii topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country while Mississippi led the country with both the weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n“What this project does, is show what we’ve been saying for years: Gun laws save lives,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. “We think this is going to be a really important tool for lawmakers, reporters and advocates that have been looking for the kind of visual tool that can make that case clearly.”\n\nThe findings of the study have come into sharp focus following a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials told CNN that the gunman legally purchased two assault rifles for his 18th birthday.\n\nTexas has steadily loosened restrictions on gun ownership over the past several years. Last September, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. Texas is ranked 34 out of 50 states in Everytown’s gun law strength ranking.\n\nTo compile its list, the group used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at each state’s rate of gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates with 50 policies that they say are scientifically proven to be effective in preventing gun violence, Suplina said.\n\nThe research team then weighed the list of gun safety policies based on their efficacy, ranked each state on its implementation of those policies and compared that score with the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said.\n\nThe CDC’s data includes homicides, accidental killings and suicides committed by guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000 people in the United States were killed with a firearm in 2020 – more than half died by suicide.\n\nThe analysis, first reported by CNN, put California at the top of the list for gun law strength – a composite score of 84.5 out of 100, with a low rate of 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 residents, and below the national average of 13.6. Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country with the second strongest gun law score. It also has the lowest rate of gun ownership, with firearms in 9% of households, the data shows.\n\nFew gun control laws passed as 2022 sessions wrap\n\nAs state legislatures wrap up their 2022 legislative sessions, lawmakers will consider a breadth of bills that either loosen or expand gun protections across various states.\n\n“I have seen firsthand in California that the work we have done to strengthen gun laws has been both life-saving and effective,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Gun laws work, and we need them across the board to ensure that felons, domestic abusers, and those with mental health issues can’t simply go to the next state over to circumvent the very laws meant to keep guns out of their hands.”\n\nCNN reached out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) to comment on the research before it was first published in January, but it declined to do so before seeing the data.\n\nMississippi has the weakest gun laws with a score of 3 out of 100 and has a rate of 28.6 gun deaths per 100,000 residents – the highest of all states, the research shows.\n\nMassachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 policies and has the second-lowest rate of gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of the gun safety policies and the fourth highest rate of gun deaths in the US. Louisiana and Wyoming are among the top five states with the highest gun deaths and the weakest gun safety laws.\n\n“Lawmakers in the states at the bottom can’t pretend to be ignorant about the importance of gun laws after looking at this report,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six educators.\n\nMother and activist DeAndra Dycus said the gun violence problem in Indianapolis is “tearing our community apart.”\n\nNearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, DeAndre “Dre” Knox, was shot in the back left side of his head at a birthday party in Indianapolis when shots were fired during a confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, now 21, survived after being on life support for several days, Dycus said, and he currently lives in a facility with non-verbal quadriplegic paralysis.\n\n“As a mother, when I look at him, I see everything that was taken away,” Dycus said. “My son was a dreamer. He was a scholar. He was on this road to being something great.”\n\n“But on the flip side, I see this little boy who has made such an impact, not just on our city but our country, as it pertains to what it looks like to survive,” she said. “Dre has embodied that.”\n\nMembers of Moms Demand Action protest in Texas on Thursday, June 17, 2021, in Austin, Texas, after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill allowing Texans age 21 or older to carry handguns without a permit. Ana Ramirez/AP/FILE\n\nSecure storage laws deemed essential to gun safety\n\nEverytown designated a list of five foundational laws that have proven to be the most effective in lowering gun violence rates. These include requirements for a background check and/or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws; and the enactment of ‘extreme risk’ laws that temporarily remove a person’s access to firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others, according to Everytown.\n\nLast year, several conservative states – including Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming – passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to address gun violence following several high-profile mass shootings. But Congress has shown little to no movement on passing any meaningful federal gun reforms.\n\nA memorial outside of Oxford High School on December 3, 2021, in Michigan. Four students were killed on November 30, when student Ethan Crumbley allegedly opened fire. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn Texas, the controversial “constitutional carry” legislation went into effect in September that allows most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that by removing the licensing requirement they are removing an “artificial barrier” to residents’ right to bear arms under the Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to “the protection of themselves or their families” in public. But law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult for police to quell violence.\n\n“As we’ve seen gun extremism continue to rise in this country, we’ve also seen people who open carry start out at marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials’ homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th at the US Capitol,” Watts said.\n\nAccording to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school in December that killed four students is a “textbook example” of why laws that require the secure storage of firearms are essential to gun safety.\n\nThe alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and wounding several others on November 30. His parents were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan’s alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting could have been prevented.\n\nOnly 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure storage requirement, Watts said.\n\nLast year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others, according to Watts.\n\nDuring this year’s legislative session, Watts said the organization would work with lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California, Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure storage.\n\nEverytown’s research shows that 21 of the country’s states have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they can safely walk away from the situation.\n\nA Chicago police officer investigates a fatal shooting in the Hyde Park neighborhood in November 2021. John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nDespite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina says.\n\nAccording to Suplina, this could explain why such a high number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes, including murder.\n\nGun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of the country’s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nWhile experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI’s 2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019. The agency reported that the number of homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year jump the agency has recorded.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nChina’s abrupt and under-prepared exit from zero-Covid could lead to nearly 1 million deaths, according to a new study, as the country braces for an unprecedented wave of infections spreading out from its biggest cities to its vast rural areas.\n\nFor nearly three years, the Chinese government has used strict lockdowns, centralized quarantines, mass testing and rigorous contact tracing to curb the spread of the virus. That costly strategy was abandoned earlier this month, following an explosion of protests across the country against stringent restrictions that have upended businesses and daily life.\n\nBut experts have warned that the country is poorly prepared for such a drastic exit, having fallen short on bolstering the elderly vaccination rate, upping surge and intensive care capacity in hospitals, and stockpiling antiviral medications.\n\nUnder the current conditions, a nationwide reopening could result in up to 684 deaths per million people, according to the projections by three professors at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nGiven China’s population of 1.4 billion people, that would amount to 964,400 deaths.\n\nThe surge of infections would “likely overload many local health systems across the country,” said the research paper, released last week on the Medrxiv preprint server and which has yet to undergo peer review.\n\nSimultaneously lifting restrictions in all provinces would lead to hospitalization demands 1.5 to 2.5 times of surge hospital capacity, according to the study.\n\nBut this worst case scenario could be avoided if China rapidly rolls out booster shots and antiviral drugs.\n\nWith fourth-dose vaccination coverage of 85% and antiviral coverage of 60%, the death toll can be reduced by 26% to 35%, according to the study, which is funded partly by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Hong Kong government.\n\nA health worker waits for people to take swab samples to test for Covid-19 in Shanghai on December 19, 2022. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, Chinese health authorities announced two Covid deaths, both in the capital Beijing, which is grappling with its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThey were the first officially reported deaths since the dramatic easing of restrictions on December 7, although Chinese social media posts have pointed to a surge in demand at Beijing’s funeral homes and crematoriums in recent weeks.\n\nAn employee at a funeral home on the outskirts of Beijing told CNN they were swamped by the long queues for cremation, and customers would need to wait until at least the next day to cremate their loved ones.\n\nOn Baidu, China’s dominant online search engine, searches for “funeral homes” by Beijing residents have hit a record high since the pandemic began.\n\nOther major cities are also facing a surge in infections. In the financial hub of Shanghai, schools have moved most classes online starting from Monday. In the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, authorities have told students that are already taking online classes and pre-schoolers not to prepare for a return to school.\n\nIn the megacity of Chongqing in the southwest, authorities announced on Sunday that public sector workers testing positive for Covid can go to work “as normal” – a remarkable turnaround for a city that only weeks ago had been in the throes of a mass lockdown.\n\nIt is difficult to judge the true scale of the outbreak by official numbers. China stopped reporting asymptomatic cases last week, conceding it was no longer possible to track the actual number of infections. These asymptomatic cases used to account for the bulk of the country’s official caseload. But the rest of the case count has been rendered meaningless too, as cities roll back mass testing and allow people to use antigen tests and isolate at home.\n\nChinese experts have warned that the worst is yet to come. Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, said the country is being hit by the first of three expected waves of infections this winter.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Beijing on Saturday, Wu said the current wave would run until mid-January. The second wave is expected to last from late January to mid-February next year, triggered by the mass travel ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls on January 21.\n\nEvery year, hundreds of millions of people who have left their hometowns to build a life in China’s fast growing cities pour into trains, buses and planes to see their family – a weeks-long travel rush known as the largest annual human migration on Earth.\n\nFor three consecutive years, these homecoming trips have been discouraged by authorities under the zero-Covid policy. And experts warn that with domestic travel restrictions lifted, the virus could sweep through China’s countryside, where vaccination rates are lower and medical resources are lacking.\n\nA third wave of cases would run from late February to mid-March as people returned to work after the week-long holiday, Wu said.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Cheng Cheng", "Nectar Gan", "Cheng Cheng"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html", "title": "90% of US adults say mental health is a crisis in the United States ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn overwhelming majority of people in the United States think the country is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNine out of 10 adults said ​they believed that there’s a mental health crisis in the US today. Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

In 2022 the Show-Me state garnered 26 spots on the list — compared to just 17 in Iowa, 12 in New York and seven each in Kansas and Wisconsin.\n\n“The 2022 Horrible Hundred report is our 10th annual report on problem puppy breeders and dealers in the United States. The Humane Society of the United States has published the Horrible Hundred report annually since 2013 to warn consumers about common problems at puppy mills and puppy-selling dealers, and to push for new legislation and stronger enforcement of humane laws. Altogether, our 10 years of reports have covered more than 650 breeders and dealers in 33 different states over that same period,” reads the report.\n\nThat Missouri has so many puppy mills is no surprise, according to Humane Society Stop Puppy Mills campaign senior director John Goodwin.\n\n“Missouri has always been at the heart of the puppy mill industry since the beginning,” Goodwin told the News-Leader. “The post-World War II era was a time period where there was a lot of consolidation in agriculture and a lot of small farms closed. This industry was seen as a solution in midwestern states and Missouri became the epicenter of large-scale pully mills.”\n\nThat evolution was aided by regulations allowing puppy mills to flourish, Goodwin said. That would have changed in a 2010 proposition approved by voters that would have required large-scale breeders to provide “sufficient food, clean water, housing and space” to the dogs under their care as well as providing “necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles.”\n\nAfter the initiative was passed, the language of the regulations were changed by the state legislature. According to Goodwin, these measures watered down protections for animals and were pushed through the legislature by agricultural special interests.\n\n“It doesn't make sense to most people. Why agricultural interest with puppy mills? But they believe that if we protect dogs, they'll be required to give pigs and chickens enough room in turn around. They saw this as something that could cause other animals to be treated better, which affects the almighty dollar,” Goodwin said.\n\nDog breeders are also regulated in the state by the Missouri Department of Agriculture. According to their website, current law requires breeders to use elevated flooring with solid resting areas, animals with serious illness or injury must be treated promptly by a licensed veterinarian, they must provide continuous access to potable water that is not frozen, and meet spacing requirements based on the number of dogs.\n\nThe Humane Society advocates for the abolishment of puppy mills and replacing the industry with small-scale breeders.\n\n“A puppy mill is a commercial dog breeding kennel where the animals are viewed not as family pets but as units of production. So you walk into a puppy mill, you find row after row of dogs living in cages — being bred every heat cycle till their body wears out,” Goodwin said.\n\nWhile the Humane Society works toward the abolition of the practice, they advocate for stricter regulation of the industry.\n\n“Right now under the USDA regulations, you can keep a dog in a cage there's only six inches longer than her body. You can keep a dog in a cage standing on wire flooring her entire life. They can breed her every heat cycle until her body wears out, and then they can kill her,” Goodwin said. “And we call for spacious, comfortable enclosures with humane flooring with limits on how many times a dog is bred — with daily exercise and socialization requirements.”\n\nBreeders in SWMO\n\nOf the 26 dog breeders cited by the Human Society in Missouri, at least ten reside in southwest Missouri. Closest to Springfield is Wendy Laymon, who breeds dogs in nearby Rogersville. Since the 1990s Laymon has continuously received violations from both the USDA and state regulators in Missouri and Washington state.\n\n“(Laymon) was given two official warnings for repeated violations in 2021 and 2022; has a 20-plus-year history of recurring problems with poor veterinary care, inadequate housing, sick puppy sales and legal issues,” reads the report.\n\nHer breeding facility was shut down in Washington and Laymon was banned from owning animals in the state. She then moved to Missouri and reopened her kennel just outside of Springfield.\n\nIn 2009 action was levied against Laymon for multiple violations of the Animal Welfare Act. She was fined $7,125 and banned from holding a USDA license for three years. But Laymon continued to be licensed by the state of Missouri.\n\nReached for comment by the News-Leader, Laymon denied she treated dogs under her care poorly — claiming she runs “one of the nicest kennels in the whole world.”\n\nBefore disconnecting from the call, Laymon said the Humane Society had been harassing her for many years and said she would sue if the News-Leader reports her business’ long history of violations.\n\nAccording to Laymon’s website, she promises to “promote the highest ideals among dog owners and breeders.”\n\nHere is an incomplete snapshot of other SWMO breeders included in the Humane Society’s “Horrible Hundred” list.\n\nCory's Cuties in Elkland\n\nHaving previously been sued by the Missouri Attorney General and fined $4,500, Cory's Cuties' owner was again found in 2021 and 2022 with a thin dog, dogs and puppies who had no water, dogs and puppies forced to stand in their own feces, and many other significant issues impacting the basic health and well-being of her dogs.\n\nIn 2021 an inspector found puppies standing in their own waste at the Elkland kennel.\n\n“I observed an enclosure housing five weaned Pomeranian puppies that contained an excessive amount of feces in the indoor and outdoor portions of their enclosure. These puppies were unable to avoid contact with the feces in the enclosure,” reads the inspector’s report.\n\nThe owner of Cory’s Cuties did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the News-Leader.\n\nAccording to their website, dogs bred by the business are “well socialized & ready for their new families.”\n\n“I have been raising puppies for 20 years now and enjoy every one of them. They are each special in their own way and no 2 have ever been alike!” it reads.\n\nArrowhead Springs Kennel in Ava\n\nArrowhead Springs Kennel in Ava received USDA violations in November 2021 for a very thin mother dog named Fancy whose ribs were prominent and who had not been evaluated or treated by a veterinarian.\n\n“A red & white Australian Shepherd female with 7 puppies (approximately 1 week old), is very thin. There was an abdominal tuck and the spine and ribs were easily felt by the inspector.” The owner claimed they were feeding the dog, but “there was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis or treatment for this dog.”\n\nThere were more than 50 dogs and puppies present at the time of the inspection.\n\nIncredible Puppies in Rocky Comfort\n\nBetween May 2021 and February 2022, state inspectors had questions about at least seven different dogs at Incredible Puppies who died, with six noted to be under unexplained circumstances. In May 2021, state inspectors noted that “since the previous inspection at least five dogs have died or were euthanized” and the licensee was unable to provide full information on when the dogs died for at least four of the animals. The inspector also noted that there were “twelve unidentified weaned puppies being housed in outdoor and sheltered enclosures,” and there was another violation for poor recordkeeping on dogs, according to state records.\n\nThe News-Leader was unable to contact the owner of Incredible Puppies.\n\nHow to avoid puppy mills\n\nA full list of Missouri breeders on the “Horrible Hundred” list can be found on the Humane Society's website.\n\nTo avoid receiving a pet from a puppy mill, Goodwin cautioned to not purchase puppies online or in pet stores.\n\n“Don't buy a pet store puppy or puppy over the internet sight unseen. Those almost always come from puppy mills. And if you think about it, that's because high volume pet retailers need high volume breeders to keep those display cases filled with puppies at all times,” he said.\n\nIf possible, prospective pet owners should try to adopt a dog from a shelter. If purchasing a puppy in-person or online, request to see the breeder, the puppy’s mother and where the mother lives.\n\n“That will provide a level of transparency to help weed out any puppy mills.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/africa/bayelsa-flood-victims-nigeria-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Displaced by devastating floods, Nigerians are forced to use ...", "text": "Bayelsa, Nigeria CNN —\n\nNigeria’s southern Bayelsa state is officially nicknamed the ‘glory of all lands.’ But much of it is now a river that has driven entire communities away from their homes.\n\nDesperate to survive, many locals fleeing raging floods which have wrecked their homes and livelihoods are also forced to depend on floodwater for sustenance.\n\nFor displaced inhabitants of northern Bayelsa’s Odi town, who have found new homes in roadside shacks and tent shelters with no access to running water, stagnant floodwaters are the only available alternatives for drinking, cooking and bathing.\n\nAs she rinses her uncooked fish in dirty floodwater next to her neighbor doing his laundry, local trader Chigozie Uzo shares her fears of catching a waterborne disease.\n\n“I’ve heard of cholera,” she told CNN, “but I don’t have a choice than to use this water.”\n\nChigozie Uzo (L), a displaced resident of Odi, in Nigeria's southern Bayelsa State rinses her uncooked fish in dirty floodwater, Tuesday. Nimi Princewill/CNN\n\nMeters away from Uzo, a young girl aged no more than five years old squats to urinate in the same floodwater she had rinsed her pot and plates in.\n\nHumanitarian agencies fear the floods will contribute to a health disaster and Nigeria has already seen a rise in cholera infections as floods ravage many parts of the country.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, “more than 2.5 million people in Nigeria are in need of humanitarian assistance – 60 per cent of which are children – and are at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition due to the most severe flooding in the past decade.”\n\nA rise in cholera infections could be devastating for the country as the World Health Organization warns of a “strained global supply of cholera vaccines.”\n\nBayelsa and 30 other Nigerian states have reported thousands of suspected cholera cases, the country’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) said in a recent report.\n\nA child is pictured doing her dishes in floodwater in Odi, in Nigeria's southern Bayelsa State, on Tuesday. Nimi Princewill/CNN\n\nBayelsa is among 33 of 36 Nigerian states grappling with the devastation of the country’s worst flooding in a decade. More than 600 lives have been lost in floods across the West African country, its government says, and almost 1.5 million people have been displaced, according to the country’s humanitarian ministry.\n\nAniso Handy, 56, has remained in his house in Odi, which has been overrun by water.\n\n“I still live here,” he told CNN as he paddled his canoe into his flooded living room before making his way to a dry room upstairs.\n\n“My family doesn’t stay here because of the flood and for their safety … but I know how to swim,” he said.\n\nAniso Handy has remained in his house in Odi, in Nigeria's Bayelsa State. Nimi Princewill/CNN\n\nFor some in the community, such as 27-year-old Igbomiye Zibokere, this is not the first time they have experienced the devastating effects of flooding.\n\nDuring the last major flooding in 2012, her sick mother drowned in her room when water engulfed their home, she told CNN.\n\n“My mum was ill when the floods came in 2012. The water level was high and my sister and I couldn’t carry her. All we could do was cry as she drowned in her room,” Zibokere said.\n\nZibokere, who is a petty trader, said she returned from the bush near her home in early October to find it taken over by water. The water level rose to her neck and they were forced to leave the house.\n\nIgbomiye Zibokere and her children have lost their home to the floods. Nimi Princewill/CNN\n\nShe and her young children are now homeless and living rough in a makeshift tent by the roadside.\n\n“We are in a canopy. If it rains, the canopy would be blown away by the wind and we’ll be beaten by the rain. I’m suffering now. No food to eat or water to drink,” the mother-of-five said.\n\nDisplacing the living and the dead\n\nIn Bayelsa’s capital Yenagoa, located 28 kilometers (17 miles) from Odi, floods have displaced not just the living but also the dead.\n\nIn Yenagoa’s Azikoro village, residents said bodies have been seen floating in floodwaters around a local cemetery.\n\nAdjusting to life wading through the stench of the stagnant water isn’t the only worry for residents of Azikoro as the cost-of-living skyrockets in Bayelsa due to the floods.\n\nWith major highways underwater, Bayelsa has been cut off from the rest of the country. Boats have become the only way to get around much of its environment.\n\nTo get to Bayelsa, travelers pay around 2,000 Naira (less than $5) to get on a packed tipper truck to cross flooded roads.\n\nThose unable to afford the fee can be seen wading through the water carrying what little possessions they can.\n\nFlooding in Nigeria's Bayelsa state has forced people to wade through waiste-high water. Nimi Princewill/CNN\n\nNigeria’s current flooding has been attributed to above-average rainfall and an overflowing dam in neighboring Cameroon. But the situation has also been exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure, environmentalists have said.\n\nWith a warmer climate causing more intense rainfall, authorities also blame climate change for the floods. In the meantime, the country aims to tackle one of the major causes of its flood problems by holding bilateral talks with Cameroon on the periodic opening of its dam, Nigeria’s humanitarian ministry said.\n\n“We must initiate a bilateral discussion with authorities in Cameroon next month (November 2022) on the periodic opening of the Lagdo dam,” a statement by the ministry said last week.\n\nComplaints leveled at authorities\n\nBut weeks since the flooding began, Nigeria’s government has yet to declare the flood a national emergency.\n\nMinister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, told local media last week: “It’s certainly an emergency situation but it all depends on what you mean by the declaring state of emergency. We have not reached a situation in my view where the relevant emergency management authorities have not been able to deal with this situation.”\n\nHandy isn’t pleased with the government’s response.\n\n“Nigerians are used to managing. If not, we would have all died,” he said. “Nigerians care for themselves, we’re more like infants that have no father or mother.”\n\nAuthorities in Bayelsa say they are racing to provide relief items for the thousands displaced.\n\nAccording to the local government, around 20,000 people now live in displacement camps, where they are provided “two meals daily” along with “medical services, potable water and other emergency aids.”\n\nBut for Zibokere, government efforts are rarely felt in her community.\n\n“When relief items are sent to the community by the government, individuals handling them distribute most of it to their relatives. The rest of us are left in hunger,” she said.\n\nBayelsa government spokesperson Daniel Alabrah said the government was aware of these complaints.\n\n“We hear some of those complaints but we cannot verify them because while some claim not to have gotten the relief materials, others say they got it,” Alabrah told CNN. “These reports help us to monitor the process to see that relief materials get to the persons they are intended for,” he added.\n\nWith the rains still coming and more expected through November, more intense flooding is imminent, the Nigerian government warns.", "authors": ["Nimi Princewill Larry Madowo", "Nimi Princewill", "Larry Madowo", "Complaints Leveled At Authorities"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

Steadiness\n\nWith your iPhone in your pocket, the Health app uses custom algorithms to assess your balance, strength, and gait. You can set up a notification if your level of steadiness drops. That’s important because that could mean you’re more at risk of falling.\n\nHere’s how to set up Steadiness Notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app and tap your profile at the top right. If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom, then scroll back to the top.\n\n• Tap Health Checklist.\n\n• Tap Set Up for Walking Steadiness Notifications and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nIs carrying your phone in your pocket (guys) or your bra (ladies) safe? Here’s my answer.\n\n2. Heart rate variability\n\nHeart rate variability, or HRV, measures time intervals between heartbeats when you’re at rest. Your Apple Watch checks for irregular rhythms, sends you a notification and records the data in the Health app.\n\nIrregular rhythms could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Seriously dangerous stuff.\n\nHere’s how to check up on your HRV data:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Heart Rate Variability.\n\n• At the top, choose to view your data by day, week, month, half-year, and year.\n\nHere’s how to enable irregular rhythm notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Irregular Rhythm Notifications.\n\n• Once enabled, turn irregular rhythm notifications on or off in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then go to Heart > Irregular Rhythm.\n\nA nursing student said an Apple Watch notification helped detect a rare abnormality. Amazing stuff.\n\n3. High and low heart rates\n\nYour Apple Watch checks for low and high heart rates that could indicate an underlying condition. You can be notified when your heart rate goes above 120 bpm or drops below 40 bpm while inactive for 10 minutes.\n\nYou can turn on heart rate notifications when you first open the Heart Rate app on your Apple Watch or at any time from your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap the My Watch tab, then tap Heart.\n\n• Tap High Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n• Tap Low Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n4. Respiratory rate\n\nYour respiratory rate refers to the number of times you breathe in a minute. This goes up as you exercise and down as you sleep. When you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it automatically measures and records your respiratory rate.\n\nWhen your respiratory rate is significantly higher or lower than usual while you sleep, it could indicate illness or a health condition.\n\nTo track your respiratory rate, you’ll need to set up the sleep features on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Get Started under Set Up Sleep and tap Next.\n\n• Follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n• Turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch.

After a humiliating end to her engagement, investment banker Sidney Sinclair is done with commitment-phobic men. But when her sister winds up engaged after a whirlwind courtship, Sidney is thrown into close contact with exactly the kind of sexy playboy she wants to avoid—the gorgeous best man.

And it doesn't help her happily-ever-after that she's masquerading as her married, three-months-pregnant sister.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/18/panda-versary-prison-tattoo-artist-conch-republic-news-around-states/50084859/", "title": "Panda-versary, prison tattoo artist: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Southern Poverty Law Center unveiled an interactive statue at the downtown Civil Rights Memorial Center on Tuesday. The Blank Slate Monument, created by Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo, contests the narratives that Civil War memorials present. It is is described as “a reimagining of the American monument; interrogating the traditional white supremacist commemoration of the American Civil War.” A digital sign within the piece allows users to change its message using their phones. “The Civil Rights Memorial Center is honored to bring the Blank Slate Monument to Alabama and specifically Montgomery – a city critical to the civil rights movement and a city continuing to respond to injustices of today,” said Tafeni English, CRMC director. “This monument serves as a reminder of the continued struggle for the liberation of Black people and the importance of preserving the truthful, rich history of Black Americans.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The board tasked with drawing the state’s political boundaries has approved new Alaska Senate districts for the Anchorage area, with two members expressing opposition. The Alaska Redistricting Board adopted the plan, 3-2, on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The board had gone back to work after the state Supreme Court ruled that a Senate district pairing part of east Anchorage and the Eagle River area constituted an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The new plan would join part of the Eagle River area with south Anchorage and Girdwood for one Senate district and another part of the Eagle River area to an area that includes a military base for another Senate district. The board’s dissenting members said the plan would improperly give Eagle River greater representation in the Senate. “This is still gerrymandering, just in a different way, in my mind,” board member Melanie Bahnke said. The board had been considering two options to address concerns raised by the court. The other option would have joined the Eagle River area’s two House districts into one Senate district. Two House districts make up one Senate district. If the new plan is upheld, Republican Sens. Lora Reinbold, of Eagle River, and Roger Holland, of Anchorage, would be in the same district.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Prosecutors have asked the state Supreme Court to call off an upcoming hearing scheduled by a lower-court judge to determine the mental fitness of a prisoner to be executed in what would be Arizona’s first use of the death penalty in nearly eight years. Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office told the state’s highest court in a filing Wednesday that the May 3 mental competency hearing scheduled in Pinal County for death-row prisoner Clarence Dixon is likely to delay his May 11 execution. Dixon was sentenced to death for his murder conviction in the 1977 killing of Arizona State University student Deana Bowdoin. The prosecutors are seeking to throw out the lower court’s order that concluded defense lawyers had shown reasonable grounds for planning a hearing over whether Dixon is psychologically fit. Dixon’s lawyers have said their client erroneously believes he will be executed because police at Northern Arizona University wrongfully arrested him in a previous case – a 1985 attack on a 21-year-old student. His attorneys concede he was in fact lawfully arrested then by Flagstaff police. Dixon was sentenced to life sentences in that case for sexual assault and other convictions. DNA samples taken while he was in prison later linked him to Bowdoin’s killing, which at that point had been unsolved.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: U.S. Sen. John Boozman raised $1.1 million over the past three months for his reelection campaign as he continued to surpass his rivals in fundraising for the Republican primary next month, according to federal fundraising records. Boozman’s campaign reported having $2.5 million on hand at the end of March after spending $2.1 million during the first quarter. Friday was the deadline for candidates to file quarterly fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. Boozman, first elected to the Senate in 2010, has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump and the state’s top Republicans. Jake Bequette, a former NFL and Arkansas Razorbacks player challenging Boozman, reported raising nearly $344,000 during the quarter and spending almost $200,000. Bequette’s campaign had more than $555,000 on hand. A super PAC supporting Bequette’s bid also spent more than $1.1 million on television ads. Another Senate hopeful, conservative activist and former TV reporter Jan Morgan, raised more than $215,000 during the quarter. Morgan’s campaign spent $221,000 and had $54,751 on hand. Stuttgart pastor Heath Loftis gave his Senate campaign more than $20,000 and raised another $1,100. Loftis had $1,560 on hand.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A spring storm brought several feet of snow to the Sierra Nevada and rain to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, with more stormy weather expected this week. The seven-day snow total topped 3 feet in some mountain areas as of Saturday, UC Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab reported. “We’re getting a bit of an abundant April!” the research station in Soda Springs said on Twitter. Mammoth Mountain in the eastern Sierra reported a foot of fresh snow. The resort has said it would remain open to skiing and snowboarding until Memorial Day. Lake Tahoe resorts also reported significant snowfall. Drivers heading up to the mountains were urged to use caution because of slippery conditions. Parts of Northern California including the Bay Area could see pockets of rain for much of the week thanks to an unsettled weather pattern stalling over the region, the National Weather Service said. The welcome precipitation could help slow the start of the fire season but won’t do anything to alleviate the state’s drought, said Matt Mehle with the weather service office in San Francisco. “What this rain is doing is bringing moisture and allowing grasses and finer fuels to grow and green up,” Mehle told the San Francisco Chronicle. “It will alleviate fire concerns, at least for the short term.”\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A judge ruled Friday that a man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still mentally incompetent to stand trial, further delaying court proceedings in the case. But the judge also said that assessment could change soon. Experts at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo have said there is a substantial probability that Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 22, can be restored to competency within the “reasonable future” and remain competent by taking medications, Judge Ingrid Bakke said during a brief hearing. It is a prognosis she first mentioned in a March 11 scheduling order. The prosecution of Alissa has been on hold since December, when Bakke first ruled he was mentally incompetent – unable to understand legal proceedings and work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa is being treated at the state mental hospital and was not in court for Friday’s hearing. The judge set a July 21 hearing to again evaluate Alissa’s competency to stand trial. Bakke’s ruling came nearly a month after Boulder, the home of the University of Colorado, marked the first anniversary of the attack that killed workers, customers and a police officer who rushed inside the store.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones will be getting back the $75,000 in fines he paid to a court for failing to appear at a deposition last month in a lawsuit over his assertions that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax, a judge has ruled. Relatives of some of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 Newtown massacre sued Jones for defamation, saying they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers. A judge found Jones liable for damages, and a trial on how much he should pay the families is set for August. Judge Barbara Bellis in Waterbury ordered the return of the money Thursday because Jones eventually did show at a rescheduled deposition. The fines, which escalated daily, were aimed at making sure Jones did appear for questioning. Jones said he missed the March 23-24 deposition in Austin, Texas – home to Jones and Infowars – because of a medical problem that included vertigo. He said his doctors first thought it was a serious heart issue, but it later turned out to be a sinus infection. Bellis said there wasn’t enough evidence Jones was too ill to attend the deposition. Jones paid a $25,000 daily fine for April 1 and another $50,000 daily fine for April 4. He then attended a deposition in Bridgeport on April 5-6.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Wilmington University will continue to prioritize science, technology, engineering and mathematics education as the school announced its partnership with Futures First Gaming, which will create degree and certificate pathways for students in the esports and gaming communities. The partnership announced April 11 will provide students with education and training in a variety of areas that pertain to the esports industry. “The agreement between WilmU and FFG leverages the capabilities of both to ensure there’s academic rigor that benefits students with and without esports and game design credentials,” Scott Shaw, assistant professor and academic chair of WilmU’s Game Design program, said in a press release. “There’s so much more to it beyond programming and game design, and this agreement provides pathways to educational credit for skill-building, and opportunities to gain a wider perspective of the industry.” FFG was co-founded in February 2020 by CEO Stephen Sye, who said the company’s goal was to spread the reach of esports, a form of competition using video games, to the state of Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fifty years after pandas first took up residence in the nation’s capital, the Smithsonian National Zoo celebrated the “Panda-versary” with its beloved bears Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their baby Xiao Qi Ji – which means “little miracle” – enjoyed a fruit-and-ice cake as part of the commemoration. The first pair of pandas arrived in D.C. on April 16, 1972, thanks to a deal between first lady Patricia Nixon and the Chinese premier. Since then, the mammals have become the most popular attraction at the Smithsonian National Zoo. Their 50 years have improved relations with China through what’s been called “panda diplomacy,” bolstering conservation efforts and ingraining the bears into Washington’s identity. “For me, the birth of Xiao Qi Ji was pretty spectacular,” said the zoo’s chief curato,r Brian Amaral. “During my entire (five-year) tenure here, we’ve tried to have panda cubs, and for various reasons that we are not sure of, we were not successful, but August of 2020 changed all that, so that was pretty amazing.” In 2021, pandas were downgraded from endangered to vulnerable status by Chinese conservation officials, although they still face many threats, including the threat of climate change to the bamboo forests where they live.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The 40th anniversary celebration of the Florida Keys’ symbolic secession from the United States, motivated by a 1982 U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint established on the only road connecting the Keys with mainland Florida, has begun in Key West. The 10-day Conch Republic Independence Celebration kicked off Friday with a waterfront ceremony at the island city’s Mallory Square. The offbeat republic was born April 23, 1982, shortly after a Border Patrol checkpoint was erected at the top of the Florida Keys Overseas Highway, the lower end of U.S. Highway 1. Agents ostensibly searched departing cars for drugs and other contraband. The obstacle created a miles­long traffic jam that enraged Keys officials, visitors and residents. After appeals to remove the roadblock were denied by federal officials, Key West’s then-Mayor Dennis Wardlow led local leaders in staging the tongue-in-cheek secession, proclaiming the independent Conch Republic and raising its royal blue flag. “We made the announcement that if we’re going to be treated as a foreign country, then we will become a foreign country,” said Wardlow, who was named the republic’s first “prime minister.” The roadblock was subsequently removed, and the eccentric “nation” is now internationally recognized as the Florida Keys’ irreverent alter ego. “It’s been 40 years, and the people are still supporting the republic,” Wardlow said after Friday’s ceremony. “And the government has not put up any border checkpoints, and they haven’t messed with us.” Festivities will continue through April 24 with events including a pirates’ ball, a wacky drag queen footrace and a sailing regatta that recalls the Keys’ seafaring heritage.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The police chief will retire this summer as the city struggles to tamp down its rising homicide rate and as residents on the north side of the city consider seceding to form their own entity, largely over crime concerns. Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant will retire in June, and a nationwide search for his replacement will be conducted, Mayor Andre Dickens’ office announced Friday. “As Mayor Dickens plans his leadership strategies for this great city, I believe it is essential that he and the city of Atlanta have a Chief of Police who is willing to serve throughout his term,” Bryant said in a statement. When he took office, the mayor said he would assess Bryant’s performance in his first 100 days before deciding whether to keep him long term or search for a new chief, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Dickens said he’s looking for a leader who shares his vision for the city. “I am thankful that the chief agreed to stay on for my first 100 days as Mayor, and I have grown to rely on the Chief’s counsel during our daily meetings,” Dickens said in the statement. “We will miss the Chief’s leadership as he enjoys his well-earned retirement.” Bryant, an Atlanta native, joined the department in 1988 and rose to become a major in 2010 and a deputy chief in 2014. Bryant was named the department’s interim chief in June 2020.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A COVID-19 omicron variant hybrid called XE has been detected in the state, the Hawaii Department of Health said. The department’s laboratories division confirmed one case of XE in its latest coronavirus variant report, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The hybrid contains genetic material from both BA.1 and BA.2 variants. The department found it in a sample collected last month. The XE subvariant is believed to be about 10% more transmissible than BA.2, which itself is about 30% more contagious than the original omicron. It was first detected in the United Kingdom. Infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said XE doesn’t appear to have more severe effects than other versions of the virus. A recombinant variant occurs when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within the patient’s body, according to the UK Health Security Agency. It’s not unusual for this to happen, the agency said in a news release. XE is a recombinant lineage of BA.1 and BA.2, with the majority of its genome, including the gene encoding for the spike protein, coming from BA.2, the report said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Friday that he won’t participate in debates heading into next month’s Republican primary. The first-term governor had been invited to participate in debates put on by Idaho Debates on Idaho Public Television and by KTVB-TV. “Governor Little has a proven track record of cutting red tape, responsibly managing the budget and the economy, and providing Idaho families and businesses with historic tax relief and record investments in schools, roads, water, and other areas,” his campaign said in a statement. “Those historic accomplishments and facts are non-debatable.” Little has drawn several Republican challengers, including far-right Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The governor and lieutenant governor run on separate tickets. Little has a significant fundraising advantage, and debating McGeachin in a statewide televised debate could give her a big platform with not much to gain for himself. The two have sparred during the coronavirus pandemic, with McGeachin as acting governor issuing several executive orders while Little was out of town. Little rescinded McGeachin’s orders each time upon his return. McGeachin, who has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump, tweeted that Little’s decision wasn’t based on “a scheduling conflict” and said he was “showing his elitist attitude.” After Little’s announcement, Idaho Debates officials said it was unclear if the governor’s debate would be held without Little, and they were conferring with other candidates. They said it was the first time in more than three decades that a sitting governor seeking reelection had declined to participate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A fire that roared through a prominent church on the South Side was sparked by a propane torch on the building’s roof, the Chicago Fire Department said Saturday. “The CFD Office of Fire Investigation has determined the fire at Antioch Church to be accidental and caused by work being done on the building roof using a propane torch,” the department said on Twitter. The multiple-alarm fire blaze at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church began after 2 p.m. Friday, an hour after services ended, and wasn’t brought under control for 90 minutes. Exactly three years prior, the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was severely damaged after a fire broke out beneath its roof. “This church is an anchor in this community,” Antioch’s pastor, the Rev. Gerald Dew, told reporters at the scene. “If we’ve got to lose something, losing it on Good Friday is the best time to lose it because after Good Friday comes Resurrection Sunday.” No one appeared to be inside at the time of the fire, Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said. About 150 firefighters and 50 engines, trucks and ambulances went to the scene, he said. The only reported injury was a firefighter who slipped on the street, injured his ankle and was taken away in an ambulance, Langford said. The South Side church is well-known for its political clout and community involvement, investing in several housing projects starting in the 1960s. It provides over 1,500 units of affordable housing for seniors, the physically handicapped and for families, Dew said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana State Fair will celebrate the state’s automotive heritage this year. Fairgoers can expect to see iconic celebrity cars from movies and books and world-class classic car collections showcasing Indiana-made vehicles, the fair announced this past week. During the first decades of the 20th century, more than 250 automobile manufacturers opened in the state, including Duesenberg, Stutz, Cord, Auburn and Studebaker, according to Indiana Landmarks, a historic preservation group. This year’s fair will run from Friday, July 29, through Sunday, Aug. 21. It’s closed Mondays and Tuesdays.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Hundreds of American white pelicans are visiting the Iowa River, delighting the city’s residents with their snowy feathers and prominent yellow bills. “They are a big white bird that from behind looks like a swan,” said Anna Burkhardt-Thomas, the state’s top bird expert within the Iowa Department of Natural Resources wildlife diversity staff. “That really long yellow beak with a pouch for fish is a key feature.” For more than a week, the pelicans have been swimming in and flying around the Iowa River as far south as Terry Trueblood Recreation Area all the way north to the Coralville Lake. Large clusters of the birds loiter south of the dam in downtown Iowa City, where turbulent water stirs up fish. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reports this Midwest spring break is part of the pelicans’ migration from their winter habitat on the Gulf Coast shores to Minnesota or Canada, where they will spend the summer, Burkhardt-Thomas said. But pelicans don’t always come through Iowa in such large numbers, and they don’t always stay so long. “They might stick around longer if they are finding a good food source,” she said. American white pelicans have black flight feathers on the underside of their wings only visible when their wings are open. The birds have a 9-foot wingspan – larger than brown pelicans found near the ocean.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State funds for public schools have been held up as Republican lawmakers push for policies critics say would punish educators for court rulings that forced the GOP-controlled Legislature to boost its spending. A legislative proposal ties $6.4 billion in spending to policies pushed by conservative Republicans, including an “open enrollment” proposal to allow parents to send their children to any public school with enough space. Another provision would restrict surveys of students’ families, their beliefs, mental health, or drug or alcohol abuse. A third would expand a state-funded college scholarship program to students outside Kansas. Republicans drafted the measure before lawmakers began their annual spring break earlier this month, to settle differences between the House and Senate. When legislators reconvene April 25, they must decide whether to add more money for special education programs and whether to link dollars to policy changes. Conservatives argue they are trying to make schools more accountable for how they spend state money. They’ve been linking money to policy since 2014, when the Kansas Supreme Court issued the first of seven rulings in an education funding lawsuit filed against the state by four school districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A jury has awarded $450,000 to a man who sued his employer after he asked that it not celebrate his birthday at work, and colleagues did it anyway. Kevin Berling told his manager at Gravity Diagnostics in Covington in 2019 that a birthday celebration would cause him immense stress, citing bad childhood memories surrounding his parents’ divorce. But the company didn’t heed his request, and Berling suffered a panic attack. The next day he had another panic attack when his supervisor chastised him for “stealing his co-workers’ ” joy and “being a little girl,” according to a lawsuit. Berling was fired after the second attack. He alleged in his lawsuit that the company discriminated against him based on a disability and retaliated against him for demanding a reasonable accommodation to it. The jury returned the verdict after a two-day trial in Kenton County that ended in late March. The jury awarded him $300,000 for emotional distress and $150,000 in lost wages. An attorney for the company, Katherine Kennedy, said it continues to deny liability and is pursuing its post-trial options. Brazil said her employees, rather than the plaintiff, were the victims in the case. Berling’s attorney, Tony Bucher, said once the jury got to meet his client, they realized the company’s claim that he posed a threat was far-fetched.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaurice: A high school senior who lost her best friend in a head-on collision is on a mission to improve safety on Highway 167. Emma Hebert and Ramsie Baumgardner both attended North Vermillion High, and Baumgardner became the third high schooler killed on that highway in the past four years. She was 18. Some sections of the state highway are uneven and unlit. Hebert is one of the people in the Maurice community fighting for change. She joined others at a Vermilion Parish Police Jury meeting in February to discuss adding lights and other ways to increase safety, but she left feeling as if nothing would be done. “I wanted (action), so nobody else has to go through what we went through,” Hebert said. She turned her final paper for her dual-enrollment English class into a persuasive argument to put lights and better signage on the highway. “The lack of lighting and signage on highway 167 makes it perilous, and it is imperative that state and local authorities take action to prevent head-on collisions,” Hebert wrote. She collected police data on highway crashes and learned about the dangers and prevalence of impaired driving. The information fills a large binder, along with more than 1,100 responses to an online survey she posted last month. More than half of those responding identified as 16 to 22 years old. Most were fine with the highway during the day, but a resounding majority said they felt unsafe at night. The main difference is lighting, Herbert said.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The trail network at Acadia National Park is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service said Thursday that the listing recognizes 109 trails that cover 117 miles. The network becomes the largest system of trails listed on the register. The park service said the trail system was recognized because of its historic significance and ties to the history of Mount Desert Island, where the park is located. Kevin Schneider, superintendent of Acadia National Park, said in a statement that the recognition “is a testament to not only the historic significance of these trails, but also the incredible dedication of the National Park Service staff, partners and volunteers who continue to preserve them.” The park service worked for several years to nominate the trails to the register. It was approved last week.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A container ship longer than three football fields has finally been pried from the muddy bottom of the Chesapeake Bay more than a month after it ran aground. After two unsuccessful attempts to dislodge it and the subsequent removal of roughly 500 of the 5,000 containers it was carrying, the Ever Forward was refloated just before 7 a.m. Sunday by two barges and five tugboats. A full moon and high spring tide helped provide a lift to the salvage vessels as they pulled and pushed the massive ship from the mud, across a dredged hole and back into the shipping channel. Once refloated, the Ever Forward was weighed down again by water tanks to ensure safe passage under the Chesapeake Bay Bridge on its way to an anchorage off Annapolis, The Baltimore Sun reports. Marine inspectors will examine the ship’s hull before the Coast Guard allows it to return to the Port of Baltimore to retrieve the offloaded containers. The cargo ship, operated by Taiwan-based Evergreen Marine Corp., was traveling from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, on March 13 when it ran aground just north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Officials have said the grounding did not result in reports of injuries, damage or pollution. The Coast Guard has not said what caused the Ever Forward to run aground.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legislation outlining steps the state needs to take to meet its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 cleared a key hurdle late Thursday when the Massachusetts Senate voted 37-3 to approve the sweeping climate bill. The bill’s passage sets the stage for negotiations with the House, which last month passed its own, more narrowly focused bill. Both Democratic-led chambers hope to come up with a single compromise proposal to ship to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker before the end for the Legislature’s formal session on July 31. The Senate bill tries to address climate change in three areas: renewable energy, transportation and buildings. The bill would set aside $100 million for an investment fund to support the clean energy industry while updating the process of bringing more offshore wind energy online. It would allow solar panels on agricultural and horticultural land and supporting emerging technologies like nuclear fusion, networked geothermal and deep geothermal energy. It would also increase to $3,500 the rebate for the purchase of many zero-emission passenger cars and light-duty trucks, offer another $1,000 for buyers trading in an internal combustion vehicle, deploy more car charging stations across the state, and require new developments to allocate 10% of parking spaces to charging stations. The bill aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels in the construction of buildings by letting a handful of communities participate in two demonstration projects.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Four Michiganders – a taxidermist, his wife and two mink farm employees – were infected with a unique coronavirus strain connected to minks, leading state health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conclude they likely contracted the first known U.S. cases of so-called animal-to-human virus spillover. Michigan’s four mink-connected COVID-19 cases, the only known animal-to-human cases in the U.S. to date, infected more people than was previously known. The Detroit Free Press and the Documenting COVID-19 project first reported on the mink cases in April 2021, after discovering details about them in Freedom of Information Act requests, and National Geographic confirmed last month that four cases with the same genetic mutations had been linked together. All four people fully recovered. There have been other animal-to-human COVID-19 cases documented with white-tailed deer in Canada and a hamster in Japan. While Michigan’s cases are the only known animal-connected COVID-19 cases in the U.S., there could be other cases that have gone unreported, as the country is not actively testing for such outbreaks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State corrections officials are looking to launch a prison tattoo program in hopes of curbing bloodborne diseases as inmates ink themselves with homemade tools. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the Corrections Department is searching for an experienced tattoo artist to oversee tattoo studios in state prisons. The aim is to slow the spread of diseases like hepatitis C that can spread when inmates try to tattoo themselves or each other with unsterilized tools like electric motors and ballpoint pens and share contaminated needles. Corrections spokesman Nick Kimball said as of January, anywhere from 1,200 to 3,500 of the prison system’s 7,511 inmates were infected with hepatitis C. The prison system treats about 80 to 100 inmates for the disease each at a cost ranging from $20,000 to $75,000 per inmate.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: Technology donations are giving a boost to a nonprofit organization that provides education programs for Hispanic residents. El Centro, in Tupelo, is receiving three years of free internet access and a $50,000 grant from AT&T and 15 computers from Dell Technologies, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. “It opens up a lot more possibilities for us and for us to be able to tell the community, ‘Whatever you have a need for, we can provide it,’ ” El Centro Director Allen Bradford said Thursday of the donation. El Centro, started in 2006, provides free after-school tutoring and services, adult English classes and workshops on topics relevant to the community. The computers came with a free digital learning platform, free digital literacy courses and workshops created with the Public Library Association. El Centro becomes one of more than 20 Connected Learning Centers that AT&T is opening nationwide. The company created its Connected Learning program in response to COVID-19 and the need to bridge the digital divide, said AT&T Mississippi president Mayo Flynt. El Centro helps K-6 students with homework because it can be difficult for students who grow up in bilingual homes and communities, Bradford said. During the pandemic, some fell behind when learning at home.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: City Council member Mike Huff is suing to retain his seat after one of the winning candidates died shortly after the election. Huff was one of four candidates who ran for two council seats in the April 5 election. He came in third, behind fellow member Karen DeLuccie and newcomer Jared Fears. DeLuccie died of cancer April 12, the same day the election results were certified. In a lawsuit filed Thursday, Huff said the Jackson County Election Board and the Independence city clerk should not have certified DeLuccie as the winner because she was incapacitated by her illness, The Kansas City Star reports. Huff argues he should be declared the winner of the second at-large seat. DeLuccie’s family said after her death that her lung cancer prognosis in early February was positive. But after a scan April 7, two days after the election, showed that treatments had not worked, she decided to stop treatment and spend time with her family. Sara Zorich, a director at the Jackson County Election Board, said the city will have to decide how to proceed. The City Council is expected to vote this week on whether to hold a special election.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped 0.3 percentage points in March to 2.3% as it continued to hit new record lows, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Friday. The number of unemployed people in the state fell to 13,106 – a decline of 1,162 people from February. Montana’s unemployment rate in recent months has been the lowest since records started being kept in 1976. Also in March, the state’s total employment hit a new high at 545,360 workers. That’s up by more than 3,200 workers compared to February. The U.S. unemployment rate was 3.6% in March, down 0.2 percentage points from February’s rate. Inflation has risen 8.5% over the past 12 months, a 40-year high. That’s driven prices sharply higher for purchases including gasoline, airfare, used cars and trucks and fuel oil.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts has signed off on a $900 million property and income tax cut package. Ricketts said the bill will provide nearly $1 billion in annual tax relief once it is fully implemented. The measure will reduce the top individual and corporate income tax rates to 5.84% by 2027. Currently, the highest individual rate is 6.84%, and the top corporate rate is 7.5%. Property owners will also receive a refundable tax credit to reimburse them for some of the taxes they pay to community colleges, and the law will speed up the state’s plan to phase out taxes on Social Security income. That tax will now by eliminated by 2025. Some senators raised concerns how the tax cut will affect the state budget in future years, but lawmakers ultimately passed the package.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state panel has endorsed an agency’s request for funding to expand Gov. Steve Sisolak’s security team. The Board of Examiners’ vote last Tuesday forwards the Department of Public Safety’s request for $373,051 to the Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The department wants to expand Sisolak’s security detail to eight positions by adding a sergeant and two officers. A department memo cited “various national threat alerts” and referenced two incidents in which Sisolak and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo were separately accosted and verbally attacked in public. “Recently our own state experienced verbal attacks on elected officials in a public place,” the memo said. “A recent assessment of the Dignitary Protection operation by the Capital Police Chief revealed the need for expanding the protective team. With this being an election year, the need for stronger protective services is critical to protect Governor and First Family.” Sisolak, a Democrat, is running for reelection this year, while Lombardo is a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor. The Board of Examiners consists of Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some business owners struggling to hire workers are lining up behind Gov. Chris Sununu’s plan to use $100 million in federal funds to increase the state’s housing stock. In the two months since Sununu announced the initiative, the state’s unemployment rate has fallen to 2.5%, while the vacancy rate for a two-bedroom apartment fell to under 1%. That’s been tough on companies like Boyce Highlands, which makes architectural moldings in Concord and recently acquired a lumber company in Brentwood. “Our plan in five years is to double the size of that operation, but with very limited housing, it’s very difficult to attract good quality workers,” co-owner Brien Murphy said at a news conference Wednesday. While New Hampshire is one of the region’s fastest growing states, the lack of affordable housing continues to be an obstacle, said Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the Department of Business and Economic Affairs. Half of the total would go to developers of multifamily projects with at least five units, with preference given to projects aimed at lower- and middle-income workers. Another $40 million would go to towns and cities, including $30 million to encourage them to approve projects quickly. Another $10 million would help communities update zoning regulations or demolish vacant, dilapidated buildings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Police officers will be allowed to purchase and consume marijuana once it’s officially and legally for sale in the state, just like any other potential customer, under the recreational weed laws passed last year. On Thursday, acting New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a memo alerting police chiefs that law enforcement agencies “may not take any adverse action against any officers because they do or do not use cannabis off duty,” which was codified in the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act. Police officers are barred from possessing or using marijuana while on the clock and from performing any work while under the influence. The marijuana legalization laws allow any employer to maintain a drug-free workplace and puts into place procedures for suspected drug use while on the job. Platkin’s memo reminds police chiefs they have the same rights. But a drug test must accompany a physical examination as well, as THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can stay in the bloodstream for weeks. A positive drug test could mean the police officer smoked a joint on the way to the station or simply ate a cannabis-infused gummy at an off-duty barbecue a month ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An appeals court on Friday uphold a lower court’s rejection of two ranching groups’ challenge to a federal agency’s designation of certain riparian areas of Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico as critical habitat of a mouse species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016 designated nearly 22 square miles in the three states as critical habitat of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. The decision by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a U.S. District Court judge correctly rejected the challenge by two New Mexico ranching groups, the Northern New Mexico Stockman’s Association and the Otero County Cattleman’s Association. Livestock grazing can damage mouse habitat, and its protected status has prompted federal managers in some areas to restrict access to streams and wetlands. The appeals court said the Fish and Wildlife Service complied with legal requirements for assessing economic impacts of critical habitat designation, adequately considered the effects on ranchers’ water rights and “reasonably supported its decision not to exclude certain areas from the critical habitat designation.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former union boss for the nation’s largest correction officers’ union might have gotten too harsh a prison sentence when he was ordered to spend nearly five years behind bars for corruption convictions, a judge said. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, who sentenced Seabrook to four years and 10 months in prison in early 2019, said in a ruling Friday that the length of Norman Seabrook’s prison term deserves a second look. He noted disparities in the sentence given to Seabrook, who is Black, and co-conspirators who are white. But he also said in a written ruling that the former head of the New York City Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association did not deserve a new trial after his 2018 conviction on conspiracy and honest service wire fraud charges. Prosecutors said he accepted $60,000 in bribes in 2014 to funnel $20 million in union funds to a risky hedge fund. All but $1 million was lost. Seabrook has said there was no evidence he ever intended to “lose a dime” of union members’ money. In October 2021, Seabrook asked Hellerstein to grant him a new trial on several grounds including ineffective assistance of counsel and unjust rulings against him, which Hellerstein said in his Friday ruling all fall “well short of the mark.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Three primates suffered frostbite while enduring subfreezing conditions this year at an exotic animal farm operated by a county commissioner that has been repeatedly cited by federal inspectors. The latest citations, involving a black and white ruffed lemur, a De Brazza’s monkey and a capuchin, were issued in March by the U.S. Department of Agriculture against Zootastic Park of Lake Norman, The Charlotte Observer reports. “The lemur’s hand was injured and remains contracted while the De Brazza’s and capuchin suffered the loss of their tail tips,” according to a copy of the federal inspection report, obtained by the animal welfare group PETA. Scottie Brown, the Iredell County commissioner who owns the park outside Charlotte, didn’t reply to a phone message from the newspaper Thursday. In another instance, the inspector saw a young howler monkey “hugging a live electric cord that was connected to a heating pad inside its enclosure.” That could have hurt or killed the monkey, the inspector wrote. The USDA also cited Zootastic for medicating animals without a veterinarian present, allowing visitors unsupervised access to some animals, and failing to document its purchase or disposal of at least a dozen animals, the inspection reports show.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two North Dakota Army National Guard soldiers are being recognized for saving migrants from drowning at the southern border of the United States last month. Spc. Luis Alvarado, of Bismarck, and Spc. Gracin Clem, of Dickinson, were conducting surveillance for U.S. Customs and Border Protection on March 22 when they observed five migrants attempting to cross the Rio Grande River, the National Guard said. The migrants were halfway across the river but struggled to stay above water due to strong currents and high winds. The two men were equipped with nylon rope lifelines, and Clem swam a line out to help the people that were struggling. The soldiers rescued two people as the other three managed to get to safety. “There wasn’t time to be scared,” Clem said. “It wasn’t an option.” Alvarado and Clem are assigned to the North Dakota National Guard’s 957th Engineer Company and have been part of the southwest border mission since the fall of 2021. “These heroic actions demonstrate the unyielding commitment of our Guard members to preserve lives while in the service of our nation,” said Maj. Gen. Al Dohrmann, North Dakota adjutant general. “Our entire chain of command is extremely proud of the actions of all our soldiers.”\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Ohio State University will pay $2 million to settle more lawsuits brought by men who said they were sexually abused decades ago by now-deceased team doctor Richard Strauss, increasing the number of survivors who’ve reached settlement agreements to nearly 290. The payouts by the university have now reached just under $60 million to former athletes and other men who alleged Strauss carried out the abuse at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and an off-campus clinic. The latest settlement announced Friday ends lawsuits brought by 57 survivors whose cases had been dismissed by a federal judge who last year ruled that the legal window for such claims had passed. Dozens of men whose cases were dismissed have appealed that decision and have yet to reach settlements. The hundreds of survivors who have sued the university said it failed to stop Strauss despite students raising concerns during his 20 years at Ohio State as far back as the late 1970s. No one has publicly defended Strauss, who died in 2005. Ohio State has said that a law firm investigation for the university and lawsuits filed against the school have revealed more than 170 total instances of rape and more than 2,600 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Republican Scott Pruitt, the scandal-ridden former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, filed Friday to run for Oklahoma’s open U.S. Senate seat, making a return to politics in a state with deep ties to the oil and gas industry. Pruitt, 53, a former Oklahoma attorney general and outspoken supporter of the energy industry, is seeking the seat being vacated by longtime Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe. While Pruitt was attorney general, he filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the agency he was later picked to lead by ex-President Donald Trump. After arriving in Washington, he worked to dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations that aimed to reduce toxic pollution and planet-warming carbon emissions. Pruitt stepped down as EPA administrator in 2018 amid a wave of ethics scandals, including living in a bargain-priced Capitol Hill condo tied to an energy lobbyist. He also faced ethics investigations into pricey trips with first-class airline seats and unusual security spending, including a $43,000 soundproof booth for making private phone calls. And he demanded 24-hour-a-day protection from armed officers, resulting in a swollen 20-member security detail that blew through overtime budgets and racked up expenses of more than $3 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials at Oregon Health & Science University have apologized to employees after a fake phishing test drew complaints about raising false hopes. The university sent the phishing test email to employees April 12 offering up to $7,500 in financial assistance, Portland TV station KGW8 reports. The email, from a “benefit@ohsu.edu” address, read in part: “In response to the current community hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon Health & Science University has decided to assist all employees in getting through these difficult times.” It included a link where respondents could “register” for pandemic-related benefits. But the offer was not real – it was a test intended to measure employees’ cybersecurity awareness and OHSU’s own technology systems. The test was sent several days after the university sent a message to employees warning them about suspicious emails. The phishing test was met with frustration from some employees. In a statement, OHSU apologized and said the university didn’t fully consider the harm the phishing test could cause. “This week, as part of OHSU’s regular exercises to help members practice spotting suspicious e-mails, the language in the test e-mail was taken verbatim from an actual phishing e-mail to ensure no one else fell for the scam. That was a mistake,” the OHSU statement said. “The real scam was insensitive and exploitive of OHSU members – and the attempt to educate members felt the same way, causing confusion and concern.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An ad by one of three people seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor this year drew a complaint Friday and a sharply worded letter from the party’s presumed nominee for governor. The dispute pits Attorney General Josh Shapiro against state Rep. Brian Sims over Sims’ ad that the Shapiro campaign says falsely implies Shapiro has endorsed Sims. Shapiro took the unusual step earlier this year of endorsing and running with state Rep. Austin Davis of Allegheny County, even though in Pennsylvania candidates for governor and lieutenant governor are not paired on the primary ballot. So when the Shapiro camp noticed that “ENDORSED JOSH SHAPIRO,” along with a check-marked ribbon, appeared at the end of Sims’ new statewide ad, lawyers fired off a cease-and-desist order. “Not only does the ad mislead voters, it also places Attorney General Shapiro in a false light,” argued Courtney Weisman, a lawyer for Shapiro, in the letter sent Friday. She said Sims’ wording was designed to mislead Pennsylvanians. The ad began running on streaming services in markets around Pennsylvania this past week, Sims’ spokesperson said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Environmental Management plans to hire somebody who can recruit hunters and trappers, including women and people from minority communities. “We’re hiring! DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) is looking for an innovative self-starter with a strong human dimensions background to coordinate the state’s efforts to recruit, retain and reactivate (R3) outdoor enthusiasts, specifically hunters, trappers and shooting sportsmen and women,” the department said in a Facebook post. The job, which pays $71,487 for a 35-hour workweek, is consistent with a wider effort to encourage those outdoor sports. License fees for those activities and taxes on equipment help pay for wildlife management and land conservation, but Rhode Island and other states across the nation are seeing a drop in hunting, according to the DEM. “We’ve seen a tremendous decline in the number of people who participate in hunting,” said David Kalb, supervising wildlife biologist for the DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife. For example, Kalb said, the state sold 8,800 hunting licenses last year, a sizable drop from the peak of 11,600 in 2000. Revenue has decreased along with the drop in license sales, Kalb said, although he couldn’t immediately attach a dollar figure to it.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A prisoner scheduled to be the first man executed in the state in more than a decade has decided to die by firing squad rather than in the electric chair later this month, according to court documents filed Friday. Richard Bernard Moore, 57, is the also first South Carolina prisoner to face the choice of execution methods after a law went into effect last year making electrocution the default and giving inmates the option to face three prison workers with rifles instead. Moore has spent more than two decades on death row after being convicted of the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. If executed as scheduled April 29, he would be the first person put to death in the state since 2011 and the fourth in the country to die by firing squad in nearly half a century. Only three executions in the United States have been carried out by firing squad since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the center. In a statement, Moore said he didn’t concede that either method was legal or constitutional but more strongly opposed death by electrocution and only chose the firing squad because he was required to make a choice.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrookings: Rural communities are more vulnerable to economic effects from major historical events like the COVID-19 pandemic and recessions than urban communities, according to two local students’ research. Brookings High School seniors Will Hummel and Aditya Tummala will present their study, “The Disproportionate Effect of Labor Force Exodus on Rural America: A Study on the Implications of Pandemic-Era Recessions on Rural Midwest Communities,” next month at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in Atlanta. The May 8-13 fair is the world’s largest international pre-college science competition, hosting more than 1,500 high school students from 75 countries to share science projects of their own design. It will be the third time at the fair for Hummel and fourth time for Tummala, but it’s their first time together as a team. They also took this project to the Eastern South Dakota Science & Engineering Fair at South Dakota State University on March 22, securing the first grand prize award, earning them an all-expense-paid trip to the international fair. Hummel said because rural communities tend to base their economies on things like agriculture, mining or harvesting raw materials, like soybeans and corn, and then shipping those materials out, it leaves them more vulnerable to economic events.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State lawmakers are advancing a bill strictly limiting the shackling of pregnant inmates. The Republican-led Senate passed the legislation by Democratic Sen. Raumesh Akbari without opposition Thursday. The bill would generally prohibit restraints of a pregnant inmate. More specifically, a pregnant inmate’s ankles, legs or waist couldn’t be shackled during labor or delivery. The legislation also would not allow a pregnant inmate to be shackled behind the back or to be attached to another inmate. Some exceptions allowing restraints on a pregnant inmate would be when the inmate is moved within or outside of a facility, if the inmate is an immediate flight risk, if the inmate poses a self-threat or threat to the fetus or others, or if the classification level of the inmate requires restraints. In those cases, the bill says only the least restrictive restraints necessary should be used. The legislation still needs a vote from the House.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday repealed his traffic-clogging immigration order that backed up commercial trucks at the U.S.-Mexico border, after a week of intensifying backlash and fears of deepening economic losses. The Republican governor dropped his new rules that had required all commercial trucks from Mexico to undergo extra inspections to curb the flow of migrants and drugs and ratcheted up a fight with the Biden administration over immigration policy. Some truckers reported waiting more than 30 hours to cross. Others blocked one of the world’s busiest trade bridges in protest. Abbott, who is up for reelection in November and has made the border his top issue, fully lifted the inspections after reaching agreements with neighboring Mexican states that he said outline new commitments to border security. The last was signed with the governor of Tamaulipas, who earlier in the week said the inspections were overzealous and created havoc. On Friday, he joined Abbott and said they were ready to work together. Pressure was building on Abbott to retreat as gridlock on the border worsened. The American Trucking Association called the inspections “wholly flawed, redundant and adding considerable weight on an already strained supply chain.” One customs agency in Mexico estimated the losses at millions of dollars a day, and produce distributors warned of empty shelves and higher prices if the order was not rescinded soon.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: U.S. Sen. Mike Lee worked on early efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, helping to push legally dubious schemes to keep then-President Donald Trump in power, before he shifted course and quickly backed away. His efforts, revealed in text messages obtained by the House panel investigating the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, drew quick condemnation Friday from his reelection challengers. Text messages between the Utah senator and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows detail how Lee encouraged top Trump advisers to embrace Sidney Powell, a Republican lawyer who later spread wild and baseless claims of a rigged election. The messages from Lee to Meadows – and messages from Texas U.S. Rep. Chip Roy to Meadows – were reported on and published Friday by CNN. They show Lee’s efforts to assist Trump began Nov. 7 and included early support for Powell. Later, Lee explored a plan to encourage state legislatures to alter the outcome of the 2020 election by appointing alternate electors. At one point, Lee said he was working “14 hour days” assisting Trump. At another he asked Meadows: “Please tell me what I should be saying.” By mid-November, the messages show Lee beginning to lose confidence in Powell and, eventually, the alternate electors plan.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: After 50 years of helping to teach local students how to drive, a local high school’s driver’s education simulators have been put “out to pasture.” John Dunn posted pictures of the simulators languishing outside Essex High School in a Burlington Area History Facebook group last month and was flooded with comments from people who used the machines in school. The simulators, put into use in 1972 and taken out in 2022, were not just the only ones in Vermont – they were the oldest ones of their kind in use anywhere, according to Bill Mayville, who first used one as an EHS student in 1973 and then returned to the school to teach driver’s education for the next 39 years. The simulators were his main teaching tool. “I was sad to see them go, but I knew they were going to go,” he said. When the school first received the 12 simulators, “it was a big deal,” Mayville said. More were planned to come to the state, and Essex even had a driver’s education course planned for a field near the school. But the Nixon-era funds were frozen, according to Mayville, and Essex remained the only program in the state to have the simulators. Vermont State Police also trained on them, and they were used as an evaluation tool for teens with special needs or older adults to determine if they were capable of driving. One was handicap-equipped with full hand controls.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia Commonwealth University has received nearly $1 million in federal funds to study gun violence in the city as it experiences a spike in homicides. The money comes from the Omnibus Appropriations Agreement for the 2022 fiscal year approved by Congress this month, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. VCU’s project, the RVA Gun Violence Prevention Framework, aims to create a public health response to addressing the social, economic and systemic factors that lead to gun violence. The project is led by school representatives, VCU Health and the city of Richmond. Last year, Mayor Levar Stoney called gun violence a public health crisis, and the city allocated $133,000 toward the initiative. There were 101 slayings in the city last year, the most since 2004. Most involved guns. Richmond police classified 93 of the killings as homicides. In addition to intentional gun deaths, VCU Health reported last summer that it had seen a surprisingly high number of gun accidents. VCU also received $400,000 for a program seeking to support recruitment and training efforts of early childhood educators across central Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A hovering arctic jet stream has brought biting cold, snow, rain and hail that is concerning growers across central Washington’s Yakima Valley. Grower Mike Saunders with Apple King–Pro Orchard Management said orchards were laden with snow Wednesday, an unusual sight, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. Freezing temperatures began early last week with another cold snap expected this week. Growers have been using wind machines and smudge pots to warm the apple, pear and cherry orchards. Washington State Tree Fruit Association spokesperson Tim Kovis said the trees there are in bloom, but the cold is keeping the bees from pollinating, which is the biggest concern. “This is the window that is essential for the bees to be out in the orchards and pollinating those buds for the growing process,” he said. He said it’s still too early to assess the impact and said growers will know more this week. Not all orchards in the state are in the same dilemma, though they are facing freezing temperatures, Kovis said. Chelan, for example, has had snow, but fruit trees there have yet to bud, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Most of the protesters arrested at a power plant linked to U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin have settled trespassing cases. Twelve of the 16 protesters arrested last weekend at the Grant Town Power Plant in Marion County settled cases Friday, the activist group West Virginia Rising said. All 16 were arrested April 9 for trespassing after forming a human chain, The Dominion Post reports. The protest attracted about 200 people to call attention to the plant’s burning of low-grade coal, which emits more pollution. Manchin’s son runs the plant and burns the low-grade coal sold by Enersystems, the senator’s company. Manchin, Democrat, is chairman of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Among the protesters last week was J. Davitt McAteer, the former mine safety chief in the Clinton administration. McAteer said Manchin “appears to be contributing mightily to the problem (of coal pollution) while reaping untold benefits,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: The state Department of Natural Resources is ending its practice of posting volunteer guards along the Wolf River to protect spawning sturgeon from poachers. WLUK-TV reports Sturgeon for Tomorrow has been posting guards along the river around the clock each spring for decades in coordination with the DNR to protect the fish. DNR Regional Conservation Warden Ben Treml said there have been no major complaints or poaching cases for at least 15 years, and coordinating the volunteers is a lot of work, with notable difficulty in finding people willing to work overnight. He added that no volunteers have patrolled the river for the past two years during the pandemic. Jim Patt, president of the southwest chapter of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, said he’s not happy with the DNR’s decision. No one knows how much poaching is really going on, he said, and if word gets around that the guards aren’t on the river, any more poaching could increase.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The West’s oldest horse-drawn parade might become a relic after two years of pandemic-related cancellations. The Old West Days Parade drew just 22 entrants in 2019, when it was last held, and the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce is now trying to decide whether to bring the Memorial Day season event back, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The chamber is asking members of the ranching community to speak up if they want to keep the tradition going, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/26/poultry-pardons-synthetic-frogs-freedom-rocks-news-around-states/40708429/", "title": "Poultry pardons, synthetic frogs: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Researchers are once again trying to determine whether the state’s Black Belt region has a problem with intestinal parasites called hookworm. A study led by University of Alabama at Birmingham is recruiting participants for a program that will screen hundreds of children in Wilcox and Perry counties for signs of hookworm. State health officials took issue with a previous study involving Baylor University that found evidence of hookworm. The parasite was once widespread in the United States and is now a problem mainly in underdeveloped counties. Health officials say poor waste disposal systems and environmental conditions in rural west Alabama put the area at risk for the problem. UAB announced the new program in a statement this week. The work is being funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Southwest Alaska’s Mulchatna Caribou herd has decreased to less than half its numbers, leaving wildlife officials with suspicions but no clear answers. KYUK-AM reports there were more than 27,000 Mulchatna Caribou three years ago, and the figure is now only 13,500. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says causes could include the animals trampling their food, heavy predation from wolves and overhunting by humans. Officials say the caribou are roaming more in their western range near the Kuskokwim River and Bristol Bay region, an area with more communities than the eastern range. Fish and game officials say surveys indicate more people are hunting caribou than suggested by the 238 animals listed in 2018 harvest reports. State and federal managers plan to respond with restrictions to conserve the population.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The city will no longer use red-light and speed-enforcement cameras at intersections starting with the new year. A proposal to extend the contract for the cameras beyond Jan. 1 failed by a 4-5 City Council vote last week. Councilman Michael Nowakowski told KJZZ radio he voted against the extension because city staff never supplied him with the information he requested months ago. Phoenix has stationary red-light cameras at 12 intersections in addition to mobile speed-enforcement units that can be moved around school zones. Council briefing materials said the program generated more than $7 million in net income from Sept. 1, 2009, through Sept. 30, 2018, from more than 205,000 complaints filed in the city court about traffic violations.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: All University of Arkansas students are being required to have up-to-date vaccinations in order to attend classes following a mumps outbreak on campus. The state Department of Health on Friday issued a notice telling students they need to be immunized with at least two doses of the mumps vaccine or sit out of class for 26 days. The agency says nine cases of the viral disease have been diagnosed at the Fayetteville school this fall, and other possible cases are being investigated. University spokesman Zac Brown says the school has vaccination records for its roughly 27,000 students and has already contacted the 407 who don’t have current vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nArroyo Grande: Cal Fire alleges that fast food chain In-N-Out was responsible for a 2017 wildfire in this rural community, according to a lawsuit filed in San Luis Obispo Superior Court. The San Luis Obispo Tribune reports that Cal Fire claims the September 2017 wildfire was caused by a tractor mowing grass on In-N-Out property, saying it was covered in “dry annual grasses and scattered brush, which created a receptive bed of flammable vegetation.” The agency also claims that the tractor was improperly maintained and that the driver allowed the fire to spread. Cal Fire is seeking roughly $1.2 million from the burger chain to recoup costs. The fire burned about 245 acres in four days. In-N-Out did not respond to a request from the Tribune.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A survey of passengers who use the metro area’s regional transit system shows more of them would be willing to see service cuts if it leads to more reliable travel. The Denver Post reports the survey by the Regional Transportation District comes as the agency looks at whether and how to pursue service cuts amid one of its worst labor shortages in its 50-year history. RTD Director Judy Lubow called the situation an “emergency” that’s “just creaming us in terms of status and reputation.” In a survey of 13,000 people, 59% favored a temporary service reduction to better balance bus and train runs with RTD’s employee numbers. The respondents said they’d be willing, on average, to wait up to 18 minutes for a bus or light-rail train.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: A proposal to import five whales to the state has sparked a standoff between animal welfare groups and an aquarium that says the animals will contribute to its research. Mystic Aquarium wants to import the captive-born beluga whales from MarineLand of Canada in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The Connecticut aquarium, where belugas have been a popular attraction for generations, says the acquisition of the whales would enable research that helps protect the species. Animal Welfare Institute and other animal advocates disagree. They say the stress of importation would be too much for the whales, and it would make more sense for the scientists to come to the animals. The importation would require a federal permit, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is taking comments on the permit application until Dec. 2.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: More than 150 people are praying that the city reverses course on a ban that prohibits the display of a Nativity scene on city property. The mostly Catholic protesters gathered Thursday outside City Hall in Rehoboth Beach to ask officials to allow the display. They were joined by the Rev. William Cocco of St. Edmond Catholic Church, who asked city commissioners to let the creche return to its “proper place,” the Rehoboth Bandstand. The city ordered church officials to remove the display last December, saying it hadn’t been given permission to install the display in the first place. The city later announced plans to create an all-inclusive display for 2019. It’s unclear what progress, if any, has been made on that display.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Melania Trump opened the holiday season in the nation’s capital Monday by accepting delivery of the official White House Christmas tree. Members of the U.S. Marine Band played “O Christmas Tree” as a pair of horses named Cash and Ben trotted up the driveway pulling a green carriage that carried an 18 1/ 2 -foot Douglas fir. The towering tree will become the centerpiece of Christmas in the White House Blue Room. The first lady appeared moments later, escorted by a military aide, and smiled, waved and chatted up the top-hatted men holding tight to the reins. She walked around the carriage and paused to look at the tree before posing for photos with the Pennsylvania farmer who donated it, Larry Snyder of Mahantongo Valley Farms in Pitman, Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Port Richey: No frogs were harmed in the making of a local high school’s science class. J.W. Mitchell High School began using synthetic frogs for educational dissections last Wednesday. Pasco County Superintendent Kurt Browning says it’s the first school in the world to use the technology. The lives of real frogs are being spared at a cost of $150 per synthetic frog. Tampa-based developer SynDaver received funds from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to help create the “SynFrog.” SynDaver says the fake frogs are made of water, fibers and salts and can be reused. Founder and CEO Dr. Christopher Sakezles says the synthetic frogs are also safer because there are no potentially harmful chemicals. PETA says 3 million frogs are killed for classroom use each year.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: A state agency says it has money available to help fund projects that give people a closer view of the state’s wildlife. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources is taking applications for its Wildlife Viewing Grants Program through Jan. 15. The grants award up to $3,000 per project. The agency awarded money to six projects last year, including a viewing scope and platform at a nature center on Jekyll Island and a tower that provides shelter for federally protected migratory birds at Talking Rock Nature Preserve in Pickens County. The Georgia DNR says the goal of the wildlife viewing program is to create a greater appreciation for animals native to Georgia beyond fishing and hunting. A news release says grant winners will be announced by Feb. 21.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A federal transportation agency has awarded the state a $6.5 million grant to purchase new buses for Kauai and Hawaii Island. Kauai and Hawaii county officials say the Federal Transit Administration announced the grant Friday, but it is unclear when the buses would be fully operational. Hawaii County officials say the money would be used to purchase 10 40-foot buses on the Big Island. Officials say the buses would be used on existing and new routes, including from Hilo to South Kohala and over the Daniel K. Inouye Highway. Kauai County officials say an additional three 30-foot buses and three smaller buses would be purchased for Kauai. U.S. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says investing in new buses ensures residents have an affordable way to get around.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service has agreed to complete environmental reviews of 20 water diversions in central Idaho that a conservation group says could be harming imperiled salmon. A U.S. District Court judge on Thursday signed off on the agreement between the Forest Service and Idaho Conservation League involving the water diversions in the Sawtooth Valley. The conservation group says the Forest Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to complete consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries about the diversions. The Forest Service has three years to complete what are called biological assessments on each of the diversions that mostly supply water to homes in the area. The diversions are on tributaries or the Salmon River, which is home to federally protected salmon, steelhead and bull trout.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A planned one-day strike by some 2,200 nurses at the University of Chicago Medical Center has been called off after their union reached an agreement with the hospital. The Chicago Tribune reports that the agreement between the 618-bed hospital and the nurses who have been without a contract since April was reached Saturday morning. The union had planned to strike Tuesday, and the hospital had said it would lock the nurses out for another four days to guarantee replacement nurses a certain amount of work. That’s what happened in September when a one-day strike by nurses was followed by a four-day lockout. The nurses had been seeking lower nurse-to-patient ratios, but the terms of the agreement were not immediately made available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A foundation is investing up to $50 million to help low-income residents in the capital move up the economic ladder. The Lilly Endowment Inc., based in Indianapolis, says the funding will boost programs and projects aimed at improving residents’ economic footing and move them toward self-sufficiency. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the endowment is soliciting proposals from not-for-profit groups, including human service agencies, neighborhood groups and churches. The Enhancing Opportunity in Indianapolis grants will range from $50,000 to $10 million. Rob Smith, a senior vice president with the endowment, says an average of 180,000 Indianapolis residents experience poverty each year, and many struggle “to meet even their basic needs.”\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: Artist Ray “Bubba” Sorensen II recently finished painting his 87th rock in Albia, Iowa, leaving 12 rocks remaining on his Freedom Rock Tour of the state. During the tour, which Sorensen hopes to wrap up by late next year, he honors veterans by painting military-themed murals on large boulders in each of the state’s 99 counties, the Sioux City Journal reports. He has completed rocks in every Northwest Iowa county. In 1999, Sorensen asked permission to paint a large boulder near Menlo. The 60-ton rock had been a popular spot for graffiti. He painted “Thank you veterans for our freedom” and the flag raising at Iwo Jima. After the rock was eventually graffitied over, a group of veterans asked Sorensen if he would go out and paint the same thing for Memorial Day. Instead, he changed the mural. “It just kind of snowballed from there,” Sorensen says.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: Universities in the state are reducing general education requirements to ensure more students can graduate on time and create more room for classes in their majors. Wichita State University became the latest school to slash the numbers of general ed classes their undergraduates are required to take. Schools are hoping students can learn skills such as ethical reasoning from an engineering course by scrapping philosophy and history requirements in favor of specific goals. But KCUR-AM reports that some liberal arts professors warn the change will remove an essential aspect of what a university education offers – a widespread knowledge of the world. Wichita State’s general education cuts were largely spurred by a Kansas Board of Regents mandate to reduce students’ credit hours.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Outgoing Gov. Matt Bevin has appointed three of his staffers to the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky boards of trustees. Scott Brinkman, the governor’s secretary of the executive cabinet, and Bevin’s state budget director, John Chilton, have been appointed to the University of Louisville’s board of trustees. Brinkman is also a former state legislator from Louisville. Chilton, an accountant, is also from Louisville. Bevin also named Bryan Sunderland, his deputy chief of staff, to the University of Kentucky’s board of trustees. Randall J. Bufford, president of Trilogy Health Services, was also named to the U of L board. Bevin named Sheldon McKinney, executive director of the Kentucky Future Farmers of America Foundation, to the Western Kentucky University board of regents. McKinney lives in Fleming County.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Disney movie “Frozen” inspired an assignment for a Louisiana State University class in modeling the marine atmosphere. The question: If the sea froze while the air temperature was well above freezing, could it bring on wintry weather, as it did in the movie after Princess Elsa runs across the ocean and freezes it? The answer was that, under some circumstances, such a change would be possible. Assistant Professor Paul Miller says he got the assignment idea after watching “Frozen” many, many, many times with his 4-year-old daughter. He set the simulations in 1840s Norway, using climate data from a set going back to 1851 – the earliest available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Taking a cue from Uber and Amazon, two heating oil distributors in the state are stepping up their game by letting consumers order quickly from their phones. The Portland Press Herald reports the first company was Heatable, which is owned by Dead River Co., followed by Order Oil Online. Both distribute in southern Maine. Both Heatable and Order Oil Online are aimed at people who are looking for the lowest prices and quick delivery – not furnace repairs or maintenance. David Simmons, the crew leader of Heatable, says the company serves as a “disruptor” in the marketplace by resetting customer expectations. Kai Nice, president of Order Oil Online, says he plans to drive people to the website primarily with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter campaigns.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Letting a balloon float away would draw a fine of $250 under a bill sponsored by state Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties. The legislation is similar to a Queen Anne’s County law. Lam says he hopes the bill reduces the amount of waste that ends up in the environment and raises awareness of the need to properly dispose of balloons. He says there would be a $250 civil fine for each act of intentionally releasing a balloon, but no one would go to prison for it because it’s not considered a criminal offense. Lam says the state, unlike in Queen Anne’s County, will not allow biodegradable balloons. Because there is not a definite label that states when a balloon will biodegrade, they are still considered damaging and could affect farms, water and wildlife, he says, calling it a bipartisan issue.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nStow: The state is honoring its best and bravest firefighters this week. State Homeland Security Undersecretary Jeanne Benincasa Thorpe and state Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey will recognize heroic acts of bravery at the 30th annual Firefighter of the Year awards at Mechanics Hall in Worcester on Tuesday. Awards to be given out include the Medal of Honor, Medal of Valor, Group Meritorious Conduct, Excellence in Leadership, and the Norman Knight Award for Excellence in Community Service. Firefighters from departments in Andover, Boston, Everett, Fall River, Fitchburg, Lawrence, North Andover, Revere, Rochester, Rockland, Saugus, Sudbury, Westborough and Worcester will be honored during the ceremony. Worcester firefighter Christopher Roy, who died fighting a house fire last year, will be honored posthumously.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials say the state’s drug overdose deaths declined last year for the first time in several years. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services says the state had 2,599 overdose deaths in 2018. That’s a 3.2% drop from 2017’s 2,686 overdose deaths and the first decline in six years. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state agency’s chief medical executive, calls the decline “a step in the right direction” but says much work remains to be done, including addressing disparities in access to drug treatment. Michigan’s opioid-related overdose deaths fell by 0.8% from 2017’s tally to 2,036 such deaths last year. That decline was largely driven by decreases in the number of deaths due to poisoning by heroin and commonly prescribed painkillers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Democrats say the decision by the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives to join a Washington, D.C.-area government relations firm as its director of public affairs is a conflict of interest. The Star Tribune reports that Stateside Associates of Arlington, Virginia, announced the hiring of Rep. Kurt Daudt on Friday. The Republican from Crown will continue to serve in the Legislature and as GOP caucus leader. Minnesota DFL Chairman Ken Martin called on Daudt to resign from one of the roles, arguing that he is “opening himself up to massive conflicts of interest by working for a lobbying firm” while serving in the Legislature. Daudt told the newspaper he will not be lobbying or working on any Minnesota issues in his new job.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Hardy Middle School now has a mural of the late, prominent author Margaret Walker Alexander. WAPT-TV reports the mural was dedicated last week. Alexander was part of an African American literary movement called the Chicago Black Renaissance. While in Chicago, she was part of the Federal Writers’ Project and the Southside Writers Group. She and her family moved to Jackson, where she was a literature professor from 1949 to 1979. She was the director of the Institute for the Study of the History, Life, and Culture of Black People and organized several conferences that were the first of their kind. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at the mural dedication that Alexander used her words to bring beauty and light. She died in 1998.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri has elected an openly gay man as its next leader. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the Rev. Deon Johnson will replace Bishop George Wayne Smith upon Smith’s retirement next spring. The election was held over the weekend at Christ Church Cathedral in downtown St. Louis. Preaching there Sunday, the Rev. Kathie Adams-Shepherd said the Episcopal Church “has not always been a safe space” for all, but a “new season is ahead.” Johnson is rector of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Brighton, near Detroit. He and his husband have two children. He says he has a passion for “social justice and inclusion.” The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri has about 11,500 active members who live in the eastern half of the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Yellowstone National Park officials report significant progress in reducing the number of unwanted lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that the National Park Service says Yellowstone and contract crews culled 282,960 fish this year from the lake. The total is smaller than last year and the year before that, signaling a decline in the overall number of lake trout. That’s good news for Yellowstone cutthroat trout, which suffered a major decline after the detection of the nonnative lake trout 25 years ago. More than 3.1 million fish have been removed in the effort to help bolster native cutthroat trout in the lake. But a panel of experts told the park in May that it would need at least another five years of suppression work.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission is releasing rooster pheasants at 14 wildlife management areas in time for the Thanksgiving weekend. The 14 areas are Powder Creek (Dixon County), Oak Valley (Madison County), Wilkinson (Platte County), George Syas (Nance County), Sherman Reservoir (Sherman County), Pressey (Custer County), Cornhusker (Hall County), Kirkpatrick Basin North (York County), Branched Oak (Lancaster County), Yankee Hill (Lancaster County), Arrowhead (Gage County), Hickory Ridge (Johnson County), Twin Oaks (Johnson County) and Rakes Creek (Cass County). The pheasant season runs through Jan. 31. Permits, including the nonresident two-day hunt permit, may be purchased online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A team of school police motorcycle officers is getting attention not just with tickets but with its posts on social media. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the school zone enforcement unit dubbed the “Fab Five” is racking up traffic stops while providing comedic commentary that might include photos of offending cars (emojis cover license plates), hashtags, memes and humor geared to an extremely online crowd. One recent post included “#JankMachine #MoreSqueaksThanAPetShop.” No one’s spared – not the Review-Journal photographer ticketed for speeding in a school zone on the way to cover the story, and not the school bus driver whose citation prompted the hashtag “#SchoolBusTED.” The crackdown is noticeable. Last school year, the unit cited 3,600 drivers for traffic violations. Just three months into the current year, it’s on pace to about double that number.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Another turkey will live free, not die, after a successful pardon plea at the Statehouse. In his third such request, Gov. Chris Sununu asked the Executive Council on Monday to spare the life of a 2-year-old, 18-pound female turkey named Joanna, noting that while the state abolished the death penalty this year, it doesn’t apply to turkeys. The council’s vote was unanimous, with Councilor Mike Cryans joking that he had no choice given the way the bird was staring at him. Joanna, raised at Birch Rise Farm in Sanborton, will join last year’s pardon recipient, Brooke, at Crotched Mountain School. Two years ago, the lucky pardon recipient was named Hale, after Sarah Josepha Hale, the New Hampshire native known as the mother of Thanksgiving.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy says the state has made a deal to buy a 1,400-acre farm in order to protect endangered species. The Democrat announced the deal Monday. The price the Department of Environmental Protection paid to Atlantic City Electric, which owns the farm, is confidential until the deal closes next month. Known as Holly Farm in Millville, Cumberland County, the property sits between two rivers federally designated as “wild and scenic.” Murphy says the farm has the “largest concentration of endangered species” in the state, and the land will help mitigate climate change. The DEP says a rare plant called the joint-vetch is on the property, along with other threatened and endangered species. The DEP says it doesn’t disclose their locations to protect them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A top official with the state’s court system says bail reforms are working, and the state is moving in the right direction. Artie Pepin, director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, appeared Monday in Santa Fe before a panel of state lawmakers. His testimony comes as critics contend the voter-approved system has allowed for the release of violent and dangerous offenders. Pepin disputed those claims, pointing to a new study by the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research that shows the majority of people released pending trial will show up for subsequent court hearings and aren’t committing new crimes. The researchers reviewed the cases of nearly 6,400 defendants over 21 months. Pepin says the study shows bail reforms are not to blame for Albuquerque’s high crime rates.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester: An intruder didn’t count on an 82-year-old woman living alone being an award-winning bodybuilder with nerves of steel. Willie Murphy tells WHAM she was getting ready for bed Thursday at her home in Rochester when a man pounded on the door and said he needed an ambulance. Murphy called police but wouldn’t open the door. Then the man broke in. She says she clobbered him with a table, poured shampoo in his face and was beating him with a broom when police arrived. The man was sent to a hospital. Police tweeted a selfie with Murphy, calling her “tough as nails.” Murphy works out almost daily at a Rochester gym and says she can deadlift 225 pounds.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Despite bouts of rain that fell in Haywood County over the weekend, the Cold Mountain Fire continues to burn, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Adrianne Rubiaco says. According to National Weather Service meteorologist Doug Outlaw, 1 to 1.5 inches of rain fell Saturday in southern Haywood County, in the vicinity of Cold Mountain. The fire was first detected at 3 a.m. Thursday on the summit of the iconic mountain in the Shining Rock Wilderness area of Pisgah National Forest, according to the Forest Service. As of Monday morning, it was considered 15% contained. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The entire 18,000-acre Shining Rock Wilderness area about 30-35 miles southwest of Asheville, including all 53 miles of hiking trails, remains closed to the public, Rubiaco says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An 18-week-old turkey got an official Thanksgiving pardon from Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday. Lilly was brought to the Capitol by North Dakota Turkey Federation President David Rude. He says the 18-pound turkey was raised on organic feed at his farm near Tolna. As part of the annual tradition, the governor pardoned the bird from being Thanksgiving dinner. The annual event also benefits charity. The Turkey Federation is donating a dozen frozen turkeys each to the Heaven’s Helpers Soup Cafe and the Abused Adult Resource Center, both in Bismarck. North Dakota isn’t a big turkey producer. Nine farms in the state produce about a million birds each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: The Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission says it is now providing free, reliable public Wi-Fi inside all 14 service plazas along the toll road. It says the upgrade replaces an inconsistent patchwork of systems that had been provided by food vendors at those stops along the 241-mile roadway across northern Ohio. Director Ferzan Ahmed says the new system offers seamless Wi-Fi access even at service plazas in more remote areas. The commission says the contract cost nearly $1.9 million, including Wi-Fi and 24-hour customer support for five years, plus equipment, installation and configuration. The project also included network connectivity improvements for turnpike operations, such as toll plazas and maintenance buildings. Agile Network Builders will manage and support the Wi-Fi system.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Health Care Authority has hired a consultant to help devise a state Medicaid program as an alternative to Medicaid expansion. The Oklahoman reports the OHCA finalized a contract last week with Michigan-based Health Management Associates Inc. for up to $1.49 million during the next year to develop a plan. OHCA CEO Kevin Corbett said Gov. Kevin Stitt is looking for an experienced consultant to advise him on alternatives to Medicaid expansion, which Stitt has opposed. Last month, supporters of Medicaid expansion turned in about 313,000 signatures on petitions calling for a statewide vote next year to expand Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma to adults ages 18 to 65 whose income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty level. An estimated 200,000 Oklahomans currently can’t afford health insurance.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: The carcass of a giant blue whale that’s been submerged off the Oregon coast for more than three years is being hauled to the surface so it can be reassembled, studied and put on public display. Oregon State University said Friday that the dead whale washed ashore near Gold Beach in 2015. It’s extremely rare for a blue whale to wash ashore intact, as the creatures can be the length of two school buses. Scientists removed 58 tons of its flesh and then placed the bones in the water off Newport so scavengers could pick them clean. The university says the 365 bones were brought back to land Thursday, including 18-foot-long mandibles and a skull weighing 6,500 pounds. The skeleton’s reassembly will take a year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State lawmakers, judges and top executive branch officials will collect another annual salary increase, with the governor passing $200,000 and rank-and-file lawmakers passing $90,000. Increases for 2020 will be 1.9%, a figure tied by law to the year-over-year regional change in consumer inflation. The boost takes effect Dec. 1 for lawmakers and Jan. 1 for judicial and executive branch officials. Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Saylor is the highest paid, pulling down a $4,000 raise to just above $221,000. Gov. Tom Wolf’s salary will rise about $3,800 to almost $202,000, although he donates it to charity. Both are among the nation’s highest. Most lawmakers, the nation’s third-highest paid, will see increases of $1,725 to about $90,300 in base pay. They also receive per diems, pensions and health benefits. Lawmakers in leadership posts will top out at $141,000.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Christopher Columbus statue has been vandalized for a second time in recent weeks. The statue’s pedestal was splashed overnight with what appeared to be red paint. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office said Monday that city workers had already cleaned it, and police are investigating. The statue was splashed with red paint Oct. 14, when the U.S. holiday named for one of the first Europeans to reach the Americas was being celebrated. A sign that said “stop celebrating genocide” was leaned against the pedestal. It was one of several Columbus statues vandalized nationwide. Elorza said then that he’d consider moving the statue from the city’s Elmwood neighborhood to the largely Italian American Federal Hill neighborhood. The Democrat wants the city to form a committee to review commemorative works, like the Columbus statue.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson: A judge has ruled a school board member couldn’t cancel his resignation by sending another email three days later. Anderson County School District 2 Trustee Stu Shirley sent an email to the board saying he was resigning immediately May 14 after a meeting over whether to buy out the superintendent’s contract. Shirley sent another email three days later saying he rescinded his resignation. But the board split 3-3 on a vote whether to let Shirley back on the board, and a lawsuit was filed. Judge Cordell Maddox ruled against Shirley, saying the board removed his photo, biography and email from its website immediately, showing the intent of the members.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Some tribes in the state are laying the groundwork for residents to begin growing hemp in the next year. The 2018 Farm Bill allows tribes to implement their own hemp programs separate from the state. While Gov. Kristi Noem and the Legislature continue their stalemate over legalizing hemp, tribes have been moving quickly to adopt hemp ordinances, create committees to oversee their hemp programs and submit hemp plans to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. The Flandreau Santee Sioux and Oglala Sioux tribes have already submitted their hemp plans to the USDA. Some tribes, such as the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, are still educating themselves about hemp and haven’t yet formally voted on creating a hemp program.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: More than 40 insurance companies are suing the federal government over its handling of a 2016 wildfire that killed 14 people and destroyed or damaged more than 2,500 buildings in Sevier County. The companies are seeking more than $450 million for claims they paid after high winds swept flames from a wildfire in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into Gatlinburg and its surrounding areas. Five lawsuits filed last week in federal court in Knoxville claim National Park Service officials violated their own policies by letting the blaze burn despite prolonged drought and predicted high winds. It says they also failed to monitor the fire or warn residents of the danger. The park faces a separate lawsuit by victims of the fire.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Central Texas could be on pace for a ninth straight year of record-setting home sales, according to new data from the Austin Board of Realtors. Real estate agents sold 2,721 homes across the region last month, the board said in its latest home sales report. That’s the most for any October on record and a 17% jump over October 2018’s volume, the board said. The latest numbers bolster the chances that the five-county Austin region could end 2019 with sales at an all-time high, said Kevin Scanlan, the board’s president. In addition to October’s home sales tally for the Austin region, several other records were shattered last month. The median home sales price in the region was $327,500, the highest on record for any October and a 7.4% increase over October 2018.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Wildlife officials say the number of reported human encounters with black bears in the state has almost doubled since last year. The Daily Herald reports the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has received 53 reports statewide of incidents involving black bears since Nov. 7, and two involved physical contact with a person. Wildlife officials say there were 27 reports in 2018 and more in 2017. Officials say most of the reported incidents occurred between Salt Lake City and Santaquin, including in northern Zion National Park. Officials say the increased sightings could be due to the increased number of bears in the state over the past decade, but it doesn’t indicate an upward trend. Officials urge campers and canyon residents to secure food and stay informed with safety tips online.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: Local high school students are seeking a patent for an invention they think will help the maple syrup industry. Mynbc5.com reports the invention that measures sap flow was created by technical education students at the Hannaford Career Center in Middlebury. The device measures the flow of maple tree sap moving from trees through plastic tubing to a collection site. The students say it helps to determine if tubing is clogged or frozen. Maple syrup is created by boiling down sap. The Lemelson-MIT program has awarded the team a $10,000 grant to refine the device. The students have met with a manufacturer and with University of Vermont researchers, who their faculty adviser says were encouraging.\n\nVirginia\n\nLorton: A new museum honoring the women’s suffrage movement is set to open early next year. The Lucy Burns Museum is scheduled to open in January to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote. The museum will present the story of 91 years of prison history and the imprisonment of suffragists who were arrested in 1917 for picketing the White House for the women’s right to vote. The Workhouse Arts Center funded, designed and renovated the new museum, restoring a decrepit prison building vacated in 2001. The museum is scheduled to open to the public Jan. 25. A grand opening celebration is scheduled for May 9.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials say it’s safe to eat squid caught in Puget Sound. KOMO-TV reports King County officials recently tested squid from the sound for metals and other contaminants for the first time in two decades. King County officials say the results show it’s safe to eat Puget Sound squid for eight to 12 meals a month. Jenee Colton with the King County Department of Natural Resources says pollution in the sound is contaminating fish. But squid doesn’t have a lot of fat, which means that it doesn’t store a lot of contaminants like other seafood. Dave McBride with the Washington State Department of Health says contaminant levels in squid are low. He says squid is a good choice for consumers and anglers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: Sportsmen’s groups say they are not happy that they could lose about 4,800 acres of hunting land if the New River Gorge National River is designated a national park and preserve. The Register-Herald reports the proposal by U.S. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin would designate about 64,000 acres as a national preserve, with hunting and fishing allowed. The National Park area would consist of a little less than 8,000 acres, with hunting restricted. Some of that land already has hunting restrictions, but more than half does not. West Virginia Wildlife Federation President Jerod Harmon tells the paper the group will not support additional restrictions on hunters, anglers or trappers. The senators say a national park designation will boost tourism.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal report shows that the state’s job growth dropped dramatically in the first half of 2019, although economists say there’s little cause for concern. The U.S. Department of Labor says the state had 2,945,000 nonfarm jobs through June, up 9,340 from the same period last year. That lagged well behind the year-over-year increases for every June since the recession ended a decade ago. From June 2017 to June 2018, Wisconsin added 27,000 jobs. The previous year, the state added 35,000. Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, says job growth has slowed nationally and in many other states. He says a key reason is that unemployment continues to be low, at 3.3% in Wisconsin in October and 3.6% nationally. Winters says many business owners would expand if they had the workforce.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: New rules calling for disciplinary action against Republicans who break from the state party leadership’s views have exposed a rift between state and county GOP leaders. The new rules come after some county party leaders, such as Natrona County GOP Chairman Joe McGinley, criticized the state party’s actions. The Casper Star-Tribune reports members of the party’s state central committee approved the resolutions during a meeting in Lusk last weekend. The committee rejected proposals by Natrona County GOP officials seeking to protect free speech. The resolutions say the First Amendment “does not supersede the conduct and expression within the confines of a private organization.” They also say that violating the party’s principles, bylaws or rules of order “could subject a fellow Republican to a disciplinary committee review or disciplinary action.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/02/28/coronavirus-arizona-updates-virus-travel-safety-more/4903384002/", "title": "LIVE Arizona coronavirus updates: New cases, closures, advisories", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nThe spread of a highly contagious coronavirus has had wide-ranging global impacts, including in the financial markets and government travel policies.\n\nTHE LATEST: This blog has moved.

Trump announced Sunday he would extend social distancing guidelines through April 30.\n\nAmericans abroad urged to come home\n\nMarch 31: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is making his advice to U.S. citizens still overseas during the coronavirus crisis simple: \"Americans who wish to return home from abroad should so immediately and make arrangements to accomplish that,\" he stressed during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nWhile Pompeo said his repatriation task force remains committed to bringing all Americans home, he said the window to do so is closing.\n\n\"We do not know how long the commercial flights in your countries may continue to operate,\" he said as airlines have already slashed international service. \"We can't guarantee the U.S. government's ability to arrange charter flights indefinitely where commercial options no longer exist.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he urged Americans to register with their nearest embassy or consulate or do so online via STEP, the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\n\nAt-home coronavirus tests halted despite progress\n\nMarch 31: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration abruptly shut down sales of at-home coronavirus test kits earlier this month but some companies say they haven’t given up.\n\nThe scarcity of tests in general, coupled with consumers' desire to take control, makes the idea both intriguing and controversial.\n\nCritics say home tests may be unreliable, might delay necessary treatment and could soak up scarce resources. Proponents say at-home test kits could save money and resources – and in the near future could play a critical role in tracking COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA leaped into action on March 20 when several startup companies started selling or preparing to sell at-home kits.\n\nIn strong language, the agency called at-home test kits “fraudulent.”\n\nFeds launch inquiry of 4 lawmakers who sold off stock\n\nMarch 30: Federal authorities are reviewing the stock sales of four lawmakers just before the market slide triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.\n\nFinancial disclosure statements indicated that Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C.; Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; their spouses or advisers sold large chunks of stock around the time lawmakers received behind-the-scenes briefings about the severity of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 2,900 lives in the USA.\n\nThe senators denied any wrongdoing, and Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his transactions involving up to $1.6 million. The federal inquiry, which was in its early stages, was first reported by CNN.\n\nGov. Ducey issues stay-at-home order\n\nMarch 30:Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide \"stay-at-home\" order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, preventing Arizonans from leaving their residences except for food, medicine and other \"essential activities.\"\n\nThe directive, which also allows for outdoor exercise, will take effect at the close of business Tuesday and apply through at least April 30.\n\n\"Already, things have shut down to a large degree,\" the Republican leader said at an afternoon press briefing, with Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ at his side. \"They're going to shut down even further.\"\n\nDucey indicated he did not consider the mandate a \"shelter-in-place\" order, however, saying that phrase is reserved for nuclear attacks or active shooter situations.\n\n\"Our goal here is to protect the lives of those we love most and to ensure the health care system has the capacity to provide them with the care and comfort they deserve,\" he said. \"We want people to stay at home.\"\n\nArizona schools closed for the rest of the school year\n\nMarch 30: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended the closure of all Arizona schools through the end of this school year.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday with Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, Ducey wrote that the decision was made to align with guidance from the federal government.\n\n\"These efforts are crucial, and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures,\" they wrote in the statement.\n\nOn Friday, Ducey signed legislation to allow students to finish the school year from home.\n\nThe plan mandates that schools offer classes in an alternative format, presumably online, so students could finish out the school year from home. It also includes provisions to ensure seniors in high school graduate.\n\nGov. Ducey holds 2 p.m. press conference\n\nSummer Olympics to kick off in July 2021\n\nMarch 30: Less than a week after announcing that the Summer Games in Japan would be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have decided on a new start date of July 23, 2021, according to an International Olympic Committee spokesman. The closing ceremony will be held on Aug. 8. The Tokyo Olympics had previously been set to start almost exactly one year earlier, running from July 24 through Aug. 9.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases now surpass 1K, with 20 deaths\n\nMarch 30: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now number more than 1,000, with 20 known deaths, new numbers posted by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Monday show.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona is 1,157, according to the latest state figures, with every one of the state's 15 counties now recording at least one case.\n\nThat's an increase of confirmed 238 cases, or 26%, since Sunday.\n\nArizona's new coronavirus cases increase to 912; deaths rise to 16\n\nMarch 29: The number of identified new coronavirus cases in Arizona rose to 912 on Sunday — a roughly 17% increase from the day before, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe number of reported deaths related to COVID-19 also increased by one to a total of 16 on Sunday.\n\nMore than 2,000 coronavirus patients have died in U.S.\n\nMarch 28: Just one day after the U.S. surpassed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the nation witnessed another grim figure: More than 2,000 COVID-19 patients have died.\n\nTesting continues to expand across the nation, and the U.S. is seeing daily spikes in the number of reported cases. Nearly 500 coronavirus-related deaths were reported Saturday, up from 1,544 confirmed deaths 24 hours earlier, according to Johns Hopkins University's data dashboard.\n\nThe death toll was 2,010 Saturday shortly after 6 p.m. ET. That number is expected to rise steadily in the coming days and weeks, and health officials say the number of cases is likely higher due to lack of testing. Nearly 18,000 new cases were reported on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nMore than 120,000 cases have been reported in the U.S.\n\nCases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New York has reported the most deaths, followed by Washington, New York and Louisiana, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nFDA authorizes 5-minute coronavirus test the size of a toaster\n\nMarch 28: CHICAGO – A five-minute, point-of-care coronavirus test could be coming to urgent care clinics next week, and experts say it could be \"game-changing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization to Illinois-based medical device maker Abbott Labs on Friday for a coronavirus test that delivers positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, the company said.\n\nThe company expects the tests to be available next week and expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.\n\nDays before closing, Caesars Entertainment said 3,200 workers would lose jobs\n\nLAS VEGAS – Four days before closing nine hotel-casinos along the Las Vegas Strip to slow the spread of COVID-19, Caesars Entertainment notified state officials that 3,200 workers would lose their jobs, according to documents obtained by the Reno-Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn a March 14 letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the company announced the cuts would happen the following day.\n\n\"Given the unknown certainty surrounding COVID-19,\" wrote Servando Lara, Caesars' director of labor relations, \"we are unable to make a determination as to whether the layoff will be temporary or permanent.\"\n\nOne day after the letter arrived, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered that all non-essential businesses across the state shut down to arrest the spread of COVID-19.\n\nArizona COVID-19 deaths up to 15; reported cases rise to 773\n\nMarch 28: Arizona's death toll related to the new coronavirus rose to 15, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday morning.\n\nThe number of reported cases around the state also rose to 773.\n\nAs of Friday, there were 13 deaths and 665 reported cases around the state. Cases grew from Friday to Saturday by roughly 16%.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County announced an additional coronavirus-related death, bringing the county total to five.\n\nThe man was a hospice patient between the age of 18 and 40, the county said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the Pima County death was one of the two additional deaths announced by the state Saturday morning.\n\nMaricopa County reported a growth of 53 cases, with 96 of the 452 cases in the county requiring hospitalization.\n\nMember of Alhambra school community infected\n\nMarch 28: Alhambra Elementary School District announced Friday that someone who attended the school's non-sponsored trip to Magic Mountain has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe news was shared via an email to parents from Richard Stinnett, the school's principal. The email did not reveal whether the infected person was a student or other party.\n\nStinnett relayed in the email that the trip took place from March 6-8, more than two weeks removed since the person in question received their positive test. School has not been in session since the trip, Stinnett wrote.\n\nStill, the email communicated that the infected person is recovering at home while quarantined and that no other cases have been linked to this case.\n\nDisney World, Disneyland to stay closed indefinitely\n\nMarch 27: Citing an \"increasingly complex crisis,\" Disneyland and Disney World are going to stay closed \"until further notice\" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Walt Disney Company said Friday.\n\nThe company's decision dashes hopes that the fabled theme parks would reopen by next month, as had been previously announced. Earlier this week, Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood announced they were extending their closures through April 19.\n\nFor Disney, the concern was about making sure park-goers and employees aren't exposed to the virus.\n\n\"While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains the Walt Disney Company’s top priority,\" the company said in an email statement. It said the decision was \"in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials.\"\n\nTrump signs $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus intended to halt economic meltdown\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package Friday that is intended to address the threat of economic disaster posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump signed the measure – the largest stimulus in U.S. history – in the Oval Office hours after it was approved by the House of Representatives, an unusually rapid approval that underscored dire warnings of a recession as companies began to lay off workers and U.S. consumers hunkered down in their homes to avoid spreading the virus.\n\n\"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said at the signing.\n\nWhile the president’s signature ended the legislative effort on Capitol Hill, it marked a beginning to the government’s work managing the crisis. Now the Trump administration must rapidly pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of direct payments, loans and grants to hard-hit industries such as the airlines.\n\nThe stimulus package will provide $1,200 checks to many Americans – and more for families – while making available hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to maintain payroll through the crisis. It significantly expands the nation’s unemployment safety net and it directs a huge infusion of cash to hospitals and other medical facilities on the front line of fighting the pandemic.\n\nMarkets rallied in recent days on the news that Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal on the stimulus, recovering some of the staggering losses of the past several weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained down Friday in midday trading.\n\nHouse approves historic coronavirus package, sending $2 trillion bill to Trump’s desk\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.\n\nThe House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.\n\nThe vote comes one day after the U.S. reached two grim milestones, becoming the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world and reporting a record 3.28 million workers who applied for unemployment benefits in one week – the highest number in history since the Department of Labor started tracking data in 1967. The massive package aims to offer a financial lifeline to Americans and businesses that are hurting while also offering reassurance to the markets, which have been battered by fears that shutdowns related to the pandemic could throw the economy into a deep recession.\n\nUS neglected its medical stockpile, whistleblowers say\n\nMarch 27: A secretive cache of medical supplies to save Americans from deadly disasters for years lacked the funding to prepare for a pandemic as widespread as the coronavirus, former managers of the stockpile told USA TODAY.\n\nOverseen by a cadre of scientists, disease specialists and others at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Strategic National Stockpile houses roughly $8 billion in inventory for rapid deployment to anywhere in the nation in under 12 hours.\n\nBut its inadequate supply of ventilators, respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment will leave critical shortages for U.S. hospitals scrambling to respond to the mounting coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stockpile had just 16,600 of the breathing machines and an estimated 12 million N95 masks at the start of the pandemic – not enough for the country, USA TODAY reports.\n\nThe latest: US COVID-19 count\n\nUS passes Italy, China as nation with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\nMarch 26: The U.S. surged past China and Italy to become the planet's most infected nation Thursday, a stark milestone in the coronavirus era - and a reminder of its deadly, culture-changing effects on American life.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University dashboard showed the U.S. with 82,404 COVID-19 infections as of 6 p.m., ET, moving past Italy (80,589) and China (81,782). More than 1,100 people have died in the U.S.\n\nPart of the reason for the nation's top ranking is cause and effect: The U.S. has drastically ramped up its testing protocols in order to identify infected people and those who may be carriers of the virus. As testing has increased, so has the number of confirmed cases.\n\nWatch: Trump speaks on coronavirus\n\nMarch 26: On a day when jobless claims smashed a record and U.S. deaths surged past 1,100 as the coronavirus tightened its grip on America, the prospect of a stimulus package soon becoming reality helped propel a third consecutive stock market rally Thursday.\n\nThe Labor Department, in announcing the unemployment claims numbers for last week, said what Americans already knew – that layoffs hit the hospitality and food service industries particularly hard. Other industries that struggled included health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries, Labor said.\n\nCongress was trying to supply a ray of hope. The House is scheduled to take up a Senate-passed, $2 trillion emergency aid proposal Friday. Swift passage was expected – after an initial hangup, the package flew through the Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 96-0. President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to sign the measure.\n\nDow posts best 3-day gain since 1931\n\nMarch 26: U.S. stocks notched their first three-day rally in six weeks Thursday on hopes that Congress will quickly approve a coronavirus rescue package for the economy while the outbreak in China shows signs that it has been largely contained.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1,351.62 points, or 6.4%, to close at 22,552.17. The blue-chip average has advanced 21.3% over the past three days, its biggest three-day gain since 1931. Those gains helped push the Dow back into bull market territory after ending its 11-year historic run this month.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 added 6.2% to finish at 2,630.07. It has gained 17.6% over the past three days, its best percentage gain since 1933.\n\nThe gains came even as data revealed a record number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week after a wave of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases top 500, with 8 known deaths\n\nMarch 26: Confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, topped 500 on Thursday, with eight known deaths, state numbers show.\n\nIdentified cases now total 508 across the state. Maricopa County has just shy of 300 cases.\n\nThe level of community spread, as listed on the state health department’s website, went from moderate to “widespread.” Community spread means the patient had no history of traveling to regions of the world affected by new coronavirus, and also had no known contact with anyone infected by it.\n\nHere's the difference between shelter-in-place and quarantine, and what police can enforce\n\nMarch 26: On March 19, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all 40 million people in the state to shelter in place as health officials battle the new coronavirus. Two days later, Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker ordered his state's 12.7 million residents to also shelter in place.\n\nSince then, millions of people across at least 20 states have been given orders to shelter in place, restricting them from leaving their homes except to go to work if they can't work from home, get food or see a doctor.\n\nBut Arizona, with a population of seven million, isn't one of them.\n\nCongress on track to add $600 per week to jobless checks\n\nMarch 26:The U.S. Senate approved an additional $600 a week in jobless benefits for laid-off workers on Wednesday as the number of people applying for help nationwide hit an all-time weekly record of 3.28 million because of the economic carnage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona also set a new one-day record this week for the number of jobless claims filed.\n\nBenefits currently are capped at $240 a week in Arizona, the second-lowest amount in the nation. The change would increase the figure to $840 per week for people laid off because of the outbreak.\n\nJobless claims surge to 3.3M\n\nMarch 26: Layoffs are skyrocketing as the coronavirus upends the U.S. economy.\n\nThe number of Americans filing initial applications for unemployment benefits jumped nearly twelvefold to a record 3.28 million last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, offering the most vivid evidence yet of the outbreak's widespread damage to the economy.\n\nThe total was well above the 1.5 million claims economists had forecast, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nIllnesses from coronavirus could peak in April with hospitalizations topping out in May, health officials say\n\nMarch 25: Arizona's governor and top health official on Wednesday shared mixed updates on the state's new coronavirus response, reporting a sizable increase in testing but warning of continued medical supply shortages as the virus spreads.\n\nIf infections continue at their current pace, illnesses would peak in April and hospitalizations would peak in May, state Health Director Dr. Cara Christ said at a Wednesday press briefing.\n\n\"Arizona is still in the opening stages of its COVID-19 outbreak, and the number of cases within the state will increase significantly,\" Christ said.\n\nArizona could be short 13,000 beds in treating coronavirus patients\n\nMarch 25: The new coronavirus pandemic could leave Arizona short 13,000 hospital beds for sick patients, a top health official said Wednesday.\n\nThe state's modeling has shown if there's a big wave of illness here — what state officials emphasize is a worst-case scenario — it would hit in mid- to late April, with a high rate of hospitalizations in May, Dr. Cara Christ, the Arizona Department of Health Services director, told reporters during a news briefing with Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\n\"We must continue to increase our bed capacity. With a potential surge of COVID-19 patients, we expect it to be above and beyond our current capacity of beds,\" she said.\n\nSenate passes historic $2 trillion stimulus package\n\nMarch 25: The Senate approved its largest emergency aid package in modern history that will offer $2 trillion to help Americans, hospitals and businesses weather the effects of the coronavirus. The vote late Wednesday night was 96-0.\n\nThe bill will now go to the House for approval before it’s sent to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\nHouse Majority Leader, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced that the House will vote on the $2 trillion bill Friday, and that they will convene at 9 a.m.\n\n\"We expect the bill to pass by voice vote,\" he said.\n\nAmong the provisions offered in the measure are one-time $1,200 checks to individuals, $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses, over $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers and financial help to airlines and other industries hit hard by the virus.\n\nU.S. death toll surges past 1,000\n\nMarch 25: The U.S. death toll was at 1,031 late Wednesday afternoon after eclipsing 600 on Tuesday. Globally, more than 21,000 people have been killed by the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nGov. Ducey to hold press conference at 2 p.m. Wednesday\n\nMost Americans to get $1,200 checks\n\nMarch 25: People earning less than $75,000 per year will get $1,200 checks under the stimulus agreement. Married couples earning less than $150,000 will get $2,400 and children will be worth another $500 each under the deal. The final language is still being crafted, but the package includes $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans to larger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system and $600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.\n\nSenate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said the goal is to ensure that every worker who is laid off or furloughed can pay their bills.\n\n\"And because so many of them will be furloughed rather than fired, if they have benefits, they can continue, and – extremely important – they can stay with the company or small business,\" he said.\n\nIdentified cases in Arizona now top 400, with 6 known deaths\n\nMarch 25: Coronavirus cases in Arizona continue to rise, with 401 identified cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, reported by the state Wednesday.\n\nMohave County reported its first identified case, which means the county will start restricting businesses. Maricopa County reported it now has two cases in people under age 18.\n\nIdentified cases have increased by 23% since Tuesday morning's numbers update from the state. The percentage increase was lower Wednesday than it was on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were at least 326 identified cases and five known deaths reported by the state in its morning numbers update. The state's database now reflects the sixth death, which was announced by Coconino County late Tuesday.\n\nThree known deaths have occurred in Maricopa County, according to county data, as well as one in Pima County and one in Coconino County. It is unclear in which county one of the deaths happened. Coconino County's first known death related to COVID-19 was announced on Tuesday.\n\nNew symptom of COVID-19?\n\nMarch 24: A loss of a sense of smell or taste may be a symptom of COVID-19, medical groups representing ear, nose and throat specialists have warned.\n\nCiting a growing number of cases around the globe, the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery and ENT UK each issued warnings about patients who tested positive for the new coronavirus with the only symptom being a lost or altered sense of smell or taste.\n\n\"Anecdotal evidence is rapidly accumulating from sites around the world that anosmia and dysgeusia are significant symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery wrote in a statement.\n\nAnosmia is the loss of smell while dysgeusia is an altered sense of taste.\n\nTrump sets Easter as possible date to lift restrictions\n\nMarch 24: President Trump said Tuesday that he would like to have the government restrictions on travel and social gatherings eased by Easter, which comes on Sunday, April 12.\n\n“We’re going to be opening relatively soon,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall Tuesday. “I'd love to have it open by Easter ...

The broader S&P 500 index, which professional investors watch more closely, is a single percentage point away from falling into its own bear market, which would end the longest bull market in Wall Street history.\n\nThe decline has been one of the swiftest sell-offs of this magnitude. The fastest the S&P 500 has ever fallen from a record into a bear market was over 55 days in 1987.\n\nWednesday's day’s loss wiped out a 1,167-point gain for the Dow from Tuesday and stan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/25/wildlife-crossing-effigy-mounds-praying-coach-news-around-states/50137711/", "title": "Wildlife crossing, effigy mounds: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Democratic Party has launched a “Free Weed” website to support its effort to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state. The site, www.FreeWeedAL.com, argues that prosecutions for small amounts of cannabis are a waste of criminal justice resources and have disproportionately affected communities of color. The party argued legalizing marijuana could also bring economic benefits to the state. “Alabama’s Republican politicians seem hellbent on wasting money criminalizing ordinary people, ruining lives in the process,” state Rep. Chris England, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, said in a statement. “Criminalizing cannabis doesn’t make us safer.” The site is a mix of policy advocacy and promotion for the state Democratic Party and candidates. It includes statistics about marijuana prosecutions as well as links to donate to the state party, register to vote and volunteer to help candidates. It also offers “Free Weed” T-shirts and other merchandise. Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl called the site “a stunt.” “The Alabama Republican Party supports traditional family values. It’s important to us that our society and our families stay safe, strong, and healthy. The recreational use of marijuana does not encourage these principles,” Wahl said in a statement.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has proposed an expansion of lands available for selection by Alaska Native Vietnam War-era veterans who are entitled to allotments. Tom Heinlein, acting state director for the land agency in Alaska, on Thursday recommended opening about 27 million acres of land for allotment selections by eligible veterans. Currently, about 1.2 million acres are available. Concerns have been raised that some of the currently available lands are difficult to access or outside veterans’ cultural homelands. Heinlein said the next step is to provide detailed land descriptions to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. It would be up to Haaland to sign and issue an opening order for land selections, he said. The plan is to get her that information in the coming weeks, Heinlein said. He called the matter a “super high priority” for Haaland, who visited with veterans last week during her trip to Alaska – her first to the state as secretary. “We have a sacred obligation to America’s veterans,” she said in a statement, adding that she “will not ignore land allotments owed to our Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans.” Under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for up to 160 acres of land. Many Alaska Natives were unaware of this program, which was ultimately expanded and extended.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A developer is exploring the potential for what would be the state’s biggest wind farm on an expanse of high desert in Pinal County about 30 miles north of Tucson. But the company’s plan to erect up to 83 wind turbines at the site known as Oak Wells has already drawn opposition from local ranchers who say the wind farm would harm rangeland as well as the environment and native wildlife. Oak Wells Wind LLC, an Arizona company set up by Boston-based Galehead Development, has been testing the winds with a test station set up in the area since last fall. It has also conducted initial studies on local bird populations and met with state and federal wildlife officials. Galehead has partnered with Steelhead Americas, the North American development arm of Danish wind-turbine maker Vestas, to study the wind resource in a roughly 44,000-acre “area of interest.” No decision has been made on moving forward with the wind project, which if built at a proposed capacity of up to 300 megawatts would be the largest in the state, a manager of the project said. “At this point in time, we are still assessing the viability of a wind farm in the Oak Wells area, but we believe there would be strong interest if it is shown to be a viable area for development,” said Patrick Brown, a project development manager for Vestas.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday that he was considering calling a special session of the Legislature later this year after finance officials said they expected the state’s surplus to hit $1 billion by the end of the year. Hutchinson, a Republican, said he was weighing proposals to use the surplus money to expand broadband access in the state, to address additional school facility funding needs because of inflation and to enact further tax relief. Hutchinson said he did not expect to decide whether to call a special session until mid- to late summer at the earliest, contingent on whether there is consensus behind any proposals. The governor did not elaborate on how much money he was considering for each proposal. The state’s surplus for the fiscal year, which began July 1, is approaching $500 million, state finance officials said earlier this month. Hutchinson said the session might also address the U.S. Supreme Court’s expected ruling on Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. That ruling could overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAgoura Hills: Construction has begun on what is billed as the world’s largest wildlife crossing for mountain lions and other animals caught in Southern California’s urban sprawl. Officials held a ceremony Friday to mark the start of construction of a $90 million bridge over a freeway and feeder road that is about 35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. “This wildlife crossing could not have come at a better time. It is truly a game changer,” said Jeff Sikich, biologist for the National Park Service. “Today’s groundbreaking sets a path toward saving our local mountain lions and supporting the diversity of wildlife in this whole region.” The bridge will stretch 200 feet over U.S. 101 to give big cats, coyotes, deer and other wildlife a safe path to the nearby Santa Monica Mountains. It is expected to be completed by early 2025 and will be named the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing for the philanthropist whose foundation donated $25 million. About 300,000 cars a day travel that stretch of the 101 in Agoura Hills, a small city surrounded by a patchwork of protected wildland that the new crossing will connect. The star of the fundraising campaign to build the bridge was mountain lion P-22, who traveled across freeways and made his home in a huge Los Angeles park. While he is unlikely to use the span because he lives many miles away, P-22 became a symbol of the shrinking genetic diversity of wild animals that must remain all but trapped by sprawling development or risk becoming roadkill.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Investigators believe a wildfire that forced the evacuation of nearly 20,000 people in northern Colorado last month was started by a very small campfire near a hiking trail, authorities said Thursday. However, investigators have exhausted all their leads and have not been able to identify a person responsible for starting the wildfire that broke out March 26 on the outskirts of Boulder, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said. The investigation has been stopped but will be reopened if there are any substantial new leads, it said. The remains of the campfire were found a few feet off a trail on public open space property just inside the city limits of Boulder, south of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the federal facility after which the fire was named, the sheriff’s office said. It is not known how old the campfire was, sheriff’s spokesperson Carrie Haverfield said. The 190-acre wildfire burned to within 1,000 yards of homes on the west end of the college town, near the area where more than 1,000 homes were destroyed by a wildfire pushed by strong winds in late December. The cause of December’s fire is still being investigated by the sheriff’s office.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate on Friday gave final legislative approval to a multiyear labor agreement that includes 2.5% pay raises and bonuses for tens of thousands of state employees, despite concerns raised by some Republicans that taxpayers can’t afford it. The four-year deal, reached by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and recently ratified by 43,000 unionized workers, cleared the Democratic-controlled Senate on a vote of 22-13. The House approved the same agreement Thursday. As in the House, debate in the Senate focused on whether the wage enhancements will help stabilize a predicted tsunami of retirements while rewarding a workforce that endured the pandemic, or instead create future fiscal challenges for the state. Passage of the major labor deal comes as Lamont and the General Assembly are trying to reach an agreement in the final weeks of the legislative session on revisions to the state budget. Meanwhile, as new revenue projections show the state is now poised to end the current fiscal year June 30 with a nearly $4 billion surplus, state lawmakers are limited by caps on spending and revenues. Proponents of the deal contend the bonuses will likely save the state more money in the long run and predict an arbitrator would have probably awarded state employees 3% raises.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A battle is brewing over the health of the Delaware River, waged by the environmental groups sworn to protect it. PennFuture and the Delaware Riverkeeper Network have filed official petitions claiming the Delaware River Basin Commission is holding back on its promise to protect the integrity of the watershed around Wilmington, Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. Studies conducted by the Delaware Riverkeeper Network have concluded that dissolved oxygen levels around these parts of the watershed aren’t high enough to sustain the good health of the river. Mostly these levels are attributed to wastewater treatment plants along the river that pollute it. Jessica O’Neill, a senior attorney at PennFuture, a Harrisburg-based environmental advocacy nonprofit, said the quantity of pollution allowed to be released by these wastewater plants is contingent on the limit set by the River Basin Commission, which she said is dragging its feet on raising the limit. But “raising dissolved oxygen levels in the Delaware Estuary is not as easy as flipping a switch, as some contend,” said Kate Schmidt, communications specialist for the commission. “Besides needing the scientific basis for such an action, as well as a public process, there are significant costs associated with raising the criteria.” Maya van Rossum, leader of the nonprofit Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said the environmental groups pushing back at the commission’s supposed inaction view the panel as working in lockstep with industrial interests.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: At least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, were shot when a gunman unleashed a flurry of bullets in the nation’s capital, leading to lockdowns at several schools Friday. The injured were expected to recover, and the suspect was found dead hours later inside an apartment at the scene as Metropolitan Police Department officers conducted door-to-door searches of buildings in the area. Authorities had said earlier that they were seeking a 23-year-old Virginia man as a person of interest. The man had been “linked to social media postings” that emerged as part of the investigation, said Assistant Metropolitan Police Chief Stuart Emerman. Police believe the man erected a “sniper-type setup” with a tripod and rifle in his apartment and began firing indiscriminately at people walking below, Chief Robert Contee said. The shooting was recorded and posted online on 4chan, an online message board. Separately on Friday, emergency medical crews were called to the Supreme Court about 6:30 p.m. after a man set himself on fire outside the building. Police said Saturday that the man, Wynn Bruce, 50, of Boulder, Colorado, had died.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A rehabilitated green sea turtle was released back to the ocean in the Florida Keys on Friday to mark Earth Day. Several hundred onlookers watched on Marathon’s Sombrero Beach as staff from the Keys-based Turtle Hospital released “TJ Sharp,” a 65-pound juvenile sea turtle rescued in February. The endangered reptile had been discovered floating offshore, unable to dive and visibly affected by fibropapillomatosis, a condition that causes cauliflower-like tumors and affects sea turtles around the world. TJ’s condition upon arrival at the Turtle Hospital required surgical removal of the tumors and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, vitamins, and a nourishing diet of greens and mixed seafood. “Sea turtles are the oldest animal known to man – to be able to take a sea turtle, rehabilitate it and return it to its ocean home on Earth Day, it’s just an amazing day,” Turtle Hospital manager Bette Zirkelbach said. She said that although Earth Day is recognized once a year, humans can take daily steps to protect marine resources and help ensure the survival of sea turtles. “What people need to do to make every day Earth Day is to reduce single-use plastics, keep trash out of our oceans and help keep our planet clean,” Zirkelbach said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was hostile during testimony Friday in a hearing on her eligibility to run for reelection, saying she did not remember liking and making various social media posts surrounding the attack on the U.S. Capitol last year and accusing an opposing lawyer of using chopped videos and twisting her words. Voters in the Georgia congresswoman’s district have said Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection that disrupted certification of President Joe Biden’s victory, making her ineligible for reelection under a rarely cited section of the 14th Amendment dealing with “insurrection or rebellion.” But Greene – who, the day before the Capitol riot, proclaimed on TV that this is “our 1776 moment” – testified that she’s never endorsed violence. Greene is set to appear on the Republican ballot for Georgia’s May 24 primary and has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump. The administrative law judge who oversaw the hearing must present his findings to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who will then make the ultimate determination over whether Greene is qualified. Greene has repeatedly denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection and has filed a lawsuit alleging that the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is itself unconstitutional.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. government on Friday dropped its appeals of a state order requiring it to remove fuel from a massive military fuel storage facility that leaked petroleum into the Navy’s water system at Pearl Harbor last year. Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Defense notified the state and federal courts of its decision. The move comes more than a month after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the military would permanently shut down the tanks and drain all of their fuel. The Hawaii Department of Health, which issued the order, said the decision regarding the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility was a “step forward.” “While today’s announcement is good news, the work continues,” the department said in a statement. It said it would “continue to act expeditiously and proactively to oversee the safe defueling and decommissioning of Red Hill and restoration of the aquifer.” David Henkin, an attorney for Earthjustice which is representing the Sierra Club of Hawaii as an interested party in the case said his clients would remain vigilant to make sure the tanks are promptly defueled. “It’s a wonderful Earth Day gift to the people of Hawaii and in particular to all the residents of Oahu who depend on safe, clean drinking water when they turn on their tap,” Henkin said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense plans to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory. The department signed off on the Project Pele plan to build the reactor and reactor fuel outside of Idaho and then assemble and operate the reactor at the lab. The decision follows a two-volume, 600-page environmental impact statement that includes public comments evaluating alternatives for building and operating a gas-cooled microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. “Advanced nuclear power has the potential to be a strategic game changer for the United States, both for the (Department of Defense) and for the commercial sector,” said Jeff Waksman, program manager for Project Pele. “For it to be adopted, it must first be successfully demonstrated under real-world operating conditions.” Officials had previously said preparing testing sites at the Idaho National Lab and then building and testing the microreactor would take about three years. The department said the project is subject to the availability of appropriations. The department said two reactor designs are being considered, and one chosen will be announced later. The department said both designs are high-temperature gas-cooled reactors using enriched uranium for fuel.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A judge on Friday threw out 44 more convictions tied to a notorious former police sergeant who regularly framed people for drug crimes they didn’t commit, exonerations that victim advocates said would be among the last from one of the most disgraceful chapters in the Chicago Police Department’s history. The dismissal of the cases by Cook County Judge Erica Reddick was the result of petitions to do so filed by the victims’ attorneys with the support of the Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s office. “In order to restore trust in the criminal justice system, as prosecutors, we must approach every case with an eye toward the facts, the evidence, and the law,” Foxx said in a press release. The latest dismissals bring to more than 170 Black defendants who have seen their drug convictions tied to former Sgt. Ronald Watts and his tactical unit dismissed in recent years. Joshua Tepfer, an attorney with The Exoneration Project who has worked with many people convicted due to Watts and his crew, said that Friday’s hearing would be the last of a number of similar hearings in recent years in which large numbers of victims have had their convictions thrown out. He said only a few cases remain.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A report from the Domestic Violence Network analyzing crisis calls to service providers in central Indiana shows calls to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department nearly doubled during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report recorded 2020 data from service providers across central Indiana, which includes Marion, Hamilton, Hendricks, Hancock, Boone, Johnson, Madison, Morgan, Monroe and Shelby counties. In 2020, there were approximately 13,500 calls made to five area agencies: the Julian Center, Sheltering Wings, Alternatives, Inc., Families First, Prevail and Beacon of Hope. (Families First has since merged with Children’s Bureau; the agency is now known as Firefly Children & Family Alliance.) Kelly McBride, executive director of Domestic Violence Network, said the pandemic did not cause domestic violence in central Indiana, but the effects of the stay-at-home orders exacerbated problems that had already been there. The report specifies that correlation does not equal causation in regard to COVID-19 and that COVID-19’s effect on domestic violence will be studied for years to come. COVID-19 stay-at-home orders put abusers and families into enclosed situations at home and also cited the stressors of people losing their jobs and increased alcohol use during the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A check of the state’s online court system shows a unique name for the prosecutor in hundreds of cases: the Easter Bunny. The Iowa Capital Dispatch reports that on April 4, online docket sheets for hundreds of Polk County cases were revised to indicate the prosecution had been transferred from an assistant county attorney to “Easter Santa Bunny.” Bret Lucas, an assistant county attorney, said the situation stems from a recent realignment of cases within the county attorney’s office. Some cases were “transferred” to the Easter Bunny until all the work on the digital case transfer could be finished. Lucas said it appears that the Judicial Branch and the IT department decided to use the fake placeholder name. Stacy Curtis, a supervisor for the criminal division of the Polk County Clerk of Court’s Office, said the references to the Easter Bunny should not have been visible to the public.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Housing developers will now be able to get state help for home projects related to economic development, the governor’s office announced Thursday. The Startup Housing Opportunity Venture Loan program is intended to help build houses to address the needs of communities across Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly said. “A shortage of quality, affordable housing is a barrier to economic growth and development throughout the state – and particularly in rural Kansas,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Affordable housing is a vital component of recruiting and retaining workers, families, and entrepreneurs to help rural and urban Kansas thrive. We can’t capitalize on our record-breaking economic success if we don’t have affordable housing options for our workforce, and I’m pleased this new program will be another step in addressing this challenge.” The SHOVL program will provide funding to housing developers for expenses incurred before the closing of permanent financing for housing developments. No-interest loans of up to $25,000, with a required 20% match, available to private developers, nonprofit organizations and local governments looking to construct housing developments in communities with populations of fewer than 10,000 people.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is seeking volunteers for its first Park Care Day. The volunteer day is being held Saturday at the Lincoln boyhood home site at Knob Creek, the park said in a statement. There will be a variety of projects for volunteers to tackle, including planting an interpretive garden at Knob Creek. Park staff researched to find heirloom variety seeds close to what the Lincoln family might have grown while living at the Knob Creek Farm, the statement said. Volunteers will plant seeds that include Bloody Butcher Corn, Scarlet Pole Runner Beans and Connecticut Field Pumpkins. Those interested in participating are encouraged to register by calling the Birthplace Visitor Center.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A 4-year-old girl is dead after her grandmother allegedly forced her to drink a bottle of whiskey while her mother watched, according to police. Sgt. L’Jean McKneely, a Baton Rouge police spokesperson, told news outlets the little girl’s grandmother, Roxanne Record, 53, and mother, Kadjah Record, 29, were arrested Friday, each on a charge of first-degree murder. It was unknown if either of them had an attorney who could speak on their behalf. Officers were sent to a Baton Rouge home about 11 a.m. Thursday after reports of an unresponsive child. The child, 4-year-old China Record, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office said an autopsy showed a cause of death was acute alcohol poisoning. The little girl had a blood-alcohol level of 0.680%, more than eight times the 0.08% driving limit for an adult, authorities said. While investigating, detectives say they learned the victim’s grandmother forced her to drink a bottle of the alcohol while the mother watched. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state has created a website – maine.gov/reliefchecks – to help residents collect their $850 relief checks included in a $1.2 billion supplemental budget signed by the governor last week. The website aims to answer commonly asked questions surrounding eligibility, timing of checks and filing taxes. “We want to make sure that every eligible person is able to receive this assistance, and we are hopeful that this website can help accomplish that by answering some of the most common questions Maine people may have,” Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement. The money accounts for more than half of the $1.2 billion budget. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. The checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 individuals, but filing an income tax return is a prerequisite. The state is giving late-filers until Oct. 31 to submit their tax returns. Income limits for the payments are $100,000 for an individual or married filing separately; up to $150,000 for head of household; and $200,000 for couples filing jointly. The first round of checks will go out in June, and additional checks will roll out through the end of the year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An area teen who created a COVID-19 kit for teachers has been recognized as one of 25 Prudential Emerging Visionaries from around the country. Arthur Wang, 17, realized the severity of the disease months before most of his classmates when he got updates about the coronavirus from his uncle, who is a doctor in China. That inspired the Columbia resident to come up with an effort to better support teachers and other workers in Howard County, where he is a junior at River Hill High School, and beyond. “We wanted to help the community,” he said. “I realized how hard it was for the teachers to switch from virtual to in-person classes. Some teachers said it was like flying a plane with no direction.” Wang inspired 42 other students in the county to form the nonprofit Clarksville Youth Care Group. The organization has donated more than 1,400 protective kits to teachers at 62 schools. And he’s not done yet. The kits include a handmade colorful cloth mask in assorted designs that features a pocket where a filter can be inserted for additional protection; an “ear saver,” which reduces the strain that masks place on the ears; a thank-you card; and a mask lanyard. Each kit takes about three hours to make. Wang, who previously raised $13,000 in an effort to make 3,600 face shields that were donated to 101 hospitals, clinics, dental offices, urgent care centers and first responders in seven states, raised $5,000 for the project focused on educators.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The mayor released a plan, on Earth Day, to address extreme heat caused by climate change in disadvantaged city neighborhoods. The Heat Resilience Solutions for Boston plan presents a number of strategies that Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu says will help build a “more just, equitable, and resilient Boston.” The plan focuses on five so-called environmental justice communities that experience greater burdens as temperatures rise: Chinatown, Dorchester, East Boston, Mattapan, and Roxbury. It also includes citywide strategies that Wu said her administration will pursue, such as distributing “pop-up cooling kits” that include a hose, misters and a tent to community organizations that have public events this summer. Wu said her administration will also launch a design challenge for heat resilient “cool” bus stops and educate property owners on the benefits of installing so-called cool roofs that increase energy efficiency. And a new Boston Extreme Temperatures Response Task Force will help coordinate the city’s efforts as it’s faced more hot days and nights over the past decade than any decade in the previous 50 years, Wu said. The heat plan is a part of Climate Ready Boston, ongoing efforts to prepare for sea level rise, coastal storms, extreme precipitation, extreme heat and other impacts.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The Rev. Al Sharpton demanded Friday that authorities publicly identify the officer who killed Patrick Lyoya, a Black man and native of Congo who was fatally shot in the back of the head after a struggle. Sharpton’s comments at Lyoya’s funeral renewed demands by Lyoya’s family members and activists. He told the roughly 1,000 people gathered that authorities cannot set a precedent of withholding the names of officers who kill people. Police in Grand Rapids have said they will withhold the officer’s name unless he is charged with a crime, which they describe as a long-standing practice that applies to the public as well as city employees. “Every time a young Black man or woman is arrested in this town, you put their name all over the news. Every time we’re suspected of something, you put our name out there,” Sharpton said. “How dare you hold the name of a man that killed this man? We want his name!” Mourners at Renaissance Church of God in Christ, many wearing T-shirts or sweatshirts bearing Lyoya’s picture, stood and applauded. In a statement Friday, City Manager Mark Washington acknowledged the demands and said he would discuss the matter with the police chief and human resources officials.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A 13-year-old boy will soon earn his bachelor’s degree from college, with a major in physics and a minor in math. Elliott Tanner is maintaining a 3.78 grade point average at the University of Minnesota and participating in undergraduate research while also tutoring classmates. He wants to be a high-energy theoretical physicist and ultimately a professor of physics at the university. “I have an incredible passion for physics,” he said. “It’s been one of my favorite things to do.” Elliott’s mom, Michelle Tanner, said he started reading and doing math by age 3. Following a few years of home schooling and a high school curriculum that took him two years to complete, he began taking college classes when he was 9. “People who hear Elliott’s story say he doesn’t get to be a kid, or he grew up too fast,” Michelle said. “He still very much is a kid, and the only difference is he goes to school in a different building.” Besides being on the verge of graduating, he has been accepted into the University of Minnesota’s Physics PhD program. Now his parents are trying to figure out how to pay for it. “We’re just trying to explore all our options and coming up with dead ends,” Michelle said. “Trying to apply for any scholarships, fellowships, grants, and we have not been successful.”\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: Stymied in their calls for a renewed investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, relatives and activists are advocating another possible path toward accountability: They want authorities to launch a kidnapping prosecution against the woman who set off the lynching by accusing the Black Chicago teen of improper advances in 1955. Carolyn Bryant Donham was named nearly 67 years ago in a warrant that accused her in Till’s abduction in Mississippi – even before his mangled body was found in a river, FBI records show – yet she was never arrested or brought to trial in a case that shocked the world for its brutality. Authorities at the time said the woman had two young children, and they did not want to bother her. Donham’s then-husband and another man were acquitted of murder. Relatives of Till still prefer a murder prosecution, but there is no evidence the kidnapping warrant was ever dismissed, so it could be used to arrest Donham and finally get her before a criminal court, said Jaribu Hill, an attorney working with the Till family. “This warrant is a stepping stone toward that,” she said. “Because warrants do not expire, we want to see that warrant served on her.” There are plenty of roadblocks. Witnesses have died in the decades since Till was lynched, and it’s unclear what happened to evidence collected by investigators.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The city has agreed to reinstall two paving stones that contained a reference to a Confederate general to settle a lawsuit filed after the stones were removed, according to attorneys in the case. Edith Vogel, a former City Council member, sued the city and Mayor Carrie Tergin in March after the pavers were removed. Vogel paid for the stones to be installed at a park on a city greenway known as Adrian’s Island as part of a fundraising campaign. Vogel’s attorneys at Bradbury Law Firm said a federal judge approved a settlement Thursday, KOMU reports. Under the settlement, the city agreed to reinstall the pavers within 15 days and pay Vogel’s attorney’s fees. Vogel contended in her lawsuit that her free speech rights were violated when the stones were removed. The stones read: “Union Camp Lillie notes: deciding against attack the confederate army under Gen. Sterling Price turned from Jefferson City Oct. 7, 1864.” The City Council voted in October 2021 to remove a similar paving stone from a roadway. Although she is not required to do so, Vogel said she will donate to the Parks Foundation $2,000, which was the amount the city refunded to her when it removed the pavers.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The administrator of the state psychiatric hospital is leaving his post amid the facility’s loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding for repeated failures to meet health and safety standards, the state health department said Thursday. Kyle Fouts, who has led the Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs since 2019, will begin work May 9 as administrator at the Intensive Behavior Center in Boulder, Colorado, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The center is a 12-bed, short-term treatment facility for people with intellectual disabilities. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had found patients at the Montana State Hospital were in “immediate jeopardy” several times in recent months before revoking the hospital’s federal funding effective April 12. Payments for patients who were already at the hospital continues for another 30 days, but no new patients would qualify for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements. The hospital’s deficiencies included failing to separate patients with COVID-19 from those who weren’t sick. Three patients died of COVID-19. Another patient died after repeated falls. The hospital, which had about 142 patients in early April, is also short-staffed and has relied heavily on traveling staff, the agency found.\n\nNebraska\n\nCambridge: Wind-driven wildfires sweeping through parts of Nebraska contributed to the death of one person and injured at least three firefighters, authorities said Sunday. The person who died was in Red Willow County, in the southwest corner of the state, Nebraska Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Jodie Fawl said. Fawl said she didn’t have details about that person or where the firefighters were injured, though she said their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Blazes have been reported in 12 counties around the state since Friday. The state agency said they were still burning Saturday night in five counties in Nebraska’s southwest: Perkins, Hayes, Furnas, Red Willow and Frontier counties. The agency didn’t provide estimates of the total area that had been burned or the number of homes or other structures that had been destroyed. Several small towns, including Cambridge, Bartley, Indianola and Wilsonville, in Nebraska’s southwest and Macy in its northeast, were forced to temporarily evacuate because of the fires. The evacuation orders were lifted Saturday. The Nebraska National Guard deployed three helicopters and several support trucks to help battle the blazes.\n\nNevada\n\nCrystal Bay: For nearly eight decades, the Tahoe Biltmore has been a familiar fixture for motorists rounding the curved stretch of pavement on Nevada State Route 28 that led to the property. Come 5 a.m. Saturday, the long-standing hotel-casino will close its doors one final time. “It’s been 76 years,” said Janet Fogerson, controller for the property. “I mean, the Rat Pack used to go across the street.” But not even Frank Sinatra and his crew can win against Father Time. The same can be said about the Tahoe Biltmore, whose old-school charm will soon yield to a more modern resort and residential project known as Boulder Bay. Chalk it up to the steady march of growth and progress, something from which even idyllic Lake Tahoe is not immune. “I have been up here for 42 years, so I have seen a lot of growth, and I have seen a lot of changes,” Fogerson said. “But when that building comes down, it’s going to be emotional.” The Tahoe Biltmore first opened in 1946. The crew celebrated one last hurrah by holding a goodbye party for the property this past Saturday, with cash drawings, free food and live entertainment.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill adding an exception to the state’s new abortion ban for cases in which the fetus has been diagnosed with “abnormalities incompatible with life” has been sent to the desk of Gov. Chris Sununu, who said he would sign it. Since Jan. 1, New Hampshire has outlawed abortion after 24 weeks’ gestation, with exceptions only for pregnancies that threaten the mother’s life or health. Doctors who provide late-term abortions can face felony charges, and ultrasounds are required before any abortion. With nine Republicans joining all 10 Democrats, the state Senate voted 19-5 in favor of a bill to limit the use of ultrasounds and add the “abnormalities incompatible with life” exception. The bill passed the House last month. Sen. Becky Whitley, D-Hopkinton, said she was grateful to women who shared heartbreaking stories, including a Brookline woman who learned 21 weeks into her pregnancy that one of her twins would not survive on her own after birth. “We know that there are many more women who have these deeply personal stories who may not be comfortable attending a public hearing who can attest that, yes, these circumstances are rare, but they happen to real families,” she said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCamden: Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes allegedly froze out and retaliated against a media specialist in her office who twice refused to process compact discs that contained inappropriate pictures of her and her husband, according to a lawsuit filed last Monday in state Superior Court. The specialist, Henry Hernandez, of Clifton, claims in his suit that the retaliation worsened during the COVID-19 crisis. His bosses disregarded his medical issues, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart problems, and refused to install plastic desk barriers in his unit, the lawsuit said. They also unjustly docked his pay, isolated him by banning visitors to his office and ignored his concerns about being reinfected with the virus after he recovered from the illness in December 2021, according to court papers. In the five-count suit, Hernandez accused Valdes and Christopher Drelich, the county’s chief of investigators and his superior’s boss, of intending to cause him severe emotional distress. He also claimed they violated the state’s Conscientious Employee Protection Act and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. Hernandez wants a judge to levy punitive damages, interest costs, attorneys’ fees and any other relief, the suit said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Federal authorities are taking to the airwaves to call attention to unsolved homicide and missing person cases on the largest Native American reservation in the U.S. The FBI announced last week that it’s running a 60-second radio ad in the Navajo language to call attention to what family members and advocacy groups have described as a crisis that is affecting Indian Country. Airing twice a day on an AM radio station broadcasting from the Navajo capital of Window Rock, Arizona, the spot features a plea from the mother of Lee Michael Pahe, who was found fatally shot last summer in Naschitti, New Mexico. “You don’t have to understand Navajo to feel the emotion of the mother who speaks about the loss of her son in this ad,” Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda of the Albuquerque FBI Division said in a statement. “Violent crime affects everyone the same way, and everyone deserves justice.” The radio spot comes as New Mexico implements legislation adopted earlier this year to ensure more effective coordination among law enforcement agencies when it comes to missing Native Americans or unsolved homicides. State Attorney General Hector Balderas has met with victims regarding obstacles to reporting, investigation and other issues that they have experienced.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could allow for the automatic sealing of some criminal records, make it harder to evict tenants, and ban gas and oil hookups in new buildings under bills that advocacy groups want lawmakers to pass in this year’s legislative session. The Democratic-led Legislature passed a $220 billion budget this month that boosted pay for health care and home care workers, shaved 16 cents off the cost of a gallon of gas through December, and tweaked a landmark bail law. But the budget excluded several criminal justice and environmental policy proposals that had received support from Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state Senate. State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he opposed using the budget to pass new policies. Lawmakers could also pass a bill that could nix former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin, a Democrat, from the June primary ballot. Benjamin resigned April 12 in the wake of his arrest in a federal corruption investigation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A smarter-than-average bear took a tourist jaunt through downtown – even taking care to use crosswalks at intersections – before police guided it back to nature. Asheville police said the call they received Thursday about a bear milling through downtown was the third such call they’d received in a three-week span. Video posted by the police department on its Facebook page Friday shows the bear waiting at a crosswalk and looking both ways before crossing the intersection. In another clip he climbs a tree in a small park space. Officers guided the bear, which was wearing a tracking collar, back into a wooded area.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to change the state constitution to require voter approval of constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60% and limit a measure to a single subject is a step closer to bringing the matter to a public vote. Secretary of State Al Jaeger on Friday said the sponsoring committee delivered 910 petitions with a claimed 33,624 signatures, just over the 31,000 signatures that must be approved to get the proposed measure on the November ballot. Jaeger approved the petitions for circulation a year ago. His office has 30 days to determine if the measure qualifies for the ballot. The citizen-led Protect North Dakota’s Constitution believes the voter threshold for amending the state constitution isn’t high enough. The group said a dozen constitutional amendments proposed since 2010 have been successful. Backers say the measures also often have contained multiple issues. Citizen initiatives allow residents to bypass lawmakers and get proposed state laws and constitutional amendments on ballots if they gather enough signatures from voters.\n\nOhio\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base: A high-ranking Air Force official has been convicted by a military judge of one of three specifications of abusive sexual contact in the first-ever military trial of an Air Force general. The charge faced by Maj. Gen. William Cooley during the weeklong court-martial at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base had three specifications, one alleging a forcible kiss and two alleging forcible touching in 2018. Cooley was convicted Saturday of the forcible kissing specification but acquitted of the other two. Officials said the verdict marks the first court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the Air Force’s 75-year history. A former commander of Air Force Research Laboratory, Cooley was charged with abusive sexual contact in an encounter with a woman who gave him a ride after a backyard barbecue in New Mexico nearly four years ago. Officials said the woman is a civilian who is not a Department of Defense employee. Cooley is set to be sentenced Monday morning and could face as much as seven years in jail as well as loss of rank, pay and benefits. Cooley had the option of a trial by court member jurors or by military judge, and he chose to have the case heard by the judge.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Enoch Kelly Haney – a Native American artist, Seminole Nation chief and state lawmaker – has died at age 81. Haney’s death was announced Saturday by Brian Palmer, assistant chief of the Seminole Nation. A cause of death was not immediately released. “With a heavy heart, the Seminole Nation woke to the news of the passing of Chief Kelly Haney. An inspiration to many, an accomplished artist, his work with the State and later as Chief highlighted his career, but his greatest achievement is that of family. Keep his family in prayer and may they find comfort in knowing the Seminole Nation and Indian Country mourns his loss,” Palmer said in a statement on Facebook. In a tweet Saturday, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said Haney’s “contributions to our state are mighty.” Haney, who had most recently lived in Norman, grew up in Seminole. His grandfather was the chief of the Seminole Tribe in the 1940s. A Democrat, Haney was a Methodist minister prior to entering politics in 1978 as co-chair of then-Lt. Gov. George Nigh’s first of four successful campaigns for governor. Haney’s 17-foot sculpture “The Guardian,” a towering statue of a Native American, was placed atop the state Capitol dome in 2002.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The growth of the state’s wolf population slowed significantly last year because 21 animals were poisoned by poachers, hit by cars, or killed by wildlife officials after they attacked livestock, state wildlife authorities said Wednesday. The 2021 census counted 175 wolves, up just two animals from the previous year, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said. The number of documented packs decreased to 21 from 22 after eight wolves in eastern Oregon were illegally poisoned, wiping out an entire pack. The number of breeding pairs of wolves was down to 16, from 17 in 2020. It was the slowest rate of wolf growth since 2016, although agency officials did add that wolves expanded their range into four new areas of activity in rural areas in Jefferson, Klamath, Grant and Union counties. The count only captures wolves observed through visual observations, tracks and remote camera photographs, and the actual number of wolves in Oregon is higher, officials stressed. Just 13% of the wolves in Oregon are in the western part of the state. Conservation group Cascadia Wildlands said the high number of wolf deaths at the hands of humans was unacceptable. “Oregon’s wolf population simply cannot sustain such high levels of human-caused wolf mortality,” said Nick Cady, Cascadia Wildlands’ legal director. “The state needs to both seriously prosecute poachers and stop killing wolves to subsidize commercial livestock operations.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city abandoned its indoor mask mandate Friday, just days after becoming the first U.S. metropolis to reimpose compulsory masking in response to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. City officials who had previously stressed the need to head off a new wave of coronavirus infections by requiring people to mask up indoors abruptly called it off after what they said was an unexpected drop in the number of people in the hospital and a leveling-off of new infections. The city had taken plenty of heat for the renewed masking order, with a lawsuit already filed and two of the three leading Democratic candidates for Pennsylvania’s open U.S. Senate seat expressing opposition to it at a debate Thursday night. But city officials insisted Friday that their decision was about the data, not any external legal or political pressure. “I had said when I announced this that if we didn’t see hospitalizations rising that we needed to rethink this and that we shouldn’t have a mandate. So that’s what we’re doing today,” the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Cheryl Bettigole, said at a virtual news conference Friday. Still, the city’s on-again, off-again decision-making left some people scratching their heads, with restaurant manager Jesse Andreozzi saying officials were “flip-floppy” when it came to masks.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s taxpayers own a desirable piece of property right by the ocean in Narragansett – they just can’t use it. For close to a decade, the city’s summer camp at the southern tip of Point Judith has been boarded up and closed to the public. And although Providence is now awash in $166 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds, the city currently has no plans to use any of that money to reopen it, according to a spokesman for Mayor Jorge Elorza. Public records show Providence is currently paying $13,061 a year in taxes to the Town of Narragansett for the property, which is valued at $1,092,100. “I would love to see the property rehabbed so that the residents of Providence can go back to enjoying day trips there,” said City Councilman Michael Correia, who pushed for years to reopen the seaside camp. “I do have to admit that it has fallen off the radar since the pandemic hit.” The property is typically referred to as “Camp Cronin” – a frequent source of confusion, since it abuts the much larger Camp Cronin Fishing Area, which is state-owned and open to the public. Providence once owned both parts of Camp Cronin, purchased from the federal government after World War II. It served as a summer camp that got inner-city children out of their sweltering neighborhoods, regardless of parents’ ability to pay. Over the years, the city also routinely bused nursing home residents and other older people to Camp Cronin so they could take in the fresh air, enjoy a cookout and play bingo.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Supporters of a bill to allow women to get birth control pills at pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription are trying to get it passed before this year’s session ends. A state House subcommittee on Wednesday approved the bill, sending it to the chamber’s full medical committee. The bill has already passed the Senate, but there are just nine regular legislative days left in the General Assembly’s 2022 session. Pharmacists could choose whether to participate in the program, which allows them to give birth control pills or other hormonal contraceptives to women over 18 without a doctor’s visit, The Post and Courier reports. Even in areas without doctors, there are pharmacies close by, state Rep. Russell Ott told the newspaper. “If we want to get serious about cutting down on abortions, if we’re going to decrease the number of unwanted or unplanned pregnancies, we need to get real,” said Ott, D-St. Matthews. The bill unanimously passed the Senate last year. Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, introduced it after the General Assembly passed a bill greatly restricting abortions, saying it was another logical step to stopping unwanted pregnancies. The only GOP member of the House subcommittee voted against the bill. Rep. Joe Bustos, R-Mount Pleasant, said a doctor should be involved “anytime you’re putting chemicals into your body.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A newly formed organization wants to put a question on the November ballot that would forbid the construction or operation of any new slaughterhouses within city limits. It’s a ballot question aimed squarely at Wholestone Farms, a Nebraska-based pork processor that announced plans last year to build a $500 million plant in northeastern Sioux Falls. The executive director of Citizens for a Sustainable Sioux Falls called the project “a step backwards” for the quality of life in Sioux Falls that was going to “slide in under the radar,” listing concerns including odor, water quality and affordable housing. Wholestone’s board chair, on the other hand, said the company is an open book and going above and beyond to be a good neighbor, while questioning who exactly is funding the opposition to the plant. Citizens for a Sustainable Sioux Falls has been pushing back against the plant since at least March 11, when it sent out a press release entitled “New Survey: Sioux Falls Residents Raise Alarm on Mega-Slaughterhouse.” The group is headed by Robert Peterson, who has worked as a field director for Marty Jackley’s gubernatorial campaign and as a public policy and outreach manager at the South Dakota Treasurer’s Office.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Prosecutors will no longer pursue illegal voter registration charges against a woman who was granted a new trial after she challenged her jury conviction, a district attorney said Friday. Charges against Black Lives Matter activist Pamela Moses, 44, are being dismissed, and she will no longer face a second trial “in the interest of judicial economy,” Shelby County district attorney Amy Weirich said in a statement. Moses, who had prior felonies, was convicted in November of registering to vote illegally in Memphis in 2019 and was sentenced Jan. 31 to six years and one day in prison. She has said she was unaware she was ineligible to vote. At the time, legal experts said her sentence was excessive. Moses filed a motion asking for a new trial. In February, Criminal Court Judge Mark Ward overturned her conviction and granted Moses a second trial, which now won’t take place. In all, Moses has spent 82 days in custody on the case, “which is sufficient,” Weirich said in her statement. Moses’ previous felony convictions permanently barred her from voting. In 2015, she pleaded guilty to two felonies as well as three misdemeanors and was placed on probation for seven years. Moses said the Tennessee Department of Correction gave her a certificate saying her probation had ended – leading her to believe she could begin working to restore her voting rights – but then rescinded the certificate.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: A Texas National Guard member went missing Friday after going into the river along the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across, according to a local sheriff. A woman trying to cross the Rio Grande from Mexico made it about halfway to the other side when she appeared to begin going under the water, Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said. The rescue attempt happened near Eagle Pass at a section of the river known for strong currents. “He jumped in the river,” Schmerber said. “They never saw him come out.” He said the Guard member, who has not been identified, took off his jacket and left his radio before going into the water. The woman made it across and was placed in the custody of Border Patrol, said Schmerber, whose department was involved early in the search. The Texas National Guard said in a statement that state troopers and Border Patrol agents were also helping. The attempted water rescue happened about 8:30 a.m., according to Schmerber. The Guard member was assigned to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s sprawling border security mission, known as Operation Lone Star, which has deployed thousands of Guard members across Texas’ 1,200-mile southern border since launching last year. The mission has come under scrutiny over migrants sitting in border jails for months on trespassing charges and low morale among Guard members over living conditions, long deployments and little to do.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democrats pulling hard to defeat Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee took the unusual step Saturday of spurning a party hopeful to instead get behind an independent, former presidential candidate Evan McMullin. Democrats were swayed by calls from prominent members who said McMullin, a conservative who captured a significant share of the vote in Utah in 2016, was the best chance to beat Lee in the deeply conservative state that hasn’t elected a Democratic U.S. senator for more than 50 years. “I want to represent you. I’m committed to that. I will maintain my independence,” McMullin told Democratic delegates. Lee also faced two GOP challengers at his party’s nominating conventions. He handily won in front of the right-leaning crowd with more than 70% of the vote. But those candidates will still appear on the primary ballot because they used the state’s other path to the primary ballot and gathered signatures. Former state lawmaker Becky Edwards garnered about 12% of the vote Saturday. Former gubernatorial deputy chief of staff Ally Isom came in third.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: Three Norwich University students are facing criminal charges and others being ticketed for hazing after an investigation into allegations of branding and waterboarding involving the women’s rugby team at the private military college, town police said Friday. One 22-year-old student is charged with simple assault, and another is charged with reckless endangerment in the March 20 incident. Another student, 21, is charged with both simple assault and reckless endangerment, according to the police department. They and three other students are being ticketed for hazing, a civil infraction. Five of the students are members of the women’s rugby team, and one is on the women’s lacrosse team, Norwich said. The civil infraction is handled by the Judicial Bureau and carries a fine of $1,000 to $5,000, police said. Norwich said in a statement that it has “zero-tolerance regarding hazing misconduct from our students” and will take appropriate disciplinary action now that its investigations are completed. Northfield Officer Karie Tucker said in an affidavit that she went to the school March 20 for a report of someone being held at knifepoint. Tucker said she spoke two days later to the woman, who reported she had been “branded” using pliers and a lighter by other members of the rugby team.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: A local school board has decided against buying some new social studies textbooks because of concerns from some citizens that one of the books encourages “divisive teachings,” including critical race theory. The Williamsburg-James City County school board voted 4-3 on Tuesday not to buy the books, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Board Chairman Greg Dowell said he found nothing wrong with the book’s overall content. But he said he couldn’t vote “yes” because of the controversy around it and the possibility that it could cause further “community division.” “We are transitioning out of a period of discord in our community and our country, and that takes all of us,” Dowell said. The textbook of concern is “Government in America: People, Politics and Policy,” which is often taught in Advanced Placement government and politics classes. It examines current events and public policy, while offering examples of political unrest. One citizen at Tuesday’s board meeting claimed the book was biased and left-leaning. Another said the cover photograph was a form of indoctrination. The photo is of a protest outside the U.S. Capitol with signs reading, “Silence is violence,” “No justice no peace,” and “Stop killing Black people.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The clock ran down at the end of the homecoming game, and spectators stormed the football field, knocking over members of the high school band – all to gather around an assistant coach as he took a knee in prayer, surrounded by uniformed players. Six years later, after losing his coaching job and repeatedly losing in court, that former coach, Joe Kennedy, will take his arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, saying the Bremerton School District violated his First Amendment rights by refusing to let him continue praying at midfield immediately after games. Four conservative justices have already expressed concerns with how his case has been handled. Kennedy’s effort to get his job back helped earn him an appearance at a 2016 Donald Trump rally and quickly became a cultural touchstone, pitting the religious liberties of public school employees against what his critics describe as long-standing principles separating church and state and protecting students from religious coercion. Lawyers for the school district say officials had no problem letting Kennedy pray separately from students or letting him return to the field to pray after the students had left. But allowing him to pray at midfield immediately after games with students there risked being seen as government endorsement of religion.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: All 55 counties in the state will offer early voting for this year’s primary election, which is being held May 10. Early voting starts Wednesday and continues through May 7, including the last two Saturdays before the primary, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said. Voters may cast an early ballot at the county courthouse, an annex or a designated voting location during normal business hours. On Saturdays, voting will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. West Virginia’s primary is semi-open, meaning voters who aren’t affiliated with a recognized political party may participate in the primary of the party of their choice. Unaffiliated voters must ask poll workers for the specific party’s ballot they desire, Warner’s office said. More information about in-person and absentee voting and a list of early voting sites are available online at GoVoteWV.com. Voters can also check registration at the site.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFarmington: Management of a park listed on the National Register of Historic Places has been returned to the state in hopes of better preserving more than two dozen Native American effigy mounds. The 22-acre Lizard Mound Park in Washington County was first designated as a state park in 1950. The property and its 28 effigy mounds have been owned and managed by the county since 1980 but now have been transferred back to the state’s care. Lizard Mound in Farmington has one of the largest and most intact effigy mound groups in the country, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Kettle Moraine State Forest-Northern Unit superintendent Samantha Lindquist will oversee Lizard Mound and said it won’t be run like a typical state park. “It’s not going to be managed as, say, a recreation facility,” she said. “There’s going to be a few picnic tables, but it’s not going to become overly developed. There’s not going to be all these special uses of the site. The site is an ancestral burial ground. It has cultural and historical significance. So it’s going to be preserved in that way.” As a burial ground, the Lizard Mound area is considered sacred by Native people. The Ho-Chunk consider the mound builders to be among their ancestors. While conical and linear mounds can be found throughout the Midwest, effigy mounds are unique to southern Wisconsin – the ancestral homeland of the Ho-Chunk people.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney is among recipients of this year’s John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award, with the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation citing her break with the Republican Party in defending the Constitution and opposing ex-President Donald Trump’s actions Jan. 6, 2021, as he sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Cheney voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting violence among his supporters at the U.S. Capitol after a rally on the National Mall.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}]}

Those failures caused Wells Fargo to wrongfully repossess some borrowers’ vehicles, to improperly charge fees and interest and to fail to refund certain fees, regulators say.\n\nMoreover, regulators say Wells Fargo improperly denied thousands of mortgage loan modifications, causing some customers to lose their homes in “wrongful foreclosures.”\n\n“The bank was aware of the problem for years before it ultimately addressed the issue,” the CFPB said.\n\nWells Fargo also “illegally” charged surprise overdraft fees and “unlawfully” froze more than 1 million consumer accounts, blocking consumers from accessing their funds for an average of at least two weeks.\n\nBillions in refunds to customers\n\nThe Wells Fargo scandal that began in 2016 drew a spotlight to Wells Fargo’s treatment of employees and customers, triggering Congressional hearings, countless regulatory probes and the eventual ouster of two of the bank’s CEOs.\n\nIn her final act as chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen in February 2018 threw the book at Wells Fargo by imposing unprecedented penalties on the bank that remain in place today.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday applauded the new penalties on Wells Fargo and pushed for even more.\n\n“This fine is much-needed accountability after Wells Fargo repeatedly abused consumers,” Warren said on Twitter, adding that more regulators should follow Chopra’s “lead to protect the public.\n\nThe CFPB said the more than $2 billion in customer refunds Wells Fargo has been ordered to pay includes more than $1.3 billion to consumers hurt by the bank’s auto lending tactics and more than $500 million for illegal surprise overdraft fees and other misconduct related to deposit accounts.\n\nRegulators said Wells Fargo has also been ordered to pay almost $200 million in refunds to those harmed by the bank’s mortgage servicing accounts.\n\nGoing forward, Wells Fargo has been ordered by the CFPB to make sure auto loan borrowers receive refunds for certain add-on fees and to stop charging bank account holders surprise overdraft fees.\n\nThe agency said these fees are imposed when customers have available funds at the time of purchase but then subsequently had a negative balance once the transaction settled.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-career-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "How scandals of Boris Johnson's own making brought him down ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader Thursday, bringing his scandal-plagued tenure to an end after less than three years.\n\nJohnson was left with little choice but to step down after several high-profile members of his cabinet resigned in protest this week over his handling of misconduct allegations related to government officials. Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy. The man who only ever wanted to be taken seriously ended up, ultimately, as the joker once again.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/22/lion-man-garden-state-bud-amelia-earhart-news-around-states/50125535/", "title": "Lion Man, Garden State bud: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nCORRECTION: This article originally misstated details about a museum in the works in Atchison, Kansas, the birthplace of famed aviator Amelia Earhart.

Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world.\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An organization that has staged dozens of protests against a Confederate monument in north Alabama filed suit contending the city is trying to limit the demonstrations in violation of free-speech guarantees. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Project Say Something and its founder, Camille Bennett, claims the city and Police Chief Ron Tyler are trying to clamp down on the protests by telling the group when, where and how it can demonstrate against the monument, located at the Lauderdale County Courthouse. Bennett said the organization, a nonprofit she founded about eight years ago, has tried to work with the city, the TimesDaily reports. “Alabama has a long history of confronting racial injustice through peaceful demonstration, and it is imperative that we not lose that ability to speak truth to power when the situation demands it,” Bennett said in a statement. The city has not responded to the federal lawsuit in court, and city officials declined comment. Project Say Something held as many as 175 demonstrations at the monument in 2020 but cut back the following year because the city used its noise and parade permit ordinances to discourage them, the lawsuit said. The chief relocated the demonstrations to a “protest zone” away from the courthouse to shrink the potential audience, it claimed, and he threatened to issue citations.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is in the midst of her first visit to the state in the role, including a visit to a community at the center of a long-running dispute over a proposed land exchange aimed at building a road through a national wildlife refuge. Residents of King Cove have seen a road as a life and safety issue. Haaland was in King Cove on Wednesday with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Dunleavy’s office said. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to Cold Bay, which is about 18 miles away and has an all-weather airport. The refuge is near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. “The federal government needs to consider human safety and quality of life factors for residents in King Cove. The locals deserve to be heard by the federal government,” Dunleavy said in a statement. A U.S. Justice Department attorney last summer said Haaland had not decided what position she would take on a proposed land exchange, saying Haaland planned to review the record and visit King Cove before making a decision. A planned trip to Alaska last year didn’t materialize.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Republican House speaker on Thursday was named one of five recipients of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for his refusal to consider overturning the 2020 election results despite massive pressure from ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters. Speaker Rusty Bowers rebuffed repeated direct efforts by Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to overturn results that saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona. Trump and Giuliani urged Bowers in a phone call to retroactively change Arizona law to allow the Legislature to chose a different slate of presidential electors than those picked by the voters. “I am very grateful for this honor yet cannot help but feel undeserving of it,” Bowers said in a statement. “Honoring my oath and the people’s choices at the ballot box are not heroic acts – they are the least that Arizonans should expect from the people elected to serve them.” The award created by Kennedy’s family in 1989 is designed “to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most” and is given each year to one or more political figures. This year’s award honors those who showed “courage to protect and defend democracy in the United States and abroad.” The awards will be presented at a May 22 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A local agency says it’s seeing an uptick in calls for help after the end of a statewide rent relief program. The Arkansas Department of Human Services closed its program April 1, leaving many renters struggling to find additional avenues to keep their families housed. The Arkansas Rent Relief Program provided up to 15 months of relief for unpaid rent and utilities due on or after April 1, 2020. As of the beginning of this month, about 30,000 applications had been paid at the close of the program, totaling $92.5 million in funding distributed. Some households are still waiting for assistance as their applications are being processed. As of April 7, about 3,700 applications were still being processed across the state. In the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey taken from Jan. 26 to Feb. 7, 41.4% of Arkansas households surveyed said they were not current on rent or mortgage, making eviction or foreclosure either very likely or somewhat likely in the next two months. Dana Crawford, family services manager at the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, said she has seen an uptick in calls looking for help following the closure of the state’s rental assistance program. “We did have the Arkansas Fresh Start, but we have since depleted those funds,” Crawford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Parents of middle and high school students in the state would be warned about the dangers of firearms every year under a measure that advanced Wednesday. But they would no longer be required to tell school officials if they keep guns in the house, under the revised legislation. The state Senate Education Committee three weeks ago rejected the firearms reporting requirement as an invasion of privacy. So Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino reworked his bill, eliminating the parental reporting. The narrower version cleared the same committee Wednesday on a 5-1 vote. His revised bill requires schools to include information on the safe storage of firearms in the annual notifications they send home to parents of students in middle and high schools, starting in the 2023-24 school year. Legislation with a similar requirement has already passed the California Assembly. More than two-thirds of school shootings involve weapons taken from the students’ home, friends or relatives, Portantino said. “This is an attempt to try to empower school districts to do everything they can to make the school environment safe,” he said. “This errs on the side of caution.” If there are threats or perceived threats of school shootings, the proposal requires investigators to check the state’s firearm database to see if the suspect’s family has registered firearms.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The police chief who led the force in the Denver suburb when a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater a decade ago is returning to temporarily lead the embattled department following the firing of its last chief. Daniel J. Oates, who served as police chief in Aurora from 2005 to 2014 before retiring as police chief in Miami Beach, Florida, will serve as interim chief and help in the selection of the next police chief, the city announced Wednesday. City manager Jim Twombly said he hired Oates “because he has established trust within our community and many of our officers.” Earlier this month Twombly fired Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who was hired in 2020 as the city faced scrutiny over the death of Elijah McClain – a case that received widespread attention in the wake of protests of racial injustice and police brutality. McClain died after being stopped by police, put in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine in 2019. Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted in McClain’s death last year. Wilson acted quickly to fire officers for misconduct, including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock McClain’s death. Twombly praised Wilson’s community outreach but said he fired her because of concerns about her leadership and management of the department, without getting into specifics. Wilson disputed Twombly’s assessment and alleged she was forced out for political reasons.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Emergency responders rescued 50 dogs and cats from a fire at a pet boarding facility after three people had escaped the flames by jumping from a second-floor window, authorities said Thursday. The fire was reported shortly before midnight Wednesday in a two-story building on Post Road East, Assistant Chief Jeff Gootman of the Westport Fire Department said in a news release. Firefighters responded and found heavy fire on the second floor of the building, which housed a pet boarding facility on the first floor and basement and an apartment on the second floor, Gootman said. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they searched the building and determined that the three people on the second floor had jumped to safety from a window, Gootman said. None required hospitalization. Westport firefighters and police officers removed approximately 50 dogs and cats from the boarding facility, Gootman said. The cause of the fire was under investigation Thursday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After decades of criticism over use of force and a strained relationship with the community, the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and procedures are coming under legal scrutiny. A federal lawsuit filed against Wilmington officers involved in the 2020 shooting of a man found sleeping in an SUV lists years of departmental procedures claiming city police are unable to handle many situations, including making contact with unarmed individuals. The civil lawsuit touches on documented accounts of how Wilmington officers have not been taught to give proper verbal warning prior to using deadly force or to take cover when officers believe someone is armed. The lawsuit also claims department supervisors, among others, fail to check that officers use their standard-issue equipment and fail to prohibit officers from making false statements. These failures create unwritten policies, allowing Wilmington officers to engage in acts of excessive force without accountability, which in turn result in injury to civilians, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Jabri K. Hunter, who was shot by a Wilmington officer April 12, 2020. “These inadequate training policies existed prior to the date of this incident and continue to this day,” said the lawsuit targeting the officers involved in the shooting, Chief Robert Tracy and the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and other community leaders announced Thursday that the city’s annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness showed a decline for the sixth straight year, WUSA-TV reports. Over the past year, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has dropped 13.7%. Since 2016, when the Bowser administration began its Homeward DC plan, homelessness has declined by 47% total, data show. For the 2016 Point in Time count, 8,350 people were experiencing homelessness. In 2022, that number was 4,410. That’s the lowest recorded number going back to at least 2005, the mayor’s office said. The 2022 results also show declines in family homelessness (down 14%), homelessness among single adults (down 12%), and chronic homelessness for families (down 26%) and single adults (down 22%). “These results are a culmination of years of working together – across government, with our community partners and providers, and with residents in all eight wards – to implement Homeward DC and build systems and resources that meet the needs of D.C. residents,” Bowser said in a statement. “While we are proud of these results, we know there’s more work to do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the Florida House floor Thursday to protest a congressional map pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that they say will diminish the state’s Black representation in the U.S. House. The DeSantis map would increase Florida’s GOP presence and dismantle two districts now represented by Black members of Congress. As debate on the maps was nearing an end, Reps. Angie Nixon and Tray McCurdy opened up their suit jackets to display “Stop the Black Attack” T-shirts and shouted the same phrase. They sat on the state seal in front of the House speaker’s rostrum and were soon joined by other other Black Democrats and other supporters. The Republican-led chamber called a recess, all GOP lawmakers left the floor, and the state Florida Channel stopped broadcasting the proceedings. “This is good trouble! Necessary trouble!” Nixon shouted, echoing a phrase used by the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. The group sang “We Shall Overcome” and prayed. Some members went on Facebook to stream live feeds of the protest. Nixon said in a text message to the Associated Press that the lawmakers would not leave the floor unless they were physically removed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams’ gubernatorial campaign asked a federal judge Wednesday to shut down unlimited contributions to a committee controlled by Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. The filing is yet more litigation over the constitutionality of a 2021 Georgia law that allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits and coordinate spending with campaigns. The judge earlier denied a request by Abrams to start taking unlimited amounts before she clinches the Democratic nomination May 24. Kemp narrowly beat Abrams in the 2018 general election, and they would match up again if Kemp survives a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue and others. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Donors can give as much as they want, while they can’t directly give candidates for statewide office more than $7,600 for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. Opponents say the law unconstitutionally favors incumbents over challengers because they can raise limitless sums for years ahead of an election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Public school students must continue wearing masks in classrooms despite state officials lifting the same rules for airports and public transportation following Monday’s federal judge decision to remove mask requirements on U.S. flights. Masks are no longer required in Hawaii airports, on city buses or in handicapped vans, but all public students will be required to wear masks through the end of the school year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “I understand that there are different perspectives regarding the Hawaii State Department of Education’s indoor masking in schools,” interim Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in a letter to parents. “We will continue to implement universal indoor masking in schools.” Federal transportation officials announced Monday that they would no longer enforce mask rules after a U.S. judge’s decision to strike down the mandate on domestic flights. The four largest U.S. airlines almost immediately dropped their mask requirements, and Hawaiian Airlines announced late Monday that it would follow suit. “We ask for our guests’ patience and understanding as we update all our communications and announcements,” the airline said. “We advise travelers to stay informed and follow mask requirements that may remain in effect at their origin or arrival airports.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men have been sentenced to jail time and banned from hunting for years after pleading guilty to poaching a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said in a press release that Rex Baum, 79, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the female grizzly’s death last year. He was ordered to serve 3 days in jail and was banned from hunting for a decade. Baum’s son, Jared Baum, of Ashton, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and banned from hunting for life after pleading guilty to a felony in connection with the incident. Fish and Game officers discovered the grizzly’s carcass April 9, 2021, after the bear’s radio tracking collar signaled it had died, the Idaho Statesman reports. X-rays of the bear showed she had been shot more than a dozen times. Conservation officers visited the bear’s den, discovering a dead male cub. The agency contacted the two men after sending a warrant to Google for records of electronic devices that had been in the area around the time of the grizzly’s death. Idaho grizzlies are federally protected. Last month, Gov. Brad Little joined Montana and Wyoming governors in petitioning for the bears to be removed from Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The city will have a starring role in the state’s latest marketing campaign, with the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Cozy Dog Drive-In, and other sites featured in the new promotion. Gov. J.B. Pritzker officially announced the new campaign, “Middle of Everything,” at a ceremony Monday at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium. While the Windy City is spotlighted heavily, Springfield gets plenty of love as well, with sites related to the 16th president, such as Lincoln’s Home and Lincoln’s Tomb, promoted in addition to the museum and a statue of Lincoln sitting on a park bench outside the museum. Pritzker said the $30 million campaign would help to recover tourism dollars lost during the COVID-19 pandemic and put the state in a position to grow in the years to come. A series of TV ads will run with the campaign, directed by Illinois native Jane Lynch, famous for roles such as in the TV series “Glee” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” The Dolton-raised actor, a graduate of Illinois State University, narrates a quartet of 30-second ads that showcase a Lincoln impersonator at the Lincoln Home, a muscle car at the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices downtown, Lynch interviewing a family at the Cozy Dog and speaking with a ghost of Lincoln at “Ghosts of the Library” in the ALPLM, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Thomas McDermott Jr. released a new video ad Wednesday of him smoking marijuana in honor of 4/20, a cannabis-related celebration. McDermott, who will face Republican Sen. Todd Young on Nov. 8, has been vocal about his support for the legalization of marijuana, but the video of him lighting it up is a first. In the video the Hammond mayor posted on Twitter, McDermott lights a joint and smokes it in an Illinois backyard, where marijuana consumption has been legalized. He talks to an attorney, a physician, a criminal defense attorney, a professional distiller and another elected official about the benefits of legalizing weed. “Here’s the bottom line,” McDermott says in the video. “We need to legalize marijuana on the federal level. We need to also legalize cannabis in Indiana as well, so Hoosiers can get the health and economic benefits of cannabis.” The mayor admitted last year on his “Left of Center” podcast that he smoked marijuana at a recent Grateful Dead show at Wrigley Field. McDermott unveiled the ad the same day the Indiana Democratic Party launched a tour to push marijuana legalization. It started publicly advocating for the policy change in November, but with Republicans in control at the Statehouse, it went nowhere in the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: This year’s Major League Baseball Field of Dreams game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs will have an opening act. The Cedar Rapids Kernels and Quad Cities River Bandits will play a regular season minor league baseball game in the stadium located near the iconic diamond from the movie Aug. 9. That showdown is set to take place just two days before MLB’s second-straight visit to the famous farmland and in the same ballpark used last season by the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds will play on the same field Aug. 11. “I think it just adds to an entire week now up there,” said Kernels general manager Scott Wilson. “Instead of just one night even with the major league game, you’ve got Tuesday night with us. It gives the Field of Dreams some opportunity to do some things on Wednesday between us and have that game on Thursday.” It’s a marquee matchup of minor league teams have been rivals in the Midwest League for years. The River Bandits are the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Kernels are the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The two teams, who are are located in Eastern Iowa, will become the first two minor league teams to play on the field.\n\nKansas\n\nAtchison: Aviator Amelia Earhart vanished as she tried to fly around the world in 1937, along with navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra 10-E airplane. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world. That museum is in the works in Atchison, Earhart’s birthplace. Museum founder and president Karen Seaberg announced last week that supporters had already donated $10 million of the estimated $15 million needed to create the museum, including corporate powerhouses FedEx, Garmin and Lockheed Martin. The museum is expected to open next year, according to its website. Earhart, born in 1897 in Atchison, was a social worker in Boston in 1923 when she became the 16th woman in the U.S. to be issued a pilot’s license. She subsequently became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. She was also the first woman to fly nonstop across the U.S. She became a celebrity and drew attention by rejecting traditional women’s roles and speaking in support of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Earhart also created her own line of women’s clothing, featuring comfortable outfits designed for “active living.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he will form an advisory team amid a broad review as he weighs whether to take executive action to legalize access to medical marijuana. Beshear said he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action to create a framework to make medical cannabis available for people suffering from specified ailments. The Democratic governor also made a direct appeal to Kentuckians to offer their views on the issue. “I want to be clear: I am for medical cannabis,” Beshear said at his weekly news conference. “I want it done in the right way. And we’re going to be looking at our legal options very closely. And at the same time, we want to hear from you.” The advisory team will travel the state to gather public input, and Kentuckians will be able to express their views directly to the governor’s office, he said. The expanded review reflects the governor’s growing frustration after the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate during the legislative session that ended last week. Lawmakers failed to “get the job done,” with Kentucky falling behind the majority of states that make medical cannabis available as an alternative to opioid medications, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge and court-appointed monitors hired to oversee reform of the New Orleans Police Department said Wednesday that the long-troubled agency could reach full compliance this year after a nearly decade-old court-backed overhaul of its policies and practices. “I’m proud of how far NOPD has come,” U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan, who approved the agreement in 2013 a highly critical 2011 investigation and report by the U.S. Justice Department. Morgan tempered her praise with acknowledgment of continuing problems, including the short-handed department’s slowdown in recruiting and allegations of wrongdoing by officers who work private duty details arranged through the department. But the department has shown transparency in dealing with such setbacks, Morgan said. The reform agreement, embodied in a court document called a consent decree, was welcomed by department critics when it was negotiated during former Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s administration. They said it was needed for a department that had been plagued by recurring scandals involving corruption or questionable use of force for decades. But the consent decree had its critics as well, including police officer representatives who said it hampered police work.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed off on a $1.2 billion supplemental budget Wednesday that sends more than half the money to residents in the form of $850 relief checks. Backed by dozens of lawmakers and Cabinet members, the governor signed the bill into law in the State House Hall of Flags. “What this budget shows once again – through hard work and good faith negotiation – Democrats, Republicans and independents can come together to do what is right for Maine people. And that we can do so without rancor or bitter partisanship that has sometimes divided Augusta in the past,” she told the assembly. The swift action means the checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 Mainers as early as June. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the budget proposal in a show of bipartisanship. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers, taking a suggestion from Republicans as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. It was originally touted as pandemic relief but is now called inflationary relief. Mills’ opponent in the upcoming election, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, derided the relief checks as a “gimmick.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed measures into law Thursday aimed at increasing public safety, jobs, environmental stewardship and mental health resources. The Republican governor, who prioritized initiatives to support the police and fight crime this legislative session, signed legislation to increase transparency in the criminal justice system and to create a state gun analytics center to coordinate resources to screen and vet gun cases to improve the prosecution of gun crimes. “Violent crime continues to be Marylanders’ top priority, and today we’re signing our Judicial Transparency Act so that the public knows more about the sentences that are being handed down for violent criminals,” Hogan said. “We’re further expanding our warrant apprehension efforts and strengthening prosecutions on gun crimes.” Hogan opened his remarks before signing 103 bills with House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith by noting it was the first time two Black women were the presiding officers representing the Maryland House and Senate together at a bill signing. The criminal justice measures marked a compromise between the Republican governor and the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMartha’s Vineyard: A local family will go to court Friday over its continuing fight over a piece of land in Aquinnah that the Kennedy family donated to the Vineyard Conservation Society in 2013. Tanisha Gomes and her family say they are the rightful owners of that 5.7-acre property and are challenging the society’s motion for summary judgment, which asks a judge to throw out the case. In 2017, Gomes received a letter from Fidelity National Law Group, a firm that represents Vineyard Conservation Society Inc., to inform her and 19 members of her family about title problems with the land. The letter informed Gomes and her relatives that a lawsuit was filed with Dukes County Superior Court against the family, who are considered heirs of Louisa Pocknett. Pocknett, described in the complaint as the former owner of the property, died Aug. 29, 1874, and was a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The family members were asked to sign an agreement to verify they had no right, title or interest in Lot 240, which was indicated on a plan entitled “Plan of Gay Head.” After further research, Gomes and her family found that Lot 240 remains in Pocknett’s name on the town of Aquinnah’s assessor’s website and objected to the lawsuit due to discrepancies surrounding incomplete deeds.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican state Sen. Lana Theis opened a session with an invocation by claiming children are being attacked by “forces” that want to indoctrinate them with ideas their parents do not support. Three Democrats walked out of last week’s meeting to protest her apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation and gender identity and critical race theory. Within days, one who tweeted criticism of the prayer was targeted by Theis in a fundraising email, calling Sen. Mallory McMorrow a liberal social media “troll” and accusing her of wanting to “groom” and “sexualize” kindergartners and teach “that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.” McMorrow responded Tuesday with a forceful, impassioned floor speech that resonated nationwide. “I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom” who wants “every kid to feel seen, heard and supported – not marginalized and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian,” she said. Theis, who declined to speak after the session, released a statement in which she did not apologize but again accused Democrats of trying to undermine parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education. McMorrow’s 5-minute speech found an engaged audience on social media, racking up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mike Dando, a St. Cloud State University English professor, has helped to create a new superhero comic and is aiming to teach students in grades 5-12 literacy skills, critical thinking and self-reflection this summer through an often overlooked medium. Exploring concepts like Afrofuturism and the African diaspora, students can imagine new worlds by reading and analyzing the story of the first Black superhero, Lion Man. In 2018, after the highly successful “Black Panther” movie debuted, Dando worked with a group of artists and professors around the world to revisit Lion Man, the first Black superhero comic, written in 1947 by Black Philadelphia journalist Orrin Cromwell Evans. The original story follows Lion Man, a scientist turned superhero tasked by the United Nations to watch over a magical mountain full of uranium in Africa to prevent war. When All-Negro Comics Inc.’s paper supplier refused to help the company produce another book because its founders were Black, only one Lion Man issue was ever published – until now. Dando’s new, much longer Lion Man comic book follows the character’s journey of self-discovery and heroism as he works to save a group of other heroes trapped in monstrous bodies. He served as editor and project manager for the work written by John Jennings and illustrated by David Brame. Thanks to a grant from St. Cloud State, the team was able to make copies of the comic book – one of which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – and Dando will work with a variety of after-school clubs this summer to talk about the narrative structure and themes of the book, as well as teach students how to make their own comics.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Volunteers on Thursday planted several types of grasses along a stretch of Mississippi Gulf Coast beach to help restore habitat for newly hatched Least Tern chicks. Audubon Delta, along with Harrison County Sand Beach Authority and Gulfport High School, partnered to install several species of beach grasses into a globally recognized conservation zone in Gulfport in order to stabilize the beach, encourage dune formation and provide coverage for the endangered birds. The area was destroyed after hurricanes Ida and Zeta and several tropical storms over the past two years, officials said. The project was made possible by a Caring for Our Coasts grant issued by Citgo and Restore America’s Estuaries.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City leaders on Thursday announced plans for a new institute designed to make the region a major player in geospatial technology. Andy Taylor, executive chairman of the rental car company Enterprise Holdings, is providing financing for the Taylor Geospatial Institute, along with eight St. Louis-area research institutions. The institute will provide funding for research and program development and expects to attract leading scientists to St. Louis, organizers said. Taylor said in a statement that he hopes the institute “will cement St. Louis as the world’s true center for geospatial excellence.” A news release says research and training will focus on topics such as food security, improving health care systems, and national security. Officials did not disclose how much money the Taylor family is investing, but the family has funded more than $1 billion in St. Louis civic initiatives and cultural institutions through the years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers have rejected an attempt to call a special legislative session to investigate the state’s election processes amid continued false claims by ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen. A poll of 149 lawmakers found just 44 approving a special session by Tuesday’s deadline, short of the 75 needed. The secretary of state’s tally showed 60 lawmakers rejected the special session, and another 45 didn’t return their ballots, which counts as a “no” vote. One legislative seat is vacant. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers tried to reach an agreement to ask Gov. Greg Gianforte to call a special session to create new voting districts for the Public Service Commission before three federal judges had to decide how to even out the populations in the five districts. However, GOP leaders were unable to get a commitment from all Republicans to limit the special session to addressing just the voting districts. Gianforte said he would not call a special session without such an agreement. After the court set the PSC districts for the 2022 elections, 10 lawmakers asked for the poll on whether lawmakers wanted to hold a special session on election integrity.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson endorsed state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks on Thursday in her campaign for the state’s 1st Congressional District. Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, is looking to replace former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who resigned after he was convicted on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal campaign contribution. Nelson, a Democrat, said Pansing Brooks has worked with both parties while in the Nebraska Legislature and passed more than 60 bills. Pansing Brooks will face state Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, in a June 28 special election to determine who will serve the remainder of Fortenberry’s term in Congress. She’s also expected to face Flood again in November, assuming that they both win their parties’ May 10 primary nomination as expected. Nelson is the most recent Democrat to have served as Nebraska’s governor, with a tenure from 1991 to 1999. He was a U.S. senator from 2001 to 2013. Pansing Brooks has served in the Legislature since 2015 and is leaving office in January due to term limits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Most of the five leading Republican candidates for governor who gathered Wednesday for a campaign forum offered dire assessments of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, rising crime and struggling schools – and asked for votes for their visions to fix them. Several also blamed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the consensus GOP front-runner, for skipping the event. “We want to have the best, well-run, state in the country,” said Guy Nohra, a Reno venture capitalist, drawing applause from among about 100 people at a Republican women’s club luncheon in Las Vegas. “But we don’t. We’re 50th in everything,” said Nora, who called his foray into politics the culmination of an American dream after his own teenage experience fighting a war in his home country, Lebanon, and his business ventures in the U.S. The event also featured North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, Gardnerville surgeon Fred Simon, former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and firebrand northern Nevada lawyer Joey Gilbert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House approved a resolution Thursday in support of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary before advancing a bill opponents said would threaten it. The nonbinding resolution came a week after the Democratic National Committee approved a plan to revoke the guaranteed first-place spots in the presidential nominating calendar long held by the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Noting New Hampshire has withstood previous challenges, lawmakers affirmed their commitment to the tradition and said candidates are well-served by campaigning in a state with an engaged citizenry and “well-run, free and fair elections.” But a supporter of a bill to create a provisional ballot system later called the current system “laughable,” claiming it allows people to cast fraudulent ballots with virtually no consequences. Under current law, voters who arrive at the polls without the necessary identification fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days; those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. The votes themselves remain valid, but under a bill sent to the House Finance Committee on Thursday, the state would create a new type of “affidavit ballots” that would be thrown out if voters fail to follow up. Opponents called it an expensive and complicated solution to a problem that doesn’t exist and said creating a system that would delay the final results for more than a week would threaten the state’s ability to hold the first primary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBloomfield: The flowers were finally on full display Thurday as recreational marijuana sales began in the Garden State. Michael Barrows wore his Grateful Dead T-shirt and Jerry Garcia face mask for opening day of legal cannabis sales and was one of dozens of people who lined up before dawn to join the celebratory scene. “It’s pretty amazing, exciting, and if I get pulled over on the way home, and I’m ever asked if I have any drugs in the car, now I’m allowed to say ‘only this,’ ” Barrows said, holding up the canister of marijuana flower he had just purchased. Possession of cannabis is legal now in New Jersey, though driving under the influence is still prohibited. Barrows, 60, joined a steady stream of other novelty-seekers, longtime marijuana users and medical patients at RISE in Bloomfield, near the state’s biggest city, Newark, and not far from New York City. With soul music blaring, free doughnuts in the parking lot, a steel drum and a balloon arch at the entrance, New Jersey’s cannabis kickoff for people 21 and older had the feel of a fair more than a store opening. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has long backed recreational marijuana legalization and signed the bill that set up the new marketplace kicking off at 13 existing medical marijuana facilities across the state, appeared at ZenLeaf in Elizabeth for its first day of recreational sales. The governor said he wouldn’t be trying any pot; earlier this week he said it’s not his “thing,” and he prefers scotch.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Habitat for about a million bats will be protected from human impacts through a deal between a nonprofit and the federal government. About 315,000 acres of southern New Mexico land owned by billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner were protected from development in a partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and New Mexico Land Conservancy. The deal saw a conservation easement added to Armendaris Ranch, owned by Turner, due to perceived cultural significance and biological diversity on the land in Sierra and Socorro counties. The ranch land supports more than 500 vertebrate species, according to a report from the Land Conservancy, including multiple listed for federal and state protections. It also contains the Fra Cristobal Mountain Range, home to 230 desert bighorn sheep, and lava fields that include the Jornada cave system that houses bats of multiple species. “This land is laden with important and unique natural and cultural resources, and the opportunity to permanently protect a property with conservation values of this magnitude was at the heart of our organization’s decision to tackle this landscape-scale project,” said Ron Troy, southern New Mexico program manager with the Land Conservancy.\n\nNew York\n\nOlive: As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The fight over a downtown Confederate marker is not over, according to the attorney challenging the city’s removal of Vance Monument, and documents filed Wednesday attempt to take the issue to North Carolina’s highest court. Despite an April 5 ruling from the N.C. Court of Appeals in favor of the city, affirming a lower court judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing removal of the monument, the city finds itself again in limbo. Nearing midnight Wednesday, Edward Phillips, lawyer for the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops, which brought the challenge against the city, filed a petition for discretionary review with the N.C. Supreme Court. This document is a request for the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Court of Appeals. It does not ensure the high court will hear an appeal, said City Attorney Brad Branham. “I am not going to cede the point until I’m told there’s just no path forward,” Phillips said. The filings add to an already lengthy process to determine the fate of the obelisk that was built to honor racist Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance. The 75-foot-tall granite Vance Monument stood in Pack Square Plaza in the heart of downtown Asheville. All but its base was taken down as of June 2021 after the City Council voted to remove it. The historical preservation group is seeking to stop and potentially reconstruct the monument to Vance.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state and several western counties that could have resulted in the construction of additional roads in parts of the Badlands. The Badlands Conservation Alliance says the ruling protects some of the most pristine areas of the Badlands from traffic and potential oil development. “I think it’s a really serious win for the Badlands, for the long-term integrity of those areas that are still roadless and considered suitable for wilderness,” said Connie Triplett, president of the alliance. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s and counties’ claim is barred by a 12-year statute of limitations that was passed years ago. Their ruling upholds an earlier decision by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, who dismissed the matter in 2017, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The case began a decade ago when Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie and Slope counties sued the federal government. The state followed with its own lawsuit, and the court consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs sought to claim rights to section lines used in land surveying and mapping in the Little Missouri National Grassland and other areas that make up the Dakota Prairie Grasslands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A lawsuit has been filed targeting legal protections granted to health care providers that allow them to deny treatment they oppose on the basis of their conscience or religious beliefs. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on Wednesday sued the state over the measure known as the “conscience clause.” According to the law, a medical provider can be “excused from participating” whenever a treatment conflicts with a provider’s “moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or convictions.” Opponents of the law say it could limit abortions or other medical care. The city also argues the measure violates Ohio’s Constitution and the federal Affordable Care Act. If nurses employed by the city are opposed to a medical procedure, “they can refuse it, and we as a city can’t do anything about it,” Klein said. He also said insurance companies could refuse to pay for certain procedures, and “that obviously causes significant problems for our employees.” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine kept the language of the law in place when he signed the 2021 budget. DeWine said the provision merely sets into state law what’s already being practiced. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the lawsuit “meritless, anti-democracy and authoritarian.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Plans to fully legalize marijuana can proceed to the signature-gathering stage, the state Supreme Court ruled, paving the way for two more cannabis plans seeking voter approval. The high court’s ruling late Tuesday comes amid a marijuana boom in the Sooner State after voters in 2018 approved the most liberal medical marijuana program in the nation. Nearly 10% of Oklahoma’s 4 million residents have qualified for a medical-use card – by far the highest percentage in the country. Supporters of the two separate proposals still need to gather enough signatures to put the plans on the ballot for voters. The plans approved Tuesday, State Question 819 and a companion State Question 818, would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to protect the right of residents age 21 and older to use marijuana. It’s part of a nationwide push to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults, which 18 states and the District of Columbia have already approved. Because the two proposals seek to amend the constitution, supporters will have to gather more signatures, about 178,000 in 90 days, for them to qualify for the ballot. “Whether we’ll get on the November ballot this year remains to be seen,” said Jed Green, a longtime Oklahoma cannabis activist behind the plans. “We’re going to push, push and push to get it done.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Native American tribe in the state said it is assessing its legal options after learning the U.S. government plans to release water from a federally operated reservoir to downstream farmers along the Oregon-California border amid a historic drought. Even limited irrigation for the farmers who use Klamath River water on about 300 square miles of crops puts two critically endangered fish species in peril of extinction because the water withdrawals come at the height of spawning season, the Klamath Tribes said. Last year, critically endangered sucker fish central to the Klamath Tribes culture and religion didn’t have enough water to spawn, and thousands of downstream juvenile salmon died without reservoir releases to support the Klamath River’s health. The tribes said in a statement that the decision to release any water to about 1,000 farmers in the massive, federal agricultural project was “perhaps the saddest chapter yet in a long history of treaty violations” and placed the blame for the current water crisis on “120 years of ecosystem mismanagement at the hands of settler society.” The fish are important to the inland tribes’ cultural and religious practices and were once a dietary staple. The Klamath stopped fishing for the sucker fish in the 1980s as numbers dwindled. They now run a captive breeding program to ensure the species’ survival and note that no juvenile sucker fish have survived in the wild in recent years. “We have nothing left with which to ‘compromise,’ ” the Klamath Tribes said in a statement. “Global warming is certainly a global problem, but thus far its local consequences appear to be exacerbating existing and systematic inequalities between ourselves and the larger society.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors said Thursday that they will not re-try a Philadelphia man whose 2012 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month, citing weak evidence and the involvement of a disgraced former detective now charged with sexually assaulting witnesses in other cases. Rafiq Dixon, 40, had been serving a life sentence in the 2011 fatal shooting of Joseph Pinkney. The 40-year-old was expected to be released from prison Thursday afternoon, hours after a Common Pleas Court judge granted the motion to withdraw charges, his attorney said. The initial case relied heavily on testimony from three witnesses who gave inconsistent accounts. All three were interviewed by former homicide detective Philip Nordo, who has been charged with various crimes including stalking, intimidating, and sexually assaulting male suspects and witnesses during his career. In June, a judge reversed the 2015 conviction of Arkel Garcia, who confessed to murder during an interrogation in which, his lawyer said, Nordo asked the teenager to view pornography with him. The ruling came after both sides presented evidence that Nordo had sexually groomed witnesses in the case and trial prosecutors had suppressed his misconduct. Garcia was also serving a life sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic former state lawmaker David Segal has joined the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a fellow Democrat who’s retiring after more than two decades in office. Segal announced his decision Wednesday, saying that many voters are fed up with federal politics and that “government should be able to do more to address the concerns of our neighbors.” Segal served on the Providence City Council before winning a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He served for two terms, from 2007 to 2011. In 2010 he lost a bid for Congress and founded a national liberal advocacy organization known as Demand Progress. He’s the latest entry in a crowded Democratic field that also includes state Treasurer Seth Magaziner; Joy Fox, a former top aide to Langevin; Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau; Omar Bah, executive director of the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; and former political strategist Michael Neary. “We have the people power to reach the voters, we have the money to compete, and we have the urgent case to make that we deserve leaders who can bring people together and ensure their voices are heard,” Segal said in his campaign announcement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Wednesday issued a temporary stay blocking the state from carrying out what was set to be its first-ever firing squad execution. The order by the state Supreme Court puts on hold at least temporarily the planned April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, who drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. The court said in issuing the temporary stay that it would release a more detailed order later. Attorneys for the 57-year-old inmate had sought a stay, citing pending litigation in another court challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina’s execution methods, which also include the electric chair. Moore’s lawyers also wanted time to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether Moore’s sentence was proportionate to his crime. It has been more than a decade since the last firing squad execution in the U.S. The state of Utah carried out all three such executions in the nation since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The most recent was in 2010. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday also set a May 13 execution date for Brad Sigmon, 64, convicted in 2002 of the double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s parents in Greenville County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A leadership shake-up and shorter wait times for service are welcomed changes for disgruntled military veterans who say the federal health care system is failing them, but that’s still not enough to appease the dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as a handful of elected officials, who showed up at the South Dakota Veterans Council’s quarterly meeting Wednesday. Praises of this week’s removal of the now-former Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs director were tempered by caution for a need for more systematic improvements. “If you walked the halls on Tuesday, there were more smiles in the Sioux Falls VA Hospital than there have been in 14 months,” said Hawk Mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran, referring to the departure of now former Sioux Falls VA director Lisa Simoneau. “But we’ve been shut out.” Simoneau was removed from the position as of Monday after growing pressure for a regime change from both veterans, VA employees and South Dakota’s congressional delegation. Since at least October, members of the South Dakota Veterans Council have voiced concerns about a lack of responsiveness from Simoneau regarding what’s described as an inadequate level of care being provided to veterans entitled to medical services through the veterans’ health care system. Some employees at the VA have also blown the whistle in recent weeks on poor management practices and a hostile work environment under Simoneau.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would become the latest to impose harsh penalties on doctors who violate new, strict regulations dictating the dispensing of abortion pills under a proposal headed to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. It’s part of a coordinated nationwide effort spearheaded by anti-abortion groups upset over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to remove a rule that required women to pick up the abortion medication in person. After Tennessee’s GOP-controlled House approved the measure last week, Senate Republicans on Thursday signed off on sending the proposal to the governor. Lee hasn’t publicly weighed in on the measure, but he has yet to veto a bill while in office and frequently stresses his opposition to abortion. According to the bill, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed, and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills. The drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians – effectively barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine. The in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A prominent conservative activist has been charged with unlawful restraint and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon over an October incident involving a contractor the activist hired, his attorneys said Wednesday. Jared Woodfill and Gary Polland, attorneys for Dr. Steven Hotze, said the Harris County District Attorney’s Office told them Wednesday that Hotze was indicted over allegations against a former police officer, Mark Aguirre, who worked for Hotze. Aguirre had been retained to pursue a voter fraud investigation on behalf of Houston-based Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization Hotze runs. Aguirre was charged Dec. 14 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after a man accused him of running him off the road and holding him at gunpoint in an effort to prove what authorities have called a bogus voter fraud scheme. Aguirre claimed an air conditioner repairman was the mastermind. He said the man’s truck was filled with fraudulent ballots when he ran his SUV into it Oct. 19, according to authorities. Aguirre told police he and some friends set up a “command post” at a Marriott hotel in suburban Houston that conducted 24-hour surveillance on the repairman for four days, according to a police affidavit.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Faced with continuing drought and one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., the Washington County Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to apply new water restrictions to every new residential and commercial development. The new rules won’t apply to any existing homes or commercial buildings, but they could hopefully provide a better balance between what water is available and the continued demand for new construction, said Adam Snow, a member of the three-member commission, which regulates buildings requirements for all of the unincorporated areas of the county. “We want to have beautiful communities and a beautiful place to live and maintain our quality of life,” Snow said. “We’re doing it as effectively and efficiently as possible with our water, which is a very sacred resource right now.” The changes will be written into Title 10, Chapter 27 of the county code. They will only apply to projects on unincorporated county land that still need approval from the county to go forward, although they resemble similar measures being passed by cities and towns in the area. Snow said about 5% of the county’s population lives on unincorporated land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Property owned by Vermont-recognized Native American tribes will be exempt from property taxes under a new law that takes effect in July. The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, recognizes that Vermont lands “are the historic and current territories of the Western Abenaki people.” “I sign it out of respect for the heritage of our Native American communities and traditions,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “Further, the associated costs to the Education Fund and the General Fund borne by all Vermonters are forecast to be negligible.” To be exempt from the state and municipal property taxes, the property must be used for the purposes of the tribe and not leased or rented. Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation, has said the tax exemption allows the tribes, which rely on grants and donations, to be able to use those resources “to help uplift our people” with food security and other needs. The legislation states that “stewardship of these lands was removed from the Abenaki by European governments and settlers” and acknowledges “the Abenaki people as the traditional land caretakers of Ndakinna, which includes parts of Vermont, New England, and Quebec.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWestlake: Officials at Booker T. Washington National Monument are asking the public for help in unraveling one of its biggest mysteries. Hidden away in a section of the park just off its Jack O’ Lantern Trail rests a cemetery that predates much of the known history of the former plantation where Booker T. Washington was born a slave and later freed. The cemetery has few markings to provide context to who was buried there or when they were buried. “It’s definitely one of the biggest mysteries at the park,” said Tim Sims, senior park ranger. Archaeologist with New South Associates recently began taking a deeper look into the cemetery, commonly referred to as the Sparks Cemetery named after a person who once lived nearby. Some of the Black families who have lived near the cemetery include the Brown, Holland, Divers, Burroughs, Ferguson, Taylor, Green, Harris, English, Edwards, Starkey, Swain, Saunders, Childress and Dudley families. Sims said the names of the families were found looking through property deeds, slave records and federal census records. People with information on those possibly buried in the Sparks Cemetery are asked to contact Velma Fann, historian, at New South Associates at 770-498-4155, x126 or vfann@newsouthassoc.com.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that an Edmonds city ordinance requiring that guns be locked up and kept out of unauthorized hands is preempted by state law. The ruling affirmed a three-judge state of appeals ruling last year in the case sparked by a lawsuit filed by three residents against the city of Edmonds after it approved an ordinance in July 2018 requiring residents to lock up their guns or else face fines. “Under our system of divided government, many elected bodies hold legislative power, including elected city councils. These councils, however, must legislate within constitutional constraints,” Chief Justice Steven González wrote, joined by the eight other justices on the high court. “One of those constraints is that city ordinances must not ‘conflict with general laws’ that have been enacted by the people of our state by initiative or by our state legislature.” A statewide ballot measure that passed later that same year on gun safety doesn’t mandate that a firearm be stored in a particular way or place, but it created criminal penalties for when a gun isn’t properly stored and accessed by someone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm – such as a child – and used to injure or kill, displayed in public in an intimidating manner or used during a crime.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A health care system has partnered with a junior college on a program aimed at addressing the shortage of nurses in the state. Mon Health System and West Virginia Junior College signed a letter of intent to launch a nursing education program that will put students at the school on an accelerated path to becoming nurses, officials said during a signing ceremony Monday. Mon Health nurses will serve as faculty, and the students will have digital coursework as well as learning through work at the hospital – what Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg called patient-side, The Dominion Post reports. The program plans to open enrollment in September and start its first class next April. The collaboration, Goldberg said, will serve “to bring not only the best nurses to patient-side through Mon Health, but keep people in this community, grow our own, take care of our own neighbors, family members and friends, so we continue to be the best health care location in north-central West Virginia and improve our health care outcomes.” West Virginia Junior College CEO Chad Callen said nursing shortages are at near crisis levels in some areas of the state. “Such challenges require bold thinking and innovative, out-of-the-box approaches,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker in the state as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves snakes and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman’s reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman’s website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s senior population grew at the nation’s second-fastest rate in the second decade of the millennium, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.

Ron DeSantis and Rubio comfortably won reelection as voter concerns about the economy appeared to prevail over a message emphasized by Democrats focusing on abortion rights.\n\nIncumbent Florida Gov.

Elissa Slotkin wins in Michigan\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich, won reelection over Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a harsh Trump critic, Barrett was endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence. Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has focused his campaign on less spending, more energy production and criticism of Slotkin's voting record. Slotkin has struck back at Barrett's refusal to say if he would have accepted the results of the 2020 election, which he has called an \"unknowable thing.\"\n\n– Yoori Han, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman unseats Ohio Rep.

Evers had been a school district superintendent and served as the statewide superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin for nearly a decade.\n\nAs governor, Evers’s job approval has been slightly underwater in recent Marquette polls, with 46% approving of the job he’s been doing as governor and 48% disapproving.\n\nMichels is backed by former President Donald Trump, who has traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for him. The once low-key owner of Wisconsin’s largest construction company, the eponymous Michels Corp, Michels launched his bid for governor in April -- about 15 months after Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project for which Michels’ company had a contract to build pump stations. It’s Michels’ third run for office.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nLive updates:Wisconsin Election Results 2022\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wins reelection\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed victory in her bid for reelection as Michigan governor, successfully fending off a challenge by Republican nominee Tudor Dixon.\n\nThe contest, once seen as an easy win for Democrats in a major battleground state, tightened in the final weeks with a last minute push by the Dixon campaign helping her to inch closer in the polls.\n\nWhitmer is a veteran of Michigan politics, serving six years in the state House and eight in the senate before being elected governor in 2018.\n\nDixon spent years as a conservative TV commentator and producer of conservative news for students.\n\nDixon, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, denies the results of the 2020 election and has criticized Whitmer for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fetterman and Oz have been vying for the open seat created by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement.\n\n\"It's official. I will be the next U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman tweeted early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTexas Democrat Vicente Gonzalez reelected to House\n\nRep.

But Gonzalez’ win is a blow to those efforts.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nNo victory or concession speeches tonight from Nevada Democrats\n\nJust as the crowd doubled in size at the Democratic ticket's election party on the Las Vegas Strip, Nevada's top candidates took the stage to thank their supporters – and encourage them to \"go home.\"\n\nSen.

Henry Cuellar reelected in Texas\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar won reelection Tuesday, fending off an aggressive play by Republicans to remake the U.S.-Mexico border into a midterm battleground.\n\nCuellar’s victory over Republican Cassy Garcia holds the line for Democrats in an important stronghold for the party. Garcia was one of three Republican Latina candidates who ran competitive House races along the border after the GOP made inroads with Hispanic voters in 2020.\n\nCuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House and narrowly survived a primary challenge this spring from a progressive challenger.\n\n– Paul J. Weber and Acacia Coronado, Associated Press\n\nRazor-thin margin in Georgia Senate race\n\nATLANTA – Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock told supporters late Tuesday he remains confident as Republican opponent Herschel Walker holds a razor-thin lead.\n\nWalker was ahead by less than 7,000 votes as votes continue to be counted as the clock hit midnight.\n\n“We always knew that this race would be close,” Warnock told supporters. “And so that's where we are.

She ran then on a campaign focused on crime, education and immigration policy, but her reelection was centered on economic issues.\n\nAfter a failed bid for U.S. Senate in 2020, Ronchetti framed his gubernatorial campaign around Grisham's track record, blaming Democrats for a faltering economy and specifically blaming the incumbent's policies for New Mexico’s rank as second in the nation for violent crime. Ronchetti also got a last-minute endorsement this month from former President Donald Trump.\n\nA third candidate, Libertarian Karen Bedonie, a mother of eight and citizen of the Navajo Nation, polled in the single digits throughout the race. She initially hoped to run on the Republican ticket, and is among those that have questioned the validity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n– Laura Bargfeld, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrats win in Hawaii Senate, governor’s races\n\nDemocrats easily won their races for the U.S. Senate and governorship in Hawaii.\n\nJosh Green overcame Republican challenger Duke Aiona for governor, while Sen.

Tim Ryan, whose campaign had a fundraising edge but lacked national party support, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe race has been one of the tightest in the country in recent polling and is a key test of the influence former President Donald Trump still wields. Trump endorsed Vance and went to Ohio to support him, telling rally goers in September that \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D. Vance.\"\n\nIt’s also a bellwether for which way national tides are turning on Election Day. The Senate seat has been occupied since 2011 by Republican Sen.

Hoyer Early Childhood Center \"radically\" different from what he was used to. But the Prince George's County polling place also offered two digital machines, so he chose to vote on one of those.\n\nHe said he feel it’s his duty to vote, and that he found the House and Senate races to be the most important. Outside of that there were some questions about bonds and borrowing money that drew his attention.\n\n“I’m fine with schools borrowing money,\" Aylin said. “I’m not fine with it for the government.”\n\n- Haley Smilow, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp reelected as Georgia governor\n\nRepublican incumbent Brian Kemp won the race for Georgia governor, defeating Democratic candidate and now two-time opponent Stacey Abrams, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe two faced off once before back in 2018, with Kemp narrowly claiming victory after a runoff election. This gubernatorial contest has been one of the most closely watched this midterm cycle as both candidates are major players in their parties.\n\nThe tightly fought race, along with Sen. Raphael Warnock’s bid to keep his seat in Congress, was expected to serve as a litmus test of just how strong the Democratic coalition in Georgia is and whether it can withstand an election largely viewed as a referendum on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have suffered throughout his second year.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBrian Kemp's win: 3 takeaways from the Georgia governor's race\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria unseated by Jennifer Kiggans\n\nRepublican state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans unseated incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., Tuesday in Virginia's 2nd District, which gained a more Republican tilt in redistricting but was still considered a toss-up.\n\nBoth Luria and Kiggans are Navy veterans who campaigned on promises to fight for defense and veterans issues.\n\nKiggans, who currently represents Legislative District 7 in the Tidewater region of the state, positioned herself as the candidate to restore American strength that she said has been injured by the policies of the Biden administration - policies she said Luria continually backed.\n\nLuria, a two-term House member, is also a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. A main thrust of her campaign was what she called Kiggans' failure to discuss her stance on results of the 2020 election.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nDoes early good news for Dems mean a red tsunami isn't materializing?\n\nTwo vulnerable House Democrats in Virginia swing districts appeared to be on their way to victories, perhaps signaling that a red tsunami many predicted isn’t materializing.\n\nCNN and NBC projected that U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Yesli Vega in the state’s 7th congressional district, a fiercely fought battleground, while Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., was the projected winner over Republican Hung Cha in the 10th congressional district.\n\n“I’m still waiting for the Red Wave to arrive,” veteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberger said on Twitter. “It may still come, but I have not seen it yet. That does not mean the Rs won’t win the House and Senate.”\n\nRepublicans picked up a third battleground seat in Virginia, however, with CNN projecting Jen Kiggans defeated Rep.

But Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman and the first Democrat elected to represent the 7th district since 1971, highlighted her bipartisan record throughout the campaign.\n\nVega, a first-generation Salvadoran-American and a one-term Prince William County supervisor, positioned herself as a check on the Biden administration. She got a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump last week, but did not actively embrace it.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley reelected to Senate seat\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley has defended his Iowa Senate seat against Democratic challenger Michael Franken, according to ABC and NBC.\n\nGrassley has served in office since 1959.

He is a former state representative who cast himself as someone willing to take the fight to the status quo.

Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., beat back Trump-endorsed Republican challenger Don Bolduc in a race that narrowed sharply in the final days despite the state being carried by President Joe Biden in 2020, according to ABC and NBC News\n\nHassan, who served as governor from 2013 until she entered the Senate in 2017, tried to distance herself from the president throughout her campaign. She criticized the administration for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year and for its handling of rising inflation.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army general, repeated false claims during the primary that the 2020 election was stolen, but he walked those back after securing the GOP nomination in September. In October, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stopped funding Bolduc’s campaign to prioritize other battleground states.\n\n– Ryan Knappenberger\n\nProgressive activist becomes first Gen Z-er to be elected to Congress\n\nA former March for Our Lives and ACLU activist, Maxwell Alejandro Frost, 25, won his election bid against Republican Army veteran Calvin Wimbish to represent Florida's 10th Congressional District, which includes the Orlando area.

Greg Abbott won reelection, besting former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who had sought to ride what he and other Democrats hoped would be a wave of registered Democratic voters to victory in the long deep-red state, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe race drew national attention for O'Rourke, who lost a bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and made a brief presidential run in 2020. O'Rourke's name recognition and charisma fueled Democratic hopes that he could win the governor's race.\n\nBut as of last week, Abbott was favored to win by nearly 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.

Election officials say the tabulation machines are certified by state and federal inspectors, which is required under the law.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's claims there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election have been roundly debunked.\n\n— Robert Anglen, The Arizona Republic\n\nOhio sets record for early voting\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced Ohio voters set a record this year for early voting in a nonpresidential election year.\n\nMore than 1.55 million Ohioans either voted early in-person or requested a mail-in absentee ballot for this election.\n\n“This is an increase of 3.9% over the previous record set in 2018,” according to the Secretary of State's office.

Abigail Spanberger is on the ballot against Republican Yesli Vega for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, the main issues include inflation and abortion.\n\nReba Gravelle, a 40-year resident of the Woodbridge area, said her candidate would have to support her views on abortion. “I’m a very pro-life person and so my candidate needed to support that,” she said.\n\nJoshua King, a veteran and current deputy sheriff, said health care brought him to the polls for Democrats. King also took into consideration his daughter, who has autism. “I support any candidate who decides that they want to help out our special needs community because they’re marginalized,” he said.\n\n– Kaila Nichols and Dante Nieto, Medill News Service\n\nIn Texas, Beto O'Rourke supporters argue with protesters over LGBTQ issues\n\nDemocrat Beto O’Rourke, who is challenging Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, held an Election Day meet-and-greet outside a public library in North Dallas this morning. While O’Rourke talked with a ring of supporters, far-right agitators jostled with onlookers and tried to disrupt the candidate’s speech, with little success.\n\nThe handful of anti-O’Rourke onlookers shouted statements about pedophilia and transgender rights that have become a refrain of the extremist right in Texas in recent months. Despite some high-spirited discussions with the candidate’s supporters, the hecklers were unable to push past them and get close to O’Rourke, who spoke to the crowd for about an hour.\n\nTransgender rights have become a political lightning rod in Texas, which has also seen a surge in protests and attacks on LGBTQ-friendly events such as family friendly drag shows. O’Rourke has been endorsed by several LGBTQ organizations, and has criticized Abbott for his support of policies that he says discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nBiden: 'MAGA Republicans' don’t care about Black communities\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden warned in an Election Day radio interview targeted at Black Americans that far-right “MAGA Republicans” don’t care about African-American communities.\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said on the “D.L. Hughley Show” when asked about his message to Black Americans who are still on the fence about voting.\n\nMAGA Republicans are “a different breed of cat,” Biden said in the interview, which was taped Tuesday morning. “They care about your community about as much as … well, anyway,” he said, without finishing the sentence. “You’ve seen what you’ve got from that community,” he added.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nNorth Carolina Senate race: Ted Budd supporters optimistic at polls\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – North Carolina has never elected a woman of color to the U.S. Senate, and many voters don't expect that to change Tuesday.\n\nSupporters of Democrat Cheri Beasley say they are not exactly confident, but some remain hopeful: \"Some of the underdogs come out on top!\" said Jannet Blue, 58, a Department of Motor Vehicles supervisor who voted in Winston-Salem.\n\nBackers of Republican Ted Budd are more confident; his poll lead has grown in recent weeks, and voters said it just feels like a Republican year in the Tar Heel State. \"We need to keep working people working,\" said James Wilcox, 61, a Winston-Salem businessman.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nArizona voting machines: Maricopa County resolves ballot tabulation issues at some locations\n\nThe Maricopa County Elections Department found a solution for tabulation issues that affected about 60 of the county’s 223 voting centers, the county government said Tuesday.\n\nPrinters at the locations were not producing dark enough timing marks on ballots, according to Maricopa County’s official Twitter. To resolve the issue, county technicians changed the printer settings. The solution has so far worked at 17 locations and technicians have been deployed to the remaining locations to resolve the issue, according to the county.\n\nStephen Richer, Maricopa County recorder, issued an apology to voters on his personal Twitter, promising that “every legal vote will be tabulated.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nPhiladelphia voting ‘going great’ so far\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Tuesday has been a “wonderful” day for voting in the city, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\n“It’s going great,” he told USA TODAY. “Nothing has risen to a level of concern.”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of voters have been able to cast ballots without incident and the processing has been “going smoothly,” Custodio said.\n\nPolls are open until 8 p.m. and voters can turn in mailed ballots until that time in Pennsylvania.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nFor some in New Hampshire, Biden’s stake in democracy gets through\n\nBEDFORD, N.H. – For some in New Hampshire, where presidential candidates flock every four years, President Joe Biden’s message that democracy is at stake resonated with some voters.\n\nJonathan French says it’s why he’s voting for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan over Republican Don Bolduc.\n\n“I believe in democracy. Don Bolduc denies the election results from 2020,” French simply put. But at the same time, French isn’t sure if he wants to see Biden run again in 2024. “We’ll wait and see,” said French.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMailed ballots drive higher turnout in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There is a higher turnout today and the bulk of the counting will be done tonight, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\nAbout 101,000 mailed ballots will be processed tonight, he told USA TODAY, with the first tally showing five minutes after the polls close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania. The counting will take “the normal amount of time,” meaning most of the results will be in tomorrow or Thursday, he said.\n\nCustodio is expecting a higher turnout in this election compared to 2018 because of mail-in voting, he said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhy one voter in Philadelphia is staying home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Standing outside a Save A Lot grocery store, Lori Dornan explains why she’s shopping after work instead of voting.\n\n“My vote will just give a politician more money and power.

Voters and children playing in the area were escorted into the voting room, he said, and the doors were shut.\n\nLibrary staff declined to comment on the incident. Police would not confirm whether a knife was involved, saying only that someone was taken into custody following a disturbance in which no one was injured. Voting at the library was disrupted for about 30 minutes, the poll worker said, but has since returned to normal operations.\n\n– Lawrence Andrea\n\nGet your 2022 live midterm election results here\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections are underway and American voters are hitting the polls to elect members of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as governors in certain states.\n\nFollow our live coverage for Senate results, House results and gubernatorial results begin to roll in.

Voting rights groups worry the tactic called “overvoting” could lower voter confidence and slow down counting.\n\n“We have seen a few loosely organized groups pushing for folks to purposely overvote their ballot to make sure their ballot is hand counted this cycle,” said Liz Wester, director of the New Hampshire Voter Empowerment Task Force, a voting rights group.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State, David Scanlan, told USA TODAY that the state is already prepared for hand counting; his office has sent more election workers to polling places to assist in counting ballots.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCommon Cause: Election glitches routine, with some 'weird' anecdotes in Ohio\n\nCatherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause of Ohio, said most questions about voting have been routine, with a couple of “weird” examples.\n\nA priest in Toledo was checking the identification of voters, Turcer said. In Summit County, around Akron, a man was visiting polling places and just watching before being asked to move along, she said.\n\nBut most voting problems reported nationwide were routine, such as problems with voting machines forcing longer lines, not systemic, said Sylvia Albert, Common Cause director of voting and elections.\n\n“What we’re seeing is really what we see in every election, isolated incidents of some problems,” Albert said. “No election is perfect. Election officials are doing their job.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFor some, Walker’s candidacy is about ‘grace and forgiveness’\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. – Former football player Herschel Walker’s personal controversies have made his Senate campaign a target for Democrats, but many Georgia voters think differently.\n\n“Herschel is real, he’s one of us,” voter Tricia Choi, 55, told USA TODAY. Choi said for many Walker's story is about the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, which she said appeals to faith-based voters.\n\nWalker, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife. Most recently, allegations surfaced that he pressured former girlfriends to have abortions, which he has denied.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMark Kelly, Blake Masters set for final pitch in Arizona Senate race\n\nOn one side is Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat and former astronaut whose wife was shot in the head by an angry constituent. On the other is Blake Masters, a tech investor and first-time candidate backed by a billionaire patron and endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe two are locked in what’s become an increasingly tight race, with Kelly’s initial advantage in the polls narrowing to a dead heat.\n\nWith hours to go until polling places close, Kelly planned to hit get-out-the-vote events in west Phoenix and Tucson. Masters planned to spend election night at the Arizona Republican Party’s watch event in Scottsdale.\n\nMaricopa County, where problems have been reported at one out of five polling sites, is home to Phoenix and is Arizona’s most populous county. It's also one of the largest in the nation – and while it has tended to vote for Republican candidates in recent years, Biden carried it in 2020.\n\nThe vote there will likely be critical to deciding the tossup Senate race.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, The Arizona Republic, Donovan Slack, and John Fritze\n\nSnowstorm greets voters in crucial swing county\n\nIt was a snowy Election Day in Washoe County, Nevada.\n\nThe county is crucial territory for Nevada – and the nation – as Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is fending off a challenge from Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt. The contest is among a handful that could determine who controls the Senate – and the fate of Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nMarc Picker, poll manager at Damonte Ranch High School, said turnout so far is among the highest he has seen despite the weather. One Democratic voter, Reno resident Margaret Smith, said few flakes wouldn't have kept her away.\n\n“I’m like the U.S. Postal Service – neither rain, sleet or snow will stop me from going out like Santa,” Smith said. “(Voting) is that important.”\n\nAnother Reno voter, Jim Lewis, agreed, despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum. “If they like their freedom and liberty, they should go out there and not be afraid,” he said.\n\n— Jason Hidalgo, Reno Gazette Journal, and Donovan Slack\n\nStocks rally on expectations of GOP inroads\n\nStocks rallied Tuesday on expectations that Republicans will retake at least one chamber of Congress, likely the House of Representatives. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 1.5% as of 1 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were also up by more than 1%.\n\nStocks tend to perform better when in a divided Congress gridlock since it can restrict government spending and hold up new legislation that can negatively impact stocks, analysts said.\n\n— Elisabeth Buchwald and Medora Lee\n\nMore debates is what some voters wanted\n\nAVONDALE ESTATES, Ga. — Coming out of his polling place in DeKalb County, voter Gregory Ewing said what was most aggravating during the 2022 midterms was the lack of debates.\n\nAs USA TODAY reported in September many candidates sought to avoid each other in some of the most high-profile races.\n\nEwing said Georgians deserved more chances to see a direct contrast between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker on stage in the final weeks of the race.\n\n“It’s hard to know what the truth is with these ads. The closest place we can get to the truth and how candidates really think is through a debate,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIllinois county reports election-related cyberattack, but voting not compromised, officials say\n\nChampaign County, Ill., is fighting off an election-related cyberattack that is unrelated to actual voting operations, according to officials there, who say connectivity issues and computer server performance are making it harder – but not impossible – for people to vote.\n\n“The Clerk’s Office believes these are due to cyber-attacks on the network and servers,” Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons said in a news release.\n\nChief Deputy Clerk Angie Patton told USA TODAY that the clerk’s office has been the target of repeated DDOS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks and that she believes other counties may have been targeted as well.\n\nBut she said IT specialists have secured the Clerk's website – and election operations – and that no data or information has been compromised and the election is secure. She urged voters waiting in long lines to either wait or go to another polling place within the county since voters can cast their ballots there as well.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nAt the top of the Texas ticket: Gov. Greg Abbott faces Beto O’Rourke\n\nTexans have their eye on the marquee race for governor: incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott runs against Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke caught the attention of the state and nation after running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018. Abbott is fighting for a third term.\n\nAbbott has led ahead of O’Rourke in Texas polls; margins sometimes reach single digits. On Oct. 30, a poll by the University of Texas at Tyler showed Abbott leading by 6 percentage points among likely voters. Another October poll by the University of Texas Politics Project showed Abbott leading by 11 points.\n\nO’Rourke seeks to galvanize voters around abortion access and gun legislation. O’Rourke’s final ad ahead of Election Day centered around his support for abortion access.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\nBiden spending Election Day at the White House\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is spending Election Day at the White House with no public events on his schedule.\n\nThe White House said he dropped in on a virtual phone bank by the Democratic National Committee to thank staff and volunteers and taped a radio interview targeted at Black Americans.\n\nThe president has already cast his midterm ballot. Accompanied by one of his granddaughters, a first-time voter, Biden voted in Wilmington, Delaware, on Oct. 29.\n\nBiden is expected to address the nation about the election results on Wednesday, though they are likely to be incomplete at that point.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump says he voted for DeSantis, hints again at presidential run\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he voted Tuesday morning for Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, while also dropping more hints that he’ll soon declare a third run for the White House, according to media reports.\n\nTrump spoke to the media after he cast his vote at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center on Tuesday morning, according to video posted by the local CBS news station CBS12. Former first lady Melania Trump joined him. \"No matter who you vote for, you have to vote,\" Trump told a sparse crowd outside the polling station.\n\nTrump also repeated that he’ll be making an announcement a week from today at his Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Palm Beach, though he didn't say about what. \"I think Tuesday will be a very exciting day for a lot of people,” Trump said, adding that, “The country has gotten very bad.

Karen Bass, a former state Assembly leader and Democrat who is backed by President Joe Biden, could become the first Black woman to hold the job. She faces developer Rick Caruso, a billionaire Republican turned Democrat, who has campaigned on a platform of change.\n\nThe winner fills the seat of embattled Democrat Eric Garcetti, whose nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India is stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe election comes just weeks after City Hall was embroiled in a racism scandal that led to the ouster of the City Council president and urgent calls for the resignation of two more members.

That's double the estimate the county provided earlier in the day.\n\n\"We’re doing what we can to get these back online. It’s not like both of the tabulators are having these issues. It may only be one (at a location),\" Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday morning during an impromptu news conference.\n\nMaricopa County has 223 voting centers.\n\nVoters at impacted sites have two options: to cast their ballot via a secure box to be counted later or to go vote at a different location. Elections Department spokesperson Megan Gilbertson said poll workers are best equipped to help voters ensure their ballot is successfully cast.\n\n“It’s important for voters to talk to the poll workers on site,” Gilbertson said.\n\n— Anne Ryman and Sasha Hupka\n\nVirginia voters can register today, then vote\n\nVirginia’s same-day voter registration law went into effect last month.

Voting numbers tell the story\n\nMiami-Dade County is one of the biggest and most coveted prizes for any statewide candidate in Florida, and Democrats have owned it for years.\n\nConsider the fact that Miami-Dade hasn’t voted for a Republican since 1988 and hasn’t backed a Republican governor since 2002. That may be changing this year. Early voting numbers as of Tuesday morning show Republicans holding a slight edge of almost 4,000 votes over Democrats.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, it would represent one of the most dramatic electoral turnarounds in Florida history and may solidify the Sunshine State as a red, Republican state moving forward.\n\n— Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO MIDTERMS:Voting rights, ballot access and key issues: A guide to midterm elections in your state\n\nDon Bolduc says he will accept Election 2022 results if he loses to Maggie Hassan\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc said Tuesday that his opponent, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, is out of touch in accusing him of being “extreme” and an “election-denier,” saying he will concede the election Tuesday if he loses.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, made those remarks after voting at the Stratham Memorial School in the town where he lives.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nVoting begins smoothly in contested Nevada Senate race\n\nAt the Desert Breeze Community Center outside Las Vegas, approximately 100 people waited in line as the polls opened at 7 a.m. Robert Streat, 73, was among the first to cast a ballot, a personal in-person voting tradition he said dates back decades.\n\nStreat said he opposes Biden's agenda and worries the country is changing too fast from the values he helped defend in Vietnam. He said he supported Republican candidates in the election.\n\n“This country is going to hell if we don’t change it. We’ve got too many people who hate it,\" he said. “We should control the government but we’ve lost it.”\n\nBut Jonathan Copeland, 55, said he worries that Republican control of the House and Senate would mean further erosion of abortion rights, which he supports. Copeland said he voted to help defend the seat of U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat in danger of losing to Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. A Laxalt victory would help flip the Senate to Republican control.\n\n\"What politician has the right to tell a woman what to do?\" Copeland said.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nElection watchdog Common Cause reports routine polling problems in battleground states\n\nCommon Cause officials reported during a 10 a.m. news conference routine problems with voting in battleground states, but urged voters who cast ballots by mail to track them and make sure they were counted.\n\nAmy Keith, program director for Common Cause in Florida, said more than 15,000 absentee ballots were flagged by Thursday for problems such as a missing signature. Voters have until Thursday at 5 p.m. to fix the problems, but with a tropical storm hurtling toward the state, Keith urged voters to vote move briskly.\n\nShe said 2.2 million voters voted early in person and another 2.5 million voted early by mail.\n\n“Floridians are coming out to have their voices heard,” Keith said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials see no attacks on election infrastructure yet\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials so far have seen no indications of direct attacks on election infrastructure across the United States in the early hours of mid-term voting Tuesday. But they remain on high alert to disinformation operations and efforts to sway voters’ opinions by nation-states such as Russia, China and Iran, a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters.\n\nThe senior CISA official said those three nations continue to use the election disinformation playbook they have in past elections, and that CISA will continue to support election officials nationwide to any risks that may arise because of them.\n\nIn the first of three election security media briefings scheduled for Tuesday, the official would not say whether such foreign disinformation efforts are worse than in past election cycles, but confirmed that CISA is especially on guard against Russian malign influence campaigns following yesterday’s claim by sanctioned Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that the Kremlin has meddled in U.S. elections and will continue to do so.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nNew Hampshire governor: Trump announcing 2024 run soon comes at 'worst time'\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican running for reelection, was one of the first in line to cast his ballot, and when asked about reports former President Donald Trump is expected to announce a 2024 presidential run, he said it seemed like poor timing.\n\n“Anyone who thinks it’s a smart idea to announce an election, a potential presidential bid, after (Tuesday’s) election but before Christmas, is just the worst time you could possibly do it,” Sununu said. “My sense is the former president needs better advisers if that’s really what his strategy’s going to be.”\n\nAs he has crisscrossed the country to campaign for Republican midterm candidates, Trump has increasingly hinted that he may launch a 2024 White House bid soon after the midterms.

Their anxious, angry mood helps explain why campaign appeals have mostly turned not on aspirational promises – on exploring space or ending poverty, say – but on ominous warnings about the dangers of supporting the other side.\n\n\"Probably not since even the Civil War (has there been) such a dire situation for our democracy as we are in the current day,\" said John Mark Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.\n\nLessons learned in the midterms include those on the importance of the economy and the emergence of the extremes, among others.

While polls show a tight race for the Senate seat, DeWine has had a wide lead over Whaley in many polls.\n\n— Micah Walker and Caren Bohan\n\nElection officials: Disrupt ‘at your peril’\n\nTop election officials in key states with tight contests are ready for potential disruptions as voters head to the polls – and the ballots are counted afterward.\n\nIn Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said her office is coordinating closely with law enforcement, deploying dozens of monitors to polling paces, and is prepared to eject poll workers who violate rules.\n\nIn Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his office set up a texting system for poll workers in 85 counties to report problems and has state patrol officers and the National Guard ready to provide security.\n\nIn Arizona, Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates said officials throughout the county are ready to respond and are closely coordinating with law enforcement to ensure balloting goes smoothly.\n\n“Our message has been very clear to those who would try and disrupt this election: They do it at their peril,” Gates told reporters at a recent briefing hosted by The Center for Election Innovation & Research. “We're going to respond very strongly to that.”\n\nOne of his biggest worries ar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/18/hybrid-coral-reefs-butterfly-petition-drawbridge-tragedy-news-around-states/50613275/", "title": "Hybrid coral reefs, butterfly petition: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAshland: A Florida college student exploring the Alabama wilderness with his girlfriend was fatally wounded during a shootout with a would-be robber who appeared to be living with others in the woods, authorities said. Adam Simjee, 22, was shot to death in the Talladega National Forest near Cheaha State Park on Sunday, the Clay County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. Yasmine Hider and Krystal Diane Pinkins were charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery, the statement said. Wounded several times during the confrontation, Hider was awaiting transfer to jail from a Birmingham hospital, where she underwent surgery for her wounds. Pinkins, 36, was jailed. Simjee and girlfriend Mikayla Paulus, 20, were driving on a National Forest Service road when Hider flagged them down and asked for help with her car, sheriff’s officials said. She then pulled out a gun and ordered them into the woods, they said. Simjee also pulled out a pistol and shot Hider several times, but he also was hit and died at the scene. Hider called out for help, and Pinkins emerged from the forest before fleeing, authorities said. Authorities using a dog tracking team and a state police helicopter found a camp where they saw Pinkins, whose 5-year-old son ran from the woods with a loaded shotgun as officers were arresting her, sheriff’s officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Two oil and gas companies have announced plans to invest $2.6 billion into developing a major oil field on Alaska’s North Slope. Australia-based Santos and Spain-based Repsol made the announcement, which was lauded by state political leaders, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Santos has a 51% stake in the Pikka project, and the company said Tuesday that its investment will be $1.3 billion. Santos last year acquired Oil Search of Papua New Guinea, which had been working to advance the project. Santos, in a statement, said the funds will cover the initial phase of development at the Pikka field, with 80,000 barrels of oil daily expected to begin flowing in 2026. If developed, the field on state land east of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could significantly boost the flow of oil through the trans-Alaska pipeline system. Development could also generate billions of dollars in state and local tax revenue, primarily through royalties to the state. Another major North Slope oil prospect, ConocoPhillips’ Willow project, has been delayed by litigation and a new environmental review. Alaska U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan lauded the plans for the Pikka project. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy said it “will continue the renaissance on Alaska’s North Slope.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An effort by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to use shipping containers to close a 1,000-foot gap in the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma suffered a brief setback when two stacked containers somehow toppled over. Claudia Ramos, a correspondent for the digital platform of Univision Noticias in Arizona, posted on her Twitter feed a photo she took Monday morning of the containers on their side. She said they fell on the U.S. side of the border. No witnesses have come forward to say what happened Sunday night. Ramos said contractors in the area told her they believed the containers may have been toppled by strong monsoon winds. But C.J. Karamargin, a Ducey spokesman, said he doubted that hypothesis, adding that even though the containers are empty, they weigh thousands of pounds. “It’s unlikely this was a weather event,” Karamargin said, suggesting that someone opposed to the wall was to blame. The stacked pair of containers were righted by early Monday morning. “Clearly we struck a nerve. They don’t like what we are doing, and they don’t want to keep the border open,” the spokesman said. “This happened before securing the containers to the ground. They will be bolted later and will be immovable.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Medical marijuana patients spent $23.3million in July at the state’s 38 dispensaries to take home 4,171 pounds of cannabis. Natural Relief Dispensary of Sherwood had the largest month, with 392 pounds sold, while The Releaf Center of Bentonville followed with 308 pounds. The Arkansas Department of Health reports 88,893 active patient cards. “Medical marijuana purchases increased by more than $1 million from June to July,” said Scott Hardin, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “An average of $751,720 was spent daily on medical marijuana purchases in July.” Since Jan. 1, 2022, patients have spent a total of $157.9 million to obtain 27,782 pounds from the state’s 38 dispensaries. Arkansas patients purchased 12,056 pounds of medical marijuana in April, May and June totaling $68.75 million. The state tax collection for the first three-month period of the year totaled $8.23 million, the state department reported. For the month of July, the state collected $2.6 million in tax form sales. Patients pay a 6.5% regular state sales tax on medical marijuana and a 4% privilege tax. Cultivators who sell their product to a dispensary only pay the 4% privilege tax.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Forecasts for more scorching heat and monsoon moisture brought calls for Californians to conserve electricity Wednesday, along with warnings that lightning, thunderstorm winds and parched vegetation were a recipe for wildfires. The heat wave was expected to be most extreme in the state’s interior, chiefly the Central Valley, where some locations hit 110 degrees Tuesday. The wildfire risk was focused on northern counties. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s power grid, called for voluntary electricity conservation from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. due to expectation of increased use of air conditioning and tightening power supplies. Late afternoon through early evening is the period when the grid is most stressed due to high demand while solar energy production is decreasing. Red flag warnings for fire danger were posted for the northern Coast Range, eastern Shasta County and the Mount Lassen area. The National Weather Service warned of the possibility of “abundant lightning” and erratic gusts from thunderstorms. “Lightning can create new fire starts and may combine with strong outflow winds to cause a fire to rapidly grow in size and intensity,” the weather service said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Tumble out of bed and stumble to your mailbox. Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is now available in Larimer County. The country music singer’s international children’s literacy program provides one free book a month to children until they turn 5 to help inspire an early love for reading. Parents in Larimer County can enroll their children in the program through the United Way of Larimer County. “People are really excited about the program,” said Allison Hines, United Way of Larimer County’s senior vice president of resource development. “This is a really great opportunity to get books in the hands of families that may not otherwise have access to them.” Any child qualifies for the program until their 5th birthday. In Larimer County alone, roughly 17,000 children are eligible. Since the program launched last week, over 2,000 people have registered their children for the program, Hines said. Officials hope to have 4,200 families signed up in the program’s first year.The Imagination Library is mostly funded through the Dollywood Foundation, supplemented by the Imagination Library of Colorado, which receives money from the state. The Dollywood Foundation selects the books and sends them directly to the child.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city is investing in public art, with two more artists now invited to paint murals downtown. It seems that 2022 has become the year for murals in Norwich with the murals on Market Street Garage and Castle Church. Now, two more are in the works. The Norwich Street Art Collective invited artists Carlitos Skills, whose legal name is Carlos Alexis Rivera Rivera, from Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and Golden, legal name Cristhian Saravia, of Miami, to town. Both of their murals are expected to be finished Thursday. Peter Helms, founder of the Norwich Street Art Collective, was inspired by the street art in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, once a blighted neighborhood but now a place where culture and business thrive. “A group of people decided that if they brought in art, that would inspire people and give them a sense of pride in their community and ultimately transform it economically,” Helms said. Norwich is in a unique position. While millions of people visit the nearby casinos every year, there hasn’t been enough of a draw to pull casino visitors into the city. An outdoor art museum may have the kind of pull needed, Helms said. As long as it was family-friendly, the artists could do anything they wanted, as tight restrictions are “not how you get the best art from artists.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Riverside community celebrated the completion of 74 mixed-income apartments Tuesday, bringing updated public housing as well as units designated for people with disabilities and special needs as part of a $100 million redevelopment project in the Wilmington neighborhood. Over 100 state, federal and local elected officials, community leaders and neighbors gathered outside the first phase of Imani Village, where units have been set aside to house seniors, veterans and individuals with disabilities, along with transitioning families out of outdated Wilmington Housing Authority apartments into newly built apartment homes with up to four bedrooms. This is the first of six phases of a “Purpose Built Community” redevelopment plan spearheaded by the nonprofit Reach Riverside. It will offer 59 affordable units as well as 15 market-rate apartments. The second phase, expected to be completed by the end of the year, will add another 50 affordable and 17 market-rate units, said Jennifer Lienhard, Reach Riverside’s director of marketing and communications. Announced in 2018, the multimillion-dollar project aims to build hundreds of public housing units as well as mixed-income and homeownership opportunities, revamp early education and health services at Kingswood Community Center, and add high school grades to the local EastSide Charter School.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Catholic school in Northeast D.C. is raising money to repair the damage after someone broke several concrete windowsills and knocked down a statue of the school’s namesake weeks before the first day of classes, WUSA-TV reports. St. Anthony Catholic School said three benches were also pulled out of the ground and damaged. According to a police report, an unknown suspect destroyed the school’s property overnight Aug. 11 and took the head off the statue. St. Anthony Catholic Principal Mike Thomasian discovered the damage Friday and said he was disappointed to see someone would target the school’s patron saint. “Hate crimes can happen in any house of worship, and Catholics are being attacked right now,” he said. “And I didn’t know how strongly I felt about that until it hit home.” The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident as a suspected hate crime. It is at least the third religious hate crime investigated by police this year. Then, St. Anthony was targeted again over the weekend, according to Thomasian. He said a custodian discovered the principal’s office had been ransacked, and two religious statues had been destroyed. Thomasian said the thief also took $1,400 that children had raised for a charity. A GoFundMe had raised more than $30,000 in donations as of Wednesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Scientists and students from the University of Miami dove into the dark waters a few miles off the shores of Miami this week as part of an effort to develop hybrid reefs. The team from the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science was on a mission to collect eggs and sperm from spawning staghorn coral, which they hope to use to fertilize other strains of staghorn corals in a lab. It’s all part of a $7.5 million federal grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to help address security threats to the military and civilian infrastructure along vulnerable coastal regions in Florida and the Caribbean. The Miami-based project seeks to protect coastal bases from damaging hurricane storm surge using hybrid reefs. “Our mission is to develop hybrid reefs that combine the wave-protection benefits of artificial structures with the ecological benefits of coral reefs,” said Andrew Baker, a professor and director of the Coral Reef Futures Lab at the Rosenstiel School. “We will be working on next-generation structural designs and concrete materials and integrating them with novel ecological engineering approaches to help foster the growth of corals on these structures.” They will also be testing new adaptive biology approaches to produce corals that are faster-growing and more resilient to a warming climate, he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Attorneys for the family of a woman killed by gunfire last year as sheriff’s deputies executed a search warrant at her cousin’s home are calling for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate, arguing the deadly raid echoes the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Shooting broke out within seconds after Camden County deputies knocked down the door of Varshan Brown’s darkened home in Woodbine, about 100 miles south of Savannah, just before 5 a.m. May 4, 2021. The officers had a warrant to search the house for drugs. Brown’s cousin, 37-year-old Latoya James, was killed by bullets as deputies and Brown fired guns at each other. Brown was wounded and later charged with crimes. Local prosecutors brought no charges against the deputies after concluding they were justified in using deadly force. Lawyers for James’ family say there are striking parallels between this case and the 2020 raid by police in Louisville, Kentucky, that left Taylor dead. In both cases, officers arrived in the middle of the night and forced their way into homes with little to no warning. And each involved a shootout that killed an unarmed Black woman. “Latoya James was innocent in all aspects of this case,” said Harry Daniels, an attorney for her family. “She was at her cousin’s house. She wasn’t a target of any investigation.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Warning of a tough flu season ahead, state health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated against influenza and COVID-19 alike, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State lawmakers who made it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling banning such obstacles must pay $321,000 in legal fees to the winning side after losing in the same court. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney on the State Board of Examiners on Tuesday approved paying the winning side’s legal fees set by the court in June. The court in March 2018 banned Idaho from automatically rejecting applications from transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. The court ruled the restriction violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. But lawmakers in 2020 approved a ban anyway, and Little signed the bill into law. The 2018 case was reopened, and Idaho lost again, resulting in the $321,000 legal bill. The state previously paid $75,000 after losing the initial case in 2018. The plaintiffs in the case were represented by Lambda Legal, which on its website describes itself as a national legal organization working to get full civil rights recognition for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV. The Board of Examiners typically sends such bills to the Constitutional Defense Council but instead sent the bill to the Legislature on Tuesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state’s first lady has again bested her husband in an Illinois State Fair tradition, with M.K. Pritzker outbidding Gov. J.B. Pritzker for the fair’s grand champion steer. The first lady’s $105,000 bid for the steer, King, also beat her own record from 2021, when she and the governor were again pitted against each other in the auction.\n\nIndiana\n\nFremont: Hundreds of fish found dead in a northeastern Indiana lake likely died from natural events tied to recent hot weather, state wildlife officials said. Fisheries biologists with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources visited Clear Lake on Aug. 4 after residents reported numerous dead fish in the lake near the Steuben County town of Fremont, The Journal Gazette reports. The DNR said an estimated 500 fish were found dead, including bluegill, crappie and bass, in the lake about 50 miles northeast of Fort Wayne. The state agency said Monday that natural events likely caused the fish to die and noted that heat, warm water and windless days can produce low levels of dissolved oxygen in lakes. “Without dissolved oxygen, fish are unable to breathe and can die rapidly and in large numbers,” the DNR said in a news release. DNR biologists will continue monitoring conditions at Clear Lake. While the public health threat is considered very low, the agency said people should use common sense when visiting natural waterways, especially during periods of hot weather.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A City Council member is countersuing two police officers who took the unusual step earlier this year of suing several people who participated in a 2020 protest following a Minneapolis officer’s killing of George Floyd. Councilwoman Indira Sheumaker’s countersuit says Officers Peter Wilson and Jeffrey George used excessive force and violated her civil rights when they arrested her during a protest July 1, 2020, outside the Iowa State Capitol. Sheumaker’s lawsuit also accuses the officers of filing a frivolous lawsuit against protesters. In June, Wilson and George sued Sheumaker and five other protesters, accusing them of assault and seeking monetary damages, including an unspecified amount in punitive damages. The protest was among demonstrations against racism and police brutality that erupted worldwide following Floyd’s killing. It began as a rally at the Iowa State Capitol to push for the restored voting rights to felons and turned violent as police led away arrested protesters. The officers’ lawsuit – which they filed as individuals and not as representatives of the Des Moines Police Department – accuses Sheumaker and another protester of putting George in a chokehold as protesters attempted to thwart the officers’ attempts to arrest several people on prior warrants.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Federal officials are expected next month to rename five creeks and a stream on federal land in the state because their names include a slur for Native American women. That word, “squaw,” was formally declared derogatory last November in an order issued by Deb Haaland, the nation’s first Native American Secretary of the Interior. The term is an ethnic, racial and sexist slur, particularly for Indigenous women, Haaland said in a news release. “Our nation’s lands and waters should be places to celebrate the outdoors and our shared cultural heritage – not to perpetuate the legacies of oppression,” she said. Haaland ordered the Board on Geographic Names, the federal body tasked with naming geographic places, to find replacement names for more than 660 geographic features bearing that term, including the six sites in Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State Parks has launched a photo contest that encourages visitors to capture some of the best parts of their stay. The contest aims to attract more travelers and showcase these “places of beauty, from scenic mountain views to tranquil beaches,” Kentucky Department of Parks Commissioner Russ Meyer said in a statement. Photos can be entered in the categories of camping, scenic, trails and park activities and will be judged on factors including originality and artistic composition, officials said. Photo submissions can be made through Oct. 31, and winners will be announced in December. A grand prize winner will receive a two-night cottage stay, a Canon camera and a $100 Kentucky State Parks gift card. Four honorable mention categories will have first- and second-place winners, who will receive camping certificates and gift cards.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: State law does not require that a candidate who mistakenly fills in the wrong address on a qualification form must be tossed off the ballot, a lawyer for Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins told the Louisiana Supreme Court on Tuesday. A lawsuit says Perkins did not use the address where he claims a homestead tax exemption when he signed up to run for reelection, as the law requires. He used another address for a residence he owns in the city. Perkins has acknowledged the mistake, and none of the seven justices Tuesday accused him of perjury. The case involves the question of whether “there are some things that a candidate does not have to tell the truth about,” Justice Jay McCallum said as he questioned Perkins’ attorney, Scott Bickford. Bickford said state law does not specifically call for disqualifying a candidate for using the wrong address. Jerry Harper, attorney for plaintiff Francis Deal, said the use of false information on the sign-up form for the Nov. 8 election – information the candidate swears to be true – disqualifies Perkins, who wants to run for a second term. Justice Scott Crichton at one point suggested that allowing Perkins on the ballot would be tantamount to nullifying the law. It was unclear when the justices would rule. So far, a district judge and an appellate court have ruled against Perkins.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to defrauding federal pandemic assistance programs of more than $300,000, which investigators say was spent on trucks, exercise equipment, a big-screen TV and laptop computers. Craig Franck, 40, of Levant, also used some of the relief money to post bail and hire a defense attorney after being charged with felony fraud in Florida, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and money laundering charges. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he’s sentenced. U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee vowed to go after those who “take advantage of a national emergency simply to line their own pockets.” Franck formerly owned CCF Acoustics LLC and CCF Acoustical Systems, but neither company was in business or had employees in 2020 and 2021 when he applied for federal assistance during the pandemic, prosecutors said. Franck received $177,400 from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program through the Small Business Administration and $145,060 from a private lender through the Paycheck Protection Program, prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge Lance Walker entered a forfeiture order Tuesday for about $320,000. Franck’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a telephone message seeking comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nCrofton: The family of a man fatally shot by a police officer filed a federal civil right lawsuit Monday against the department and individual officers. Dyonta Quarles Jr. was shot Jan. 30 when Anne Arundel County officers responded to his Crofton home after his mother called 911 saying her son wouldn’t let her leave, according to the Attorney General’s Office. Bodycam footage shows Quarles punching Officer J. Ricci. As officers handcuff Quarles, the video shows him bite Ricci and another officer deploy a stun gun. Ricci calls on colleagues to shoot Quarles, then fires himself. Quarles died, and Ricci was taken to a trauma center in serious condition, officials said. Mikel Quarles said at a news conference announcing the suit Monday that she was asking for help, and her son was killed, news outlets report. Attorneys for the family said part of the suit focuses on officers’ training. The officers weren’t properly trained “and reacted in a manner which was unconstitutional, unreasonable and excessive,” attorney Gregory Kulis said. The officers should have reduced tension, he said. “The police arrived with guns drawn,” Kulis said. “They were ready to go to battle.” The Attorney General’s Office said the case remains under investigation. County police declined comment but said Ricci is still recovering.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is seeking to ban fossil fuels from new building projects and major renovations, Mayor Michelle Wu announced Tuesday. The Democrat said the state’s largest city will take advantage of a key provision in the climate change bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker last week. That legislation, which is meant to bring the state closer to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, calls for a pilot project allowing 10 Massachusetts cities and towns to require new building projects be all-electric, with the exception of life sciences labs and health care facilities. Wu said the city will file a home rule petition with the Legislature to join the pilot. “Boston must lead by taking every possible step for climate action,” she said in a statement. “Boston’s participation will help deliver healthy, energy efficient spaces that save our residents and businesses on utilities costs and create local green jobs that will fuel our economy for decades.” Wu’s office said natural gas, oil and other fossil fuels used in buildings represent more than one-third of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. New York, Washington, D.C., and Seattle are among the major U.S. municipalities that have enacted similar bans, The Boston Globe reports.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Recent solar activity and weather conditions could give Michiganders the chance to view the northern lights through Friday night, according to the National Weather Service in Gaylord. The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are created when charged particles ejected by the sun collide with atoms and molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. These charged particles then emit light that viewers perceive as the aurora. The Upper Peninsula is known to offer great conditions to view night sky phenomena due to its latitude, but Lower Peninsula residents may also get the chance to witness the northern lights, as they’re predicted to be visible as far south as Ohio and Pennsylvania. To spot the northern lights, look for greenish streaks of light that move and change, unlike clouds, which move in one direction. For best visibility, avoid areas with light pollution, and try to gain an unobstructed view of the night sky. The aurora will be visible closer to the horizon and will appear higher up in the sky the farther north the viewer are located. Strong solar activity may interfere with electronic communications such as radio, cellphone, television and satellite signals.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Former Minneapolis police Officer Thomas Lane, who was sentenced to 21/ 2 years for violating George Floyd’s civil rights, will do his time at a low-security federal prison camp in Colorado. A court order Tuesday directs Lane to report to the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood in the Denver suburb of Littleton on Aug. 30. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson had recommended that the Bureau of Prisons send Lane to the low-security prison camp in Duluth, closer to his home, but the bureau makes the final decisions on where to place inmates, including weighing safety concerns. “He should be fine there,” said Lane’s defense attorney, Earl Gray. According to the Bureau of Prisons website, FCI Englewood is a low-security prison for men with an adjacent minimum security satellite camp. It holds 1,032 inmates, including 97 at the camp. Housing is dormitory or cubicle style. Life there is highly regimented, including frequent head counts and having to wake at dawn.\n\nMississippi\n\nLexington: Police have “terrorized” Black residents in a small town by subjecting them to false arrests, excessive force and intimidation, according to a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday by a civil rights organization. The group, JULIAN, is seeking a temporary restraining order against the Lexington Police Department to demand protection for the town’s largely Black population. Lexington is about 63 miles north of the capital, Jackson. “It’s both unconscionable and illegal for Lexington residents to be terrorized and live in fear of the police department whose job is to protect them,” said Jill Collen Jefferson, president and founder of JULIAN. “We need both the courts and the Department of Justice to step in immediately.” The town’s city attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The town’s interim police chief, Charles Henderson, cast doubt on many of the allegations in response to an email request for comment. “I’m working on moving the Lexington Police Department forward,” he said. “I will say, don’t buy into everything you hear. This is defamation of character.” The lawsuit comes after JULIAN said it obtained an audio recording in July of then-Lexington Police Chief Sam Dobbins using racial slurs and talking about how many people he had killed in the line of duty.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: As the U.S. government expands incentives for renewable energy, a decision by the Missouri Supreme Court is moving the state in the opposite direction by halting a solar energy tax break that has been on the books for nearly a decade. The high court struck down a 2013 state law granting a property tax exemption for certain solar energy systems, saying the tax break wasn’t allowed under the state constitution. The case involved a privately run solar farm supplying energy for City Utilities of Springfield, which serves Missouri’s third-largest city. As a result of the ruling, the company owning the solar energy farm will owe at least $423,360 in property taxes from 2017 to 2020, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said. It’s not clear how many other solar energy sites across Missouri could be affected by the ruling or exactly how much tax revenue is at stake. But the ruling could have a chilling effect on solar energy development in Missouri, just as the federal government is trying to encourage it. “This obviously would put a big kink and cost in the way of someone trying to lay out a large panel system, if you’ve got to pay taxes on the material generating this renewable, free energy,” said Jon Dolan, executive director of the Missouri Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs can be held responsible for damages awarded to a woman who became pregnant after an on-duty BIA officer used the threat of criminal charges to coerce her into having sex, the Montana Supreme Court has ruled. The woman, identified by the initials L.B. in court documents, sued former BIA officer Dana Bullcoming and his employer for the October 2015 sexual assault on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation that resulted in the birth of a child, who is now 7, said her attorney, John Heenan. “This is a woman that had the courage to report a federal law enforcement officer for sexually assaulting her and then had the courage to go through the entire process, including agents there to collect DNA when the child was born,” Heenan said Wednesday. She pursued the case on behalf of people living on reservations to show “that they should have the same rights as Montanans do on this issue.” U.S. District Judge Susan Watters of Billings awarded the woman $1.6 million in damages in May 2020 but had ruled earlier that the BIA could not be held responsible for paying them because under federal law, the coercion and sex were outside the scope of Bullcoming’s duties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The special board appointed by President Joe Biden to intervene in stalled railroad contract talks suggested Tuesday that 115,000 rail workers should get 24% raises and thousands of dollars in bonuses as part of a new agreement to avert a strike. Railroads and unions will use those recommendations as the basis for a new round of negotiations over the next month. It remains to be seen, however, whether railroads will agree to the higher wages or find ways to address union concerns about working conditions. If the two sides can’t agree on a new deal by mid-September, federal law would allow a strike or lockout. But Congress is likely to intervene before then to keep the supply chain moving. A railroad strike could devastate businesses that rely on Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and other major freight railroads to deliver raw materials and ship their products. In past national rail labor disputes, lawmakers have voted to impose terms on the railroads before workers could strike. A White House official said Biden is optimistic the report will provide a good framework for successful negotiations because avoiding a rail shutdown is in the nation’s interests.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists who are already suing to block a geothermal power plant where an endangered toad lives in western Nevada are now seeking U.S. protection for a rare butterfly at another geothermal project the developer plans near the Oregon line. The Center for Biological Diversity is petitioning the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the bleached sandhill skipper under the Endangered Species Act at the only place it’s known to exist. It says the project the Bureau of Land Management approved last year 250 miles north of Reno could ultimately lead to the extinction of the 2-inch-long butterfly with golden-orange wings. “This beautiful little butterfly has evolved over millennia to thrive in this one specific spot, and no one should have the right to just wipe it off the face of the Earth,” said Jess Tyler, a scientist at the center who co-wrote the petition. USFWS has 90 days to decide whether there’s enough evidence to conduct a yearlong review to determine if protection is warranted, so any formal listing is likely years away. But the petition signals the potential for another legal fight all too familiar to Ormat Nevada, which wants to tap hot water beneath the earth to generate carbon-free energy the Biden administration has made a key part of its effort to combat climate change with a shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A hermit known as River Dave – whose cabin in the New Hampshire woods burned down after he had spent nearly three decades on the property and was ordered to leave – has found a new home in Maine. David Lidstone, 82, has put in windows and is working on installing a chimney on his rustic three-room cabin, which he said is on land he bought. “The foundation needs repair work,” Lidstone, who received more than $200,000 in donations following the fire, said in a phone interview Monday. “It’s just an old camp, but I enjoy working (on it).” Lidstone, who grew up in Maine, declined to say where he was living or provide a contact for the landowner. A search of Maine county registers of deeds did not show any recent transactions involving Lidstone, but a cousin confirmed he had moved to Maine, and a Facebook post had photos of Lidstone with a family member in his new home. “He’s working on putting it together and clearing land and planting gardens, and he’s got some chickens. He’s moving on,” said Horace Clark, of Vermont, Lidstone’s cousin. Lidstone said he had to leave Canterbury, New Hampshire, over his dispute with a different landowner since 2016 over a patch of forest near the Merrimack River that Lidstone called home for 27 years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s casinos, horse tracks that offer sports betting, and the online partners of both types of gambling outlets won $480.7 million in July, an increase of 6.7% from a year ago. But some of Atlantic City’s nine casinos continue to struggle to return to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the amount won from in-person gamblers, with five of them individually winning less in July 2022 than they did in July 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic began. Figures released Tuesday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show that the casinos collectively won just under $299 million from in-person gamblers. That’s more than the $277 million they collectively won in July 2019. But five casinos – Bally’s, Borgata, Golden Nugget, Harrah’s and the Tropicana – won less from in-person gamblers last month than they did in July 2019. Nonetheless, Atlantic City’s performance in July “showed indications of a strong summer season fueled by a return to normal operations and consumer behavior,” said Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University. James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said the resort is off to a good start to the crucial summer season.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: A fundraiser organized by a local LGBTQ organization at a brewery in Aztec was canceled after the owners of the business reportedly received threats. Nicole Hall, board president of Identity Inc., the Farmington-based nonprofit that was organizing the Aug. 12 fundraiser, said she received a call from one of the owners of the 550 Brewing Taproom two days prior saying the business had received several threats from people apparently upset about the all-ages event including a drag show. The Back to School Bash planned by Identity Inc. at the brewery was intended to raise cash and draw donations of school supplies for children and teachers, according to a flyer for the event posted on the organization’s Facebook page. It included a $5 cover charge and featured a drag show, an open mic session, games and more. But Hall said the brewery owner said she and other business representatives had been contacted through various means by people upset by the prospect of children being present for the drag show. Some reportedly threatened the owners and members of their family, Hall said she was told. “My immediate response was, ‘I’m so sorry people are being hateful to you. We’re used to it, but I didn’t think it would boil over to you and your family,’ ” Hall said she told the brewery’s owners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities say they have busted an organized crime racket reminiscent of the Mafia’s heyday, involving illegal gambling parlors in New York City and Long Island and a police detective accused of helping to protect the lucrative schemes. Two indictments unsealed Tuesday charged nine people, including the detective, with crimes such as racketeering, illegal gambling, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Nicknames of the defendants included “Joe Fish,” “Sal the Shoemaker” and “Joe Box.” The top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn said the racketeers operated from fronts including a coffee bar, a soccer club and a shoe repair shop. “Today’s arrests of members from two La Cosa Nostra crime families demonstrate that the Mafia continues to pollute our communities with illegal gambling, extortion and violence while using our financial system in service to their criminal schemes,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said. He called the detective’s alleged conduct “shameful.” The Nassau County Police Department detective, Hector Rosario, is accused of accepting money from the Bonanno crime family in exchange for steering police raids toward competing gambling clubs.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Although illegal marijuana and lawful hemp look and smell the same, criminal prosecution for pot can still be legitimate when sight or odor contributes to a warrantless search and seizure, the state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday. A three-judge panel found no errors related to a trial judge or attorney for Derek Edwin Highsmith, who was convicted last year of felony marijuana possession stemming from a Duplin County traffic stop in 2017. He was sentenced to a maximum of a little over four years in prison. Highsmith argued unsuccessfully at a hearing before his trial that the evidence collected after a K-9 alerted officers to possible drugs inside the vehicle should have been suppressed because it was unlawfully obtained. Superior Court Judge Henry Stevens IV denied Highsmith’s suppression motion, saying the K-9’s positive alert for narcotics, along with other factors, provided officers with the facts to find probable cause to conduct the search. The prosecutor called ït a “K-9 sniff-plus case,” Tuesday’s opinion said. Sheriff’s officers said it saw a vehicle that left a residence after many complaints about narcotics sales there, according to the opinion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The city’s school board will reconsider its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at each of its meetings, after the move drew widespread criticism and threats of retaliation from some conservative state lawmakers. Fargo Board of Education President Tracie Newman told board members in a memo that she believes the pledge should be reinstated because the onslaught of “negative local and national feedback” could cost time and resources ahead of the new school year. She called a special meeting for Thursday. The Fargo board voted 7-2 last week to nix a previous board edict from April to recite the pledge before each meeting. The board includes four newcomers from the June election. In deciding against reciting the pledge, the board said the move didn’t align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code, largely because it says “under God” in one phrase. Robin Nelson, one of two board members to vote against dropping the pledge, said no one complained after the panel started reciting the patriotic vow. But since last week’s vote, the board has received “hundreds and hundreds of local and national emails and phone calls,” she said. She has heard personally from state lawmakers who have threatened to get even.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A federal judge awarded $650 million in damages Wednesday to two Ohio counties that won a landmark lawsuit against national pharmacy chains CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, claiming the way they distributed opioids to customers caused severe harm to communities and created a public nuisance. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said in the ruling that the money will be used to abate a continuing opioid crisis in Lake and Trumbull counties, outside Cleveland. Attorneys for the counties put the total price tag at $3 billion for the damage done to the counties. Lake County is to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County is to receive $344 million over the same period. Polster ordered the companies to immediately pay nearly $87 million to cover the first two years of the abatement plan. In his ruling, Polster admonished the three companies, saying they “squandered the opportunity to present a meaningful plan to abate the nuisance” after a trial that considered what damages they might owe. CVS, Walmart and Walgreens said they will appeal the ruling.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state lawmaker has filed an Open Records Act lawsuit seeking records about expenditures from Governor’s Emergency Education Relief funds. Republican state Rep. Logan Phillips filed the lawsuit Tuesday against the Office of Management and Enterprise Services and said Gov. Kevin Stitt and Education Secretary Ryan Walters, also both Republicans, have not responded to his requests for the documents. “I am seeking declarative and injunctive relief because I believe failure to provide the requested records is unlawful, and the records need to be made publicly available,” Phillips said. Stitt and OMES representatives told the Tulsa World that Phillips failed to attend scheduled meetings to see the documents. A U.S. Department of Education audit in July sharply criticized state officials for lack of oversight and accountability in how they used nearly $40 million in coronavirus relief funds intended for education. The audit recommended the state return nearly $653,000 spent on non-educational items such as televisions and Xbox gaming systems and audit another $5.4 million for possible refund of misspent funds. The state blamed the Florida-based contractor hired to administer the programs and sued the company for how it distributed the funds.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregon’s gubernatorial election took a step closer Tuesday to being a three-way race when unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson delivered thousands of voter signatures to get on the ballot. If the signatures are verified by election officials, the former state lawmaker will face Democratic nominee Tina Kotek, who is a former Oregon House speaker; and Republican nominee Christine Drazan, a former leader of the minority GOP in the House. “Coming onto the ballot through the power of people’s signatures is one of the most meaningful and foundational elements of my campaign,” Johnson said. She and several supporters delivered boxes of signature sheets to election officials in Salem. Johnson’s campaign said it delivered 48,214 signatures to Secretary of State Shemia Fagan’s election officials. Officials need to verify 23,744 of them as valid by Aug. 30 for Johnson to qualify for the November ballot. Tuesday was the deadline to deliver the signatures. “By delivering more than twice the number of signatures needed, we’ve made it very difficult for the political establishment to imagine ways to keep me off the ballot,” Johnson said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Two former judges who orchestrated a scheme to send children to for-profit jails in exchange for kickbacks were ordered to pay more than $200 million to hundreds of people they victimized in one of the worst judicial scandals in U.S. history. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner awarded $106 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages to nearly 300 people in a long-running civil suit against the judges, writing the plaintiffs are “the tragic human casualties of a scandal of epic proportions.” In what came to be known as the kids-for-cash scandal, Mark Ciavarella and another judge, Michael Conahan, shut down a county-run juvenile detention center and accepted $2.8 million in illegal payments from the builder and co-owner of two for-profit lockups. Ciavarella, who presided over juvenile court, pushed a zero-tolerance policy that guaranteed large numbers of kids would be sent to PA Child Care and its sister facility, Western PA Child Care. Ciavarella ordered children as young as 8 to detention, many of them first-time offenders deemed delinquent for petty theft, jaywalking, truancy, smoking on school grounds and other minor infractions. The judge often ordered youths he had found delinquent to be immediately shackled, handcuffed and taken away without giving them a chance to put up a defense or even say goodbye to their families.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A group of police officers put on body cameras Tuesday as part of a two-month pilot program that’s expected to pave the way for all the department’s patrol officers to wear them. Sixteen Warwick officers wore the Axon body cameras, which officers are now wearing on all three of the department’s patrol shifts. “This pilot program is really us getting our feet wet,” said Warwick’s police chief, Col. Brad Connor. The camera tryout in Warwick evokes a buzz of activity at police departments across the state as many local police officers get ready to do their jobs, day in and day out, with body cameras. A 30-day public comment period for a set of proposed rules and regulations runs out Friday. The draft policy was developed by the office of Attorney General Peter F. Neronha and the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety with guidance from the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association. Under the program, which is based largely on legislation passed last year, the draft policy can be approved following consideration of public input. The approved policy would govern the use of body cameras by police departments that tap into $15 million in funding that has been allocated by the state legislature.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh say prosecutors are taking too long to share their evidence alleging the disbarred attorney killed his wife and son, unfairly making it tougher to defend him at his upcoming trial. It’s a technical legal dispute that precedes many trials, but because of overwhelming public attention on Murdaugh’s case, attorney Dick Harpootlian called a news conference Wednesday that drew a dozen cameras at which he declared prosecutors want a “trial by ambush.” Prosecutors shot back. “This manufactured drama is just a well-known part of defense counsel’s playbook,” the state Attorney General’s Office responded in legal papers. Murdaugh, 54, was indicted in July on murder charges in the shooting deaths of his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, who were killed June 7, 2021, at one of the family’s homes in Colleton County. He has adamantly denied killing them. Murdaugh’s lawyers immediately asked for the prosecution’s evidence, and court rules require authorities turn it over in 30 days. That deadline was Monday, and defense lawyers said prosecutors didn’t provide the evidence because they wanted a judge to decide whether to require a protective order limiting to whom the defense can show the evidence and how it handles documents, photos and recordings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., has introduced a bill that would prevent foreign powers like China from buying U.S. agricultural land, according to a press release. The bill plays off the PASS Act introduced on the House side in July by Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and co-sponsored by Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. The Senate bill would amend the 1950 Defense Production Act to allow for the review of agricultural transactions, according to the bill’s language. The difference between Rounds’ bill and the Promoting Agriculture Safeguards and Security Act includes prohibiting China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from investing in agricultural land, as well as requiring the U.S. secretary of agriculture to report on the risk of foreign takeovers and investments in agricultural companies or land use for ag purposes. “Protecting American farmland is critical to maintaining our national security,” Rounds said. “In my travels around South Dakota, I’ve heard from many farmers and ranchers who are concerned about foreign adversaries owning American farmland.” More than 350,000 acres of farmland in South Dakota belong to foreign businesses, despite a 1979 law barring non-resident foreigners from owning more than 160 acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two Black men who challenged their criminal convictions after jurors deliberated in a courthouse room containing Confederate symbols have received opposite rulings from different judges on the same appeals court. One was granted a new trial. The other was denied. The conflicting decisions likely mean the matter will be appealed up to the Tennessee Supreme Court to sort out the discrepancy. The rulings from two three-judge panels of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals center on trials held at the Giles County Courthouse, putting jurors in a room adorned with items maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, including an antique Confederate flag and portraits of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. John C. Brown. In June, a state commission approved plans to move the artifacts to a museum. This week, a panel of judges ruled unanimously against a new trial for Barry Jamal Martin, who went to trial in February 2020 and was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The ruling says none of the jurors testified to “even noticing or being aware that the memorabilia was in the room.” The decision also questioned whether an average person would be able to recognize who was in the portraits or what the flag meant.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: Just months after an armed teenager entered Robb Elementary and killed two teachers and 19 children, a summer of conflicting government narratives has set parents on edge, particularly after a state report showed that 376 law enforcement officers showed up at Robb on May 24 but did not engage the shooter for more than an hour. Parents are now trying to plan for the back-to-school season and facing tough choices about their children’s education and safety. Some are keeping their kids in the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District when school starts Sept. 6, the Texas Tribune reports. Some are choosing home-schooling, and others are looking at private schools. At Uvalde High School’s auditorium this past week, district officials laid out for parents new safety measures and increased access to mental health resources for the upcoming school year. Superintendent Hal Harrell discussed the district’s partnership with Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine, which helps identify behavioral health needs of children and adolescents. The district is also contracting Rhithm, a company with an app that allows staff and students to log how they are feeling. Communities in Schools, a nonprofit focused on connecting students with resources, is also sending teams to the district to provide additional behavioral health support to students.\n\nUtah\n\nSanta Clara: A 12-year-old Little League World Series player was in critical condition Tuesday with what his family said was a head injury suffered when he fell off the top bunk of his bed at a dormitory complex. Easton Oliverson is a pitcher and outfielder for the Snow Canyon team out of Santa Clara. The Little League World Series began Wednesday in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. His dad, Jace Oliverson, is an assistant coach on the team. “I’ve always been a firm believer of prayer and the power that comes with it, and I feel like if people continue to rally around us that he will make a full recovery,” Oliverson told KSL-TV. “Right now it’s slow. They keep telling me it’s a cross-country race.” Oliverson gave an update on his son’s condition through Facebook and said doctors told him his son had punctured an artery, which caused bleeding on the brain and required the removal of a piece of skull. Snow Canyon Little League started an online store to support the team while in Williamsport. Now, proceeds from the fundraising will go toward Easton’s recovery. Snow Canyon is the first team from Utah to advance to the Little League World Series by winning the Mountain Region. The Santa Clara-based club plays its first game Friday at 1 p.m. and will face the winner of the New England vs. Southeast game.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A city police officer is on leave after he shot a man in the leg who was having an apparent mental health crisis Saturday afternoon, according to a news release from the Vermont State Police. David Johnson, 20, is still in the hospital, and no information has been shared by police about his condition. Sgt. Simon Bombard, who has worked for the Burlington Police Department for seven years, is on procedural administrative leave. Three police officers responded to a call just before 3 p.m. and found Johnson with a large kitchen knife standing outside the house and threatening suicide, according to the state police. The officers reportedly attempted to speak with Johnson, whom they knew from previous interactions, and de-escalate the situation. After about four minutes, Johnson reportedly charged one of the officers. The officer used an electroshock weapon on him, but it did not stop Johnson, according to the state police investigation. Another officer, whom state police have identified as Bombard, shot Johnson once in the upper left leg. The officer’s bullets also hit nearby occupied cars, and one person suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Johnson is expected to face charges, police said.\n\nVirginia\n\nMontpelier Station: The U.S. Postal Service has closed a small post office over agency management’s concerns about its location inside a historic train depot that also serves as a museum about racial segregation. In a statement this week addressing the closure, the USPS noted that the museum near former President James Madison’s Montpelier estate has historical signage above two exterior doors, one labeled “WHITE” and another labeled “COLORED.” It added that “Postal Service management considered that some customers may associate the racially-based, segregated entrances with the current operations of the Post Office and thereby draw negative associations between those operations and the painful legacy of discrimination and segregation.” The statement said operations were being suspended at the Montpelier Station Post Office with the intention of finding suitable alternative quarters in the community or, in the absence of any, proceeding with a study of whether to discontinue the branch. The post office location had one employee and operated four hours daily, according to the statement. It served about 100 people and closed in June, according to the Culpeper Star-Exponent.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state’s apple crop is forecast to be a bit smaller this year because of the cool spring. The Washington State Tree Fruit Association projected this week that the 2022 fresh apple crop will total 108.7 million 40-pound boxes. That’s an 11.1% decrease from 2021’s 122.3 million boxes. “We are pleased with the size of the harvest, particularly in the face of a long, cold spring,” WSTFA President Jon DeVaney said. The estimate shows that five popular apple varieties make up the majority of the harvest. Gala leads production at 20%, and Red Delicious and Honeycrisp are each projected at 14%, followed by Granny Smith at 13.4% and Fuji at 12.7% of total production. Cosmic Crisp, which is grown only in Washington state, is 4.6% of the harvest, up from 3.2% last year. Washington apples are sold in over 40 countries and are the state’s top farm commodity, representing 20% of the state’s farm-gate agricultural value in 2020. On average, 30% of the harvest is exported.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials in one county hit by flooding this week are starting the task of removing residential debris. Curbside debris collection began Wednesday in flood-ravaged neighborhoods of eastern Kanawha County where up to 5 inches of rain fell Monday, the county commission said in a news release. Among the hardest-hit areas were Hughes Creek, Kelleys Creek and Campbells Creek. The statement said dump trucks will collect debris through at least Sunday. The cleanup comes as forecasters predict another rainy stretch of weather starting Saturday. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice declared a state of emergency in Kanawha and Fayette counties, enabling the National Guard to respond to hard-hit areas. Some people had to be rescued by boat as the flooding damaged more than 100 homes, bridges and roads, interrupted drinking water systems and left more than 2,000 customers without electricity. Along the Fayette-Kanawha county line, several feet of mud made roads impassible in the Smithers area. The state Department of Environmental Protection on Wednesday issued an advisory against the recreational use of a 10-mile area downstream of the Mount Olive Correctional Center to the London Locks and Dam.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A man vacationing in the city fell to his death after a drawbridge was raised while he was walking across it. Richard Dujardin, 77, of Providence, Rhode Island, was crossing the Kilbourn Avenue Bridge in downtown Milwaukee on Monday afternoon with his wife, according to a Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office report. Rosemarie Dujardin made it across the bridge, which spans the Milwaukee River, but her husband was about halfway across when it began to open. He grabbed onto a side rail as the bridge sections rose to a 90-degree angle, but he lost his grip and fell about 70 feet to the pavement below, the report says. He suffered a head wound and was pronounced dead at the scene, investigators said. The bridge is controlled by the city’s Department of Public Works, and its two halves are raised and lowered for boat traffic by someone working remotely who has two camera views of the span. The lights and bells were operational as the two sections were raised, and crossing arms came down at each end of the bridge, according to investigators. Interim Public Works Commissioner Jerrel Kruschke said the employee who operated the bridge is in his fourth year and has conducted hundreds of bridge openings. He said the employee has been put on leave and offered counseling.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon has a clear path to reelection after winning the Republican primary Tuesday, while state Rep. Chuck Gray won the GOP primary for secretary of state. Megan Degenfelder defeated incumbent Brian Schroeder in the GOP primary for state superintendent of public instruction. Democrats, meanwhile, have all but ceded these offices to Republicans, fielding just two candidates who don’t even have websites for governor and just one candidate for state superintendent. Gordon had faced fierce opposition within the GOP for public health measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, causing speculation he’d face a tough primary challenge. He didn’t, after lifting a statewide mask mandate and other coronavirus restrictions. Last year, Gordon urged the National Rifle Association to move its headquarters from Virginia to Wyoming. In March, he signed a ban on most abortions that briefly took effect a month after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and is now on hold pending a lawsuit contesting the ban. Both moves helped buttress Gordon’s right-wing credentials. And while Gordon hasn’t gone out of his way to praise Donald Trump, neither has he criticized the ex-president’s fixation on the false belief that fraud cost him reelection in 2020. Gordon on Tuesday defeated Brent Bien, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel who oversaw operations in Guam.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/02/raven-story-stamp-willie-nelson-hells-angels-news-around-states/117772976/", "title": "Raven Story stamp, Willie Nelson: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A dive bar known to two generations of University of Alabama students, football fans and music lovers has ended its run. Egan’s Bar shut down over the weekend after 42 years in Tuscaloosa on a stretch of nightspots and restaurants called “The Strip.” A “Last Call at Egan’s” event was held Saturday, with Sunday the final day in operation. Owner Mike McWhirter said he’s selling Egan’s and plans to move to Texas for a job opportunity with his son. Another bar, Unique, will open at the same location this month. McWhirter, a longtime regular who took over the popular bar in 2018, said he made the hard decision to sell Egan’s within the past month, and the decision to close was tough. “To see that era end is a little difficult, and I’ve had my reservations, but being with my family is incredibly important to me,” McWhirter said. Bands including the Grammy-winning Alabama Shakes have played at Egan’s. It’s unclear what will become of a well-known sign that hangs over the door that reads: “Thick Smoke. Dim Lights. Loud Music. Welcome to Egan’s.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Alaska Native artist Rico Worl has created a stamp for the U.S. Postal Service that he hopes will be a gateway for people to learn about his Tlingit culture. A ceremony marking the release of Worl’s Raven Story stamp was held Friday in Juneau, where Worl lives. The event featured dancers, including Worl, and the telling of a version of the Raven story. Two ravens, birds that are ubiquitous in Juneau, happened to fly overhead after the story was told. Worl said his Twitter following exploded from five to more than 8,000 after he shared the Postal Service’s tweet highlighting the stamp announcement last month, with his own quote tweet adding: “I did a thing.” Raven, a trickster or transformer, is a key figure in Tlingit culture. Worl described as an influence for the stamp a story in which Raven discovers that a clan leader had in his possession the sun, moon and stars. Raven assumed human form to share those items with the world. The stars were in the last box Raven opened. In a statement, Worl said he wanted to showcase “a bit of drama,” with Raven trying to hold onto as many stars as possible while transforming back into bird form during a frenzied escape. The Sealaska Heritage Institute, which hosted the unveiling in front of its building, said this is the first stamp by a Tlingit artist.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state on Saturday reported more than 2,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 infections for the first time in nearly five months amid a continuing increase in its rolling average of new cases and more coronavirus-related hospitalizations. “Unlike last summer when we were headed into school w/ declining rates, the match has been lit and the kindling is aflame this time,” Dr. Joe K. Gerald, a University of Arizona researcher who tracks COVID-19 data, said on Twitter. In another development, a Republican legislator who supported a measure enacted in late June to prohibit school districts from requiring mask-wearing, said she has asked government lawyers to determine when the prohibition takes effect. Sen. Kelly Townsend’s requests Friday to the Legislature’s legal office and the state Attorney General’s Office was a response to Phoenix Union High School District’s announcement that it will require students, staff and visitors to wear masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. The prohibition in budget legislation is retroactive to July 1, but the budget legislation itself doesn’t take effect until Sept. 29. “It is clear we still have an issue with rogue school boards when it comes to forcing masks,” Townsend said in a statement. District officials said they were most concerned about protecting health and safety.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The superintendent of the city’s schools on Friday called for suing to overturn the state’s ban on mask mandates, saying he wasn’t confident legislators would allow local school boards to impose their own requirements. Superintendent Mike Poore said he’ll ask the Little Rock School Board to challenge the state law prohibiting state and local government entities from requiring masks. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who signed the ban in April, said Thursday that he’ll call the majority-GOP Legislature back into session this week to lift the ban for K-12 public schools. Hutchinson and legislative leaders have said they face an uphill battle in changing the law, especially since it would need two-thirds support in the House and Senate to take effect before school begins. “I’m not confident that will occur,” Poore said in a YouTube video released by the district. “This lawsuit allows us a place in order to take this situation to the judicial branch and act on (the ban).” If approved, Little Rock’s lawsuit would be among at least two expected in the coming weeks challenging Arkansas’ ban as the school year approaches. A group of parents is also expected to file a lawsuit challenging the ban’s constitutionality.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The FBI is investigating what one commercial airline pilot said might have been an airborne person with a jetpack, high in the busy skies near Los Angeles International Airport. The Los Angeles Times reports the Boeing 747 pilot radioed to report “a possible jetpack man in sight” about 6:12 p.m. Wednesday, according to a recording from the website LiveATC. The pilot spotted an object that might have resembled a jetpack 15 miles east of LAX at 5,000 feet altitude, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson told the newspaper, saying: “Out of an abundance of caution, air traffic controllers alerted other pilots in the vicinity.” “Use caution, the jetpack guy is back,” said one air traffic alert. “Did you see a UFO?” one air traffic controller asked a pilot. “We were looking but we did not see Iron Man,” the pilot responded. The FBI is working with the FAA to investigate the report, FBI spokesperson Laura Eimiller told the Times in an email. The agency has already looked into three other possible jetpack sightings in the skies above Los Angeles and has “not been able to validate any of the reports,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: More than 100 people had to spend the night on a highway, including nearly 30 who took refuge in a tunnel, after rain over an area burned by a wildfire once again triggered mudslides in western Colorado, authorities said Friday. The people were caught with their vehicles on Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon on Thursday night. Those in the tunnel were stuck for about nine hours until crews could carve out a path through the mud to reach them about 6:30 a.m. Friday, Garfield County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Walt Stowe said. The tunnel serves as a 24-hour operations center for the Colorado Department of Transportation, so it is relatively well-lit and has telephones, Stowe said. No injuries were reported. The transportation department accounted for 108 people, including 29 in the tunnel, who were stuck on the highway overnight. Between 65 and 70 people remained stranded at a rest stop Friday afternoon as crews worked to punch a safe passage through the debris. Mike Goolsby, a regional director for the transportation department, said the area was affected by about 10 slides, some 12 feet deep and up to 150 feet wide. Glenwood Canyon has cliffs towering up to 2,000 feet above the Colorado River, making it prone to rockslides and mudslides.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Supporters of Nelson Pinos, an Ecuadorian immigrant who first sought sanctuary from a federal deportation order in a New Haven church in 2017, are celebrating his temporary reprieve. The father of three, who has lived in the U.S. for 29 years, learned last week that immigration authorities have granted him a one-year stay, and supporters said Saturday that he has left the church for now. At the celebration Saturday, supporters of Pinos, 47, vowed to make sure he gets to remain in the country permanently, noting that the fight for his freedom and the freedom of other immigrants without legal status is far from over. “Today, we are not only celebrating a temporary stay, but we’re sending a loud message about a broken process,” said Miguel Castro, chairman of the Connecticut Hispanic Democratic Caucus. “This is the time to fix it and fix it good so families like Nelson and his wife and his children and many like him will never, ever go through something like this ever again.” Organizers of Saturday’s event said Pinos is the last of the sanctuary-seekers in Connecticut to be given a stay of deportation. Pinos could not attend Saturday’s celebration because he was quarantining after being exposed to someone infected with the coronavirus. But he thanked the crowd by cellphone.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: School officials across the state are trying everything to find bus drivers as a shortage causes logistical nightmares all over the country. Among the efforts are programs that would pay drivers more money, increase their wages if they service more than one route, and offer bonuses for steady attendance. But at least one school, EastSide Charter, might have a different solution: paying parents. The school on Tuesday launched a survey to determine the interest level in a program that would offer parents $700 per year per student to drop off their children and pick them up from the Wilmington school. “We’re looking at every idea right now,” said Aaron Bass, the school’s CEO. He said officials around the state are considering many options, even providing passes for students to take public transportation to school. That, however, wouldn’t work at EastSide, which services students through the eighth grade. “I can’t put a 5-year-old on a DART bus and say, ‘Good luck,’ ” he said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local music venue the Anthem finally reopened Friday, kicking things off with a special one-night-only performance from comedian and D.C. native Dave Chappelle, WUSA-TV reports. The first musical guest at the reopened venue will be Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on Aug. 7. Other upcoming shows include Modest Mouse, Kesha and Glass Animals. Masks are required inside the Anthem. Chapelle’s untitled documentary, meanwhile, was screened at the Kennedy Center on Sunday. The film centers on Chappelle’s current home in rural Ohio as the town deals with the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and as the community undergoes a cultural evolution following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which galvanized protests around the country against racial injustice and mistreatment at the hands of police.\n\nFlorida\n\nSebring: The 22-year project to restore the Kissimmee River from a straight, human-made channel to its natural meandering state has marked a major milestone. Officials involved in the nearly $1 billion Kissimmee River Restoration Project said at an event Thursday that 44 miles of the waterway have been returned to its curving path in central Florida. The project began in 1999 amid evidence that converting the river to a straight flood control canal in the 1970s damaged the environment, dumping more polluted water into Lake Okeechobee, sharply reducing waterfowl and bald eagle populations, and harming fish and invertebrates. The Kissimmee River’s restored floodplains and oxbows will help clean water laden with nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff, which has fed harmful algal blooms, plaguing the lake for decades. “Not only are we keeping water in the watershed and delivering it in the right volumes and frequencies; we’re also connecting with the floodplains where it cleans the water before it heads down into the lake,” said South Florida Water Management District Executive Director Drew Bartlett. Now that construction is complete, the next step is to increase storage in headwaters lakes and mimic how the river once naturally flowed. That will be done by 2026, officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican lawmakers have started a process that could lead to a takeover of elections in the state’s most populous county. Many in the GOP continue to claim that wrongdoing in reliably Democratic Fulton County had stolen the 2020 election from Donald Trump, even though an independent monitor found no evidence of fraud or impropriety. Lawmakers are using a tool created by Georgia’s sweeping new election law to exert influence over local elections. Democrats and voting rights advocates decry the takeover provision as an invitation for political interference. The county, with about 11% of the state’s electorate, includes most of the city of Atlanta. But Fulton County has been plagued with problems for years, and Republicans say it’s time for answers. State House Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones and four other GOP state representatives whose districts include parts of Fulton submitted a letter Friday to the State Election Board demanding a performance review of the county’s board of registration and elections. “I wrote the letter as a representative of constituents who have expressed concerns over the sloppy manner in which elections were conducted in Fulton County in 2020 and in the years leading up to then,” Jones, who represents a suburban north Fulton district, said Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials announced 622 new coronavirus cases Friday, the highest number of confirmed infections since the start of the pandemic. The total included cases from lab reporting delays from the prior three days, officials said, but the number is still a significant spike for the state of about 1.4 million people. The seven-day positivity rate rose to 5.1%. Officials said the average daily case count from the prior three days had topped 300. Previously, the record-high total for confirmed cases in a single day was 355, set in August 2020. Officials said the surge is associated with the highly contagious delta variant and encouraged people to get inoculated against COVID-19. “The pandemic is not over, and the best way forward is for people to get vaccinated,” Gov. David Ige said. Just over 60% of Hawaii residents are fully vaccinated. Hawaii Department of Health Director Libby Char said about 25% of the new infections are among children, but officials still plan to have kids return to school this week. “There is risk involved in everything. But I think we also have to be cognizant that there is a cost to not having children in school and having them fall further behind in learning and the continued social isolation,” Char said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Boise Police Department says officers removed flags emblazoned with the emblem of the neo-fascist Proud Boys organization after someone hung them from several overpasses on a busy interstate. Police spokesperson Haley Williams told the Idaho Statesman that officers removed the flags Saturday morning. It wasn’t immediately clear who hung up the flags on Interstate 84 overpasses in Boise, but Williams said anyone with information should contact the police department. The Proud Boys are considered a hate group by organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Proud Boys members describe themselves as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists.” Several members of the group have been charged in federal court with offenses related to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The flags mark the second recent public display from the neo-fascist group in southern Idaho. Proud Boys members marched in a Sagebrush Days community parade in Buhl in early July, raising concerns for many. At the time, the Buhl Chamber of Commerce, which organizes the parade, told The Times-News newspaper in Twin Falls that it would not “feed into any negative propaganda” about the Proud Boys’ appearance.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Illinois Chicago has received $6 million from the federal government to test a potential treatment for COVID-19. Researchers say the drug candidate, called VT-109, has been shown to help restore function to damaged lungs, among other things. The drug, administered as an intravenous treatment, will be tested in pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 to determine efficacy and toxicity before human trials are considered. The money comes through a technology and therapeutic development award from the U.S. Department of Defense, university officials announced in a recent news release. Researchers hope the testing will culminate in an application to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration program overseeing how potential drugs are evaluated for human clinical trials. It could take three or more years to get to that point, researchers estimate. Research on the drug has already been funded by awards from UIC and the National Institutes of Health, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than 200 police agencies across the state will be boosting their patrols this fall to crack down on school bus stop-arm violations and dangerous driving near school bus stops and in school zones. Gov. Eric Holcomb announced the extra patrols Wednesday and urged motorists to keep watch for school buses in the weeks ahead. “We’re entering back-to-school season in Indiana, which means motorists need to watch for buses and drive cautiously at all times,” Holcomb said in a statement. Bus drivers and school transportation officials will help police identify areas where extra patrols are most needed under Indiana’s SAVE blitz, which stands for Stop Arm Violation Enforcement. That program is supported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute, The Journal Gazette reports. In 2019, Indiana lawmakers approved tougher penalties for drivers who pass school buses with extended stop arms after three children were fatally struck while crossing a highway to board a bus. A spring police enforcement period netted more than 5,600 citations, including 251 for stop-arm violations, 309 for texting while driving, and almost 1,900 for speeding, the Criminal Justice Institute said in a news release. About 1,700 warnings also were issued.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has no plans to offer $100 incentives to Iowans to get COVID-19 shots after President Joe Biden pleaded with states and local governments to use federal funds to entice people to stop the rapid spread of a coronavirus variant, an aide said Friday. While many states and some Iowa counties have offered incentives for citizens to get vaccinations, Iowa’s governor continues to call for citizens to get vaccinated while repeating that ultimately it’s their choice. Iowa had 49.5% of the population fully immunized as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That ranks 21st in the nation. Vaccination rates have fallen rapidly in the state since the spring, from a seven-day average of more than 17,000 people becoming fully vaccinated in May to 1,402 in recent days. Reynolds spokesman Pat Garrett said Friday that the governor has no plans to comply with Biden’s offer Thursday for states to spend $100 in federal funds for each newly vaccinated person. In an email, Iowa Department of Public Health Sarah Ekstrand said the state’s strategy is unchanged from its current “education and communications efforts.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday recommended that nearly everyone inside K-12 schools or riding school buses in the state be required to wear a mask, and Kansas State University will require masks in its buildings, whether people are vaccinated against COVID-19 or not. Kelly’s office issued updated guidance for elementary, middle and high schools in response to a surge in new COVID-19 cases over the past five weeks tied to the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. She also is citing revised recommendations on masks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We know our children belong in the classroom, but it’s critical that we provide Kansas school districts with support and tools they need to keep our kids safe,” Kelly said in a statement. Last week she issued a mask mandate for state government workers and visitors to state buildings in most of Kansas’ 105 counties. Kansas State cited that order and the CDC’s new guidance on masks in announcing its mandate for people to wear masks indoors when not alone. It takes effect Monday on Kansas State’s main campus in Manhattan, its Polytechnic Campus in Salina and its satellite campus in Olathe. The University of Kansas is also recommending that everyone wear masks indoors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Lottery smashed its sales record in its just-completed fiscal year, with the boon largely due to a lack of other entertainment options during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the head of the 32-year-old organization. The Kentucky Lottery announced last week that from July 2020 through June 2021, the organization saw total sales of $1,586,325,000. That marked a 31.8% increase, or $382.9 million in additional sales, from the prior fiscal year. Mary Harville, Kentucky Lottery president and CEO, said that during the start of the pandemic in March 2020, “things started to close, including a lot of entertainment venues.” But “places that sell lottery tickets – grocery stores, convenience stores and gas stations – stayed open,” said Harville, the first female head of the organization. She said while other items sold out at stpres during the early months of the pandemic, her team ensured ticket dispensers and vending machines were “fully stocked.” That helped out retailers, who received more than $90 million in commissions through Kentucky lottery sales. The record-breaking year for sales also paid its dividends for Kentucky, as proceeds to the commonwealth totaled a historic $354.8 million – which is $76.3 million, or 27.4%, more than last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nWest Grand Terre Island: Excavators, bulldozers and a dredge miles away from them are working on a $100 million project to raise and reshape a barrier island. West Grand Terre Island helps protect communities from New Orleans’ west bank to Bayou Lafourche from hurricanes and storm surge, depending on the storm’s direction, said Greg Grandy, deputy executive director of Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. But like East Grand Terre Island, where some of the BP oil spill’s iconic images were made, West Grand Terre was heavily oiled during the 2010 spill and was severely eroded before that. The two islands were one when Jean Lafitte and his Baratarian pirates made Grand Terre and nearby Grand Isle their headquarters but now are more than a mile apart. About $100 million in spill restoration money is being used to restore and create about 256 acres of beach and dune and 143 acres of marsh on West Grand Terre. About $2 million from various other sources was used to remove a fisheries lab destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “It is one of the most historically and ecologically important barrier islands in Louisiana,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said when funding for this and two other projects was announced in May.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: The hospital in a community that was the epicenter of a so-called superspreader event plans to require all staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19, becoming the first hospital in Maine to do so. All staff at Millinocket Regional Hospital will be required to be fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Modern vaccines within six weeks of final approval by the Food and Drug Administration, officials said. “Millinocket Regional Hospital is committed to providing a safe working environment for all employees and the safest environment possible for patients to receive care,” said Dr. Robert Peterson, the hospital’s chief executive officer. A wedding nearly a year ago in the Millinocket area was linked to outbreaks in at least two other locations in Maine, with more than 170 people contracting the coronavirus and seven deaths since then. Several other Maine hospitals are in discussions about vaccine requirements after national organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Nursing Association, urged them to do so. More Maine hospitals are expected to follow Millinocket in announcing vaccine mandates for employees in the near future, Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association, told the Portland Press Herald.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The family of a Maryland woman who unwittingly spurred a research bonanza when her cancer cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951 has hired a prominent civil rights lawyer to seek compensation from pharmaceutical companies. The relatives of Henrietta Lacks have hired Ben Crump, an attorney who has represented the families of a number of Black people who have died at the hands of police and vigilantes in recent years. Those clients include the families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin and Breonna Taylor. The Baltimore Sun had reported that a lawyer for the Lacks family said a legal team was investigating lawsuits against numerous potential defendants. Cells taken from Lacks have been widely used in biomedical research. The so-called HeLa cells became crucial for key developments in such areas as basic biology, understanding viruses and other germs, cancer treatments, in vitro fertilization and vaccine development. Lacks became famous in 2010 with publication of Rebecca Skloot’s best-selling book, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” As that book relates, Lacks was under anesthesia on an operating table at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore one day in 1951, undergoing treatment for cervical cancer, when a surgeon shaved tissue from her tumor for a research project.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gambling regulators, in response to complaints, want to know why two of the state’s casinos have not yet brought back poker. Bruce Band, deputy director of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau, said at a meeting Thursday that the commission normally receives about five complaints a month but lately has been receiving about 50 per month, many of them regarding poker, the Boston Herald reports. When casinos reopened after being shut down during the pandemic, the commission limited poker tables to four players. Encore Boston Harbor and MGM Springfield said that limit would not have made poker profitable enough to bring back. Even though the limit was lifted in May, poker has still not returned. Encore executive Jacqui Krum told the commission that what was once the poker area has been repurposed during COVID-19 and that the casino is having trouble hiring. “We remain in continual hiring mode. We simply cannot find enough dealers, cashiers or food servers,” Krum said, adding that reopening poker right now would require shutting down other games.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The White House and Canada have issued a joint statement of support for a commuter bridge that when completed will span the Detroit River, connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. The statement issued Thursday calls the Gordie Howe International Bridge “a top infrastructure priority” for both governments. It comes as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican senators try to work out a compromise over a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package. “This full-throated support of this vital bridge comes as President Biden and Congress continue to make progress on bipartisan and significant investment in transportation and other infrastructure,” Michigan Gov. Whitmer said in her own statement. “The ongoing construction of this bridge has created jobs on both sides of the border, and will continue to spur economic development for many years to come.” In 2012, then-Gov. Rick Snyder and former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper struck a deal calling for Canada to pay for the bridge after the Republican governor ran into opposition in the GOP-led Legislature. The $4.4 billion, six-lane span is expected to open in late 2024. It’s named for Gordie Howe, a native of Canada and hockey legend who starred for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has extended an air quality alert until noon Tuesday for the entire state, due to what authorities are calling an “unprecedented significant air quality event.” Minnesota has been dealing with smoke from Canadian wildfires that has created some of the highest particulate readings on record. An air quality alert was set to expire Friday afternoon, but it was extended through Tuesday and includes the whole state. The wildfires are north of the Canadian border in Ontario and Manitoba. The MPCA said smoke would continue pouring into the state into Sunday. High pressure will build over the area, and the smoke will recirculate under that high pressure through Tuesday, leading to a prolonged period of heavy smoke. The agency said fine particle levels are expected to reach the purple category, a level considered very unhealthy for everyone, across north-central and south-central Minnesota. That area includes Roseau, Hibbing, Brainerd, St. Cloud and the Twin Cities. It also includes the tribal nations of Red Lake, Leech Lake and Mille Lacs.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A movie called “My Stolen Life” started filming last week in this city that has a wide view of the Mississippi River. The film, for the Lifetime network, is about twin sisters who have endured a traumatic situation. One becomes a famous writer, and the other is driven mad. The Vicksburg Post reports the movie features several Vicksburg landmarks and some local faces. Vicksburg Police Chief Penny Jones plays herself in one scene. “The film wasn’t originally set in Vicksburg, but we came here and didn’t want to try to make it look like it was set somewhere else,” producer Liana Rae Perez said. Filming locations include the B.B. Club, Vicksburg’s riverfront murals and downtown area, and the antebellum home Anchuca. The film is directed and produced by Atlanta native Dylan Vox.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: St. Louis County Police Chief Mary Barton, who has been criticized for her handling of racial discrimination complaints, announced Friday that she will retire. Barton, who was appointed chief in April 2020, said she would step down after a leave of absence that was scheduled to begin Sunday. The leave will allow her to continue to be paid while she uses accrued vacation time, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The Board of Police Commissioners and the St. Louis County Council have criticized Barton over her performance, particularly her response to racial discrimination within the department. The Ethical Society of Police, which works for racial and gender equity in St. Louis and St. Louis County, also criticized Barton, who is white. In response to the criticism, Barton said she was doing her best to make positive changes. “I have done my job in a professional manner, and I have moved this police department forward,” she said in April. “Myself and the Board of Police Commissioners are committed to moving this police department forward.”\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities ordered evacuations along the shore of a northwestern Montana lake Sunday as winds pushed a wildfire toward the area. The Finley Point/Yellow Bay Fire Department said in a social media post that flames had crossed Montana Highway 35 and were pushing toward Flathead Lake on Sunday morning. The evacuation order included Finley Point the Skidoo Lane area and houses located along a 6-mile stretch of Highway 35 north of Polson. The fire detected Saturday morning 8 miles east of Polson is believed to be human-caused, the Flathead Beacon reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Offutt Air Force Base south of Omaha has announced it is reinstating a mask mandate, requiring all employees, contractors and visitors to wear face masks indoors. The requirement applies to everyone, even those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The military base outside Bellevue said in a social media post that the new requirement came from the defense secretary’s office and was triggered by rising coronavirus cases in Sarpy County. The requirement went into full effect Friday. Additionally, the post said, those who are not vaccinated must maintain a distance of 6 feet from others, as outlined in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nIncline Village: Transportation officials at Lake Tahoe say they are experimenting with a new effort to try to change the behavior of visitors who fill up an overcrowded parking area for one of the lake’s most popular beaches by hitting them in their wallets. The parking lot was built when roadside parking in the area was prohibited for safety concerns on the edge of the lake south of Incline Village. It’s at the start of the newly constructed trail that leads to Hidden Beach. Under the plan, parking fees cost as much as $6 or $7 an hour depending on the day and time the visitor arrives. In addition, visitors can’t use cash to park there – the machines only accept credit cards. Tahoe Transportation District Manager Carl Hasty told the Nevada Appeal the fees are an experiment to see if visitor patterns can be changed so that not everyone arrives at peak beach times from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. He said it’s a “pilot effort to incentivize people to come when it isn’t the peak time.” The problem, he said, is that Hidden Beach is so popular that there just isn’t room for everyone who wants to visit, especially during the summer from May through early September. He said the parking fees are lower during spring and fall. They are also lower on weekdays than they are Friday through Sunday but higher on holidays.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday vetoed a bill that would have moved up the date of state primary elections from September to the first Tuesday in August. New Hampshire is known for its first-in-the-nation presidential primary every four years, but its state primary, held the second Tuesday in September, is one of the nation’s latest. Sununu, in his veto message, said he agrees with Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who’s run New Hampshire’s elections for 45 years, that the bill “creates more problems than it solves.” Sununu said the date change would move the elections and the campaign season into the middle of the summer, a time when more people would be enjoying their vacations than participating in the electoral process. He also said that moving the date to the summer could make it harder for communities to recruit poll workers and election day volunteers. The governor said some advocates of the bill “point to the supposed challenge of election officials meeting the deadlines to send absentee ballots to members of the military or other overseas Granite Staters.” But Sununu said New Hampshire has never failed to meet those deadlines.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New mothers will soon be able to get up to three free visits from nurses after giving birth under a new state program designed to support healthy development and reduce postpartum complications, including death. With Gov. Phil Murphy’s signing Thursday of the Statewide Newborn Home Nurse Visitation Program, New Jersey is now the second state in the country, after Oregon, to offer home nurse visits to infants and their parents. But Murphy said New Jersey’s program is the “strongest” and “most comprehensive.” “Today we take a huge step forward in making our state the safest in the nation to both have a child and raise a child,” Murphy said at a ceremony in Newark. New Jersey has a long way to go to achieve that goal. In a country with the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, New Jersey has a “crisis” of dying mothers, as bill sponsors have said. The state ranked 45th in the nation in maternal mortality in 2018, with 38 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the United Health Foundation. The Murphy administration ranks it even worse, 47th in the U.S. Black women in particular are at high risk in New Jersey. According to Nurture NJ, they are seven times more likely than white women to die after childbirth, and Black babies are three times more likely to die within a year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The second-ranking legislator in the state House of Representatives resigned Friday amid criminal investigations into her ties to a private contractor for the Albuquerque school district where she also works. Democratic House leaders announced the resignation of Majority Leader Sheryl Williams Stapleton while the investigation continues into possible racketeering, money laundering, kickbacks and violations of a law governing the conduct of state lawmakers. Stapleton said in her resignation letter that she “unequivocally” denies the allegations against her but decided she must devote her time and energy to fully defending herself. “I have made the difficult decision that it is in the best interest of the state,” she wrote in the letter to Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. Stapleton, who began serving in the Legislature in 1995, oversees career technical education for Albuquerque Public Schools, the largest school district in the state and the top employer in the city. She has been placed on paid administrative leave by the school district. No charges have been filed against her.\n\nNew York\n\nMineola: Lawmakers in a suburban county are set to vote Monday on a proposal that would allow police officers to sue protesters and collect financial damages – a move civil rights activists say is payback for demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis. Newsday reports that the bill being considered by the Nassau County Legislature would make police officers and other first responders a protected class under the county’s Human Rights Law, which currently bars discrimination based on race, religion, gender and sexual orientation. No other professions are protected under the Human Rights Law. The bill would allow a lawyer for the Long Island county to sue protesters on behalf of officers and calls for fines of up to $25,000 for anyone who harasses, menaces or injures an officer. The fine amount would be doubled if the offending behavior happened “in the course of participating in a riot,” the bill says. Civil rights lawyer Frederick Brewington told reporters Friday that the bill violates free speech rights and, if passed, will have a chilling effect on protesters. The NAACP said it will bring members to Monday’s vote. “This is intended to evoke fear in the community,” Brewington said. “This is payback. It’s not right. It’s not acceptable, and it is against the law.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Another historically Black university in North Carolina has announced it will pay off all outstanding balances for students as a response to pandemic-related debt. Johnson C. Smith University will cancel about $300,000 in debts, The Charlotte Observer reports. Last month, Livingstone College in Salisbury said it would forgive more than $2.8 million in debt for students who attended during the 2021 spring semester. N.C. Central University in Durham has cleared more than $10 million in student debt, using federal COVID-19 relief funds to help a fourth of the student population. Many of these programs are possible because of the federal CARES Act. The funds also provided all returning JCSU students with direct relief last fall: $2,500 for returning students and $2,000 for new students, according to the university. Also, Pfeiffer University, a private school in Misenheimer, announced Thursday that it would eliminate $425,000 in student debts.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The State Water Commission on Friday approved $5 million in new aid to help ranchers who are battling drought conditions this summer. As part of the aid, the commission approved two additional water supply assistance programs and allocated more money to an existing program, Gov. Doug Burgum and Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said in a joint statement. “North Dakota producers continue to face unprecedented drought conditions that are devastating crops, decimating livestock herds and destroying billions of dollars in value on farms and ranches that have been built over generations,” said Burgum, who chairs the State Water Commission. “The relief approved today will help livestock producers manage this adversity and invest in infrastructure that builds resiliency against extreme drought conditions now and in the future.” The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map, released Thursday, shows more than half of North Dakota is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories, the Bismarck Tribune reports. All of the state is in some form of drought. State officials say conditions driven by lack of precipitation and record heat are the worst in at least 30 years.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The difference in foster care payments between licensed caregivers and relatives stepping in to help “is neither ideal nor even satisfactory,” a judge said as he dismissed a lawsuit seeking to close that gap. Federal Judge Michael Barrett acknowledged that children cared for by relatives deserve more money but said advocates suing over the payment discrepancies didn’t have a claim under federal law. At issue are relatives who aren’t licensed caregivers but are approved to care for children taken from their parents. The arrangement is often referred to as kinship care. Child advocates argue the state must follow a 2017 federal appeals court decision ordering equality in payments to kinship caregivers, and in November they sued to force adherence to that ruling. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law late last year providing a partial fix. The plan authorizes a $10.20 per child per day payment for kinship caregivers for up to nine months. Advocates say that money falls far short of what licensed foster care parents receive, citing as an example the $1,500 to $9,667 monthly payments per foster child in Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Republican Party faced fierce criticism Friday for a Facebook post likening COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the persecution of Jewish people in Nazi Germany. The post on the party’s official Facebook page urged people to call the lieutenant governor and ask him to call a special session to prohibit employers from requiring their employees to get vaccinated. It featured a picture of a yellow Star of David with the word “unvaccinated” on it and said: “Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.” Roberta Clark, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, called the post “highly inappropriate” and urged party officials to apologize. “To compare the actions taken by Nazi Germany to a public health discussion is ill-informed and inappropriate,” Clark said. “An apology is really appropriate, and it shows leadership and sensitivity to the harmful impact this has made.” John Bennett, the party’s new chairman, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message left at the party’s headquarters. The party’s vice chairman, Shane Jemison, said Friday that he wasn’t certain who created the post, but he called it “beyond abhorrent.”\n\nOregon\n\nJoseph: More than 150 Nez Perce (Niimiipuu) people returned and blessed part of their homeland Thursday, a hundred years after the U.S. Army drove them from the Wallowa Valley in eastern Oregon. In direct violation of the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla, the Nez Perce in 1877 were forced from their 7.5 million-acre homeland to a 750,000-acre reservation in Idaho. For years, the tribe has worked to keep a connection to the ancestral land from which it was driven. Last year, it successfully reclaimed part of that land. The Nez Perce tribe purchased a 148-acre property in Joseph – known as Am’saaxpa, or Place of Boulders – in December but could not formally perform a blessing ceremony until Thursday due to COVID-19 concerns. The property had been privately owned and operated as a ranch for more than a hundred years. It is located at the edge of the city’s rodeo grounds. Surrounded by the Wallowa Mountains, the property rights include the house near Airport Road built in 1884, barns, grassland, and Wallowa River frontage where the Nez Perce would camp and catch sockeye salmon. It also includes the ridge where Chief Joseph once held council.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A new dashboard of real-time data on prison and parole populations shows the state has made strides to reduce racial inequity, but Black and Latino residents are still greatly overrepresented in prisons and on parole. The dashboard built by the group Recidiviz, a tech nonprofit that partners with governmental agencies to use data to reduce incarceration with a focus on racial inequities, was made public Friday and includes information on prison and parole populations as well as a tab to specifically look at racial disparities in the system. Pennsylvania officials hope the dashboard can be used to track the outcomes of current criminal justice practices and shape future policies. “Transparency creates a common language for all of us to talk about the criminal justice system, what’s working and what’s not, and to chart a path forward,” said Clementine Jacoby, the executive director of Recidiviz. It’s the second public dashboard the group has built in partnership with a state – North Dakota was the first – and they hope more states will agree to partner in the future. Jacoby said the dashboard tab that looks at racial disparities is important because it shows leadership at the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections is making equity a priority.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public schools in the state are now required to teach a comprehensive African American history and heritage curriculum under legislation signed into law Friday by Gov. Daniel McKee. “The inclusion of African heritage and history in Rhode Island curricula is long overdue,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “I hope that Rhode Island will lead the nation in the effort to educate our young people on a full scope of history, including teaching students about events that took place right where they live.” The curriculum was developed by Rhode Island historical and academic institutions. The ceremonial bill signing took place at the Old Brick School House in Providence, a building that dates to 1769 and in 1828 became a city-supported school for Black children. “Knowing this truth is essential to a united society and I am very happy that these lessons will finally be presented to our students, and adults as well, so that they may go forth into the world truly knowing the many parts of our society that work for everyone and that sadly, currently there are still too many remaining caught in a cycle of intolerance and injustice,” state Rep. Anastasia Williams, D-Providence, said in a statement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolinians receiving federal food aid will continue to get extra emergency benefits through the end of the year, even though a pandemic-related state of emergency ended last month. State officials announced Friday that they were extending the deadline for the additional federal supplements, which were set to expire Aug. 1 after Gov. Henry McMaster brought the state’s COVID-19 state of emergency to an end in June. The Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program serves 610,000 people in about 295,000 households in South Carolina. On average, each household has received an additional $177 per month in emergency supplements throughout the pandemic. McMaster has authorized the state’s Department of Social Services to ensure residents continue receiving the extra benefits until Dec. 31 or the end of a federal public health emergency order, whichever comes first. “Our moral and ethical duty during the COVID-19 pandemic is to protect the lives of the most vulnerable South Carolinians – our elderly, young and at-risk population,” wrote Gov. Henry McMaster in a letter to the state’s Department of Social Services. The social services agency received approval Thursday from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue providing the emergency benefits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: Law enforcement agencies are preparing for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and are on alert for increased outlaw gang activity. The weeklong event that begins Friday is in its 81st year, and some believe that may mean a larger Hells Angels presence than usual. The number “81” is metonym and shorthand for Hells Angels, with H being the 8th letter of the alphabet and A the first. Meade County Sheriff Ron Merwin told KOTA-TV law enforcement is aware of the significance. “I would suspect that we’re going to have at least the normal number of Hells Angels around here,” Merwin said. “We might have a few more than normal. My suspicion is they might have some activities here because of the 81st.” Merwin said that although the biker crowd is largely respectful to law enforcement, officers are preparing for any confrontation that may occur. “I think one thing kind of leads to another, and trouble finds them,” Merwin said. “But I don’t suspect that they come here openly looking for it. They just don’t back down from it either.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Authorities on Saturday night reopened the Interstate 40 bridge linking Arkansas and Tennessee that had been closed ever since a crack was discovered in the span in May. The Hernando DeSoto Bridge, a key artery for U.S. commerce, reopened to the public for eastbound traffic, according to video shared by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The eastbound lanes had previously been scheduled to open Monday, but officials recently moved up those plans. The state transportation department has said it plans to reopen the bridge’s westbound lanes next Friday, though it said that could also get moved up. The I-40 bridge over the Mississippi River was shut down May 11 after inspectors found a crack in one of two 900-foot horizontal steel beams critical for the bridge’s structural integrity, forcing thousands of trucks and cars to detour to the nearby Interstate 55 bridge during the I-40 bridge’s repairs. Beverly Robertson, CEO and President of the Greater Memphis Chamber, celebrated the news of the reopening. “The trucking industry has lost a lot with us being the third-busiest trucking corridor in the country. So many goods and services come here and then go out from there,” Robertson told WREG-TV.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Country music legend Willie Nelson led more than a thousand spectators in singing “vote them out” Saturday from the steps of the Texas Capitol during a rally wrapping up a four-day march in support of Democratic state legislators who bolted for Washington two weeks ago to block GOP-backed voting restrictions. Families with lawn chairs spread out across the sprawling Capitol greens in Austin. Clergy, politicians, constituents and musicians all spoke out about the proposals to impose voter ID requirements, limit ballot drop boxes and mail voting, and strip local officials of their election authority. The special session that the exodus by Texas Democrats halted is set to expire this week, but Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has pledged to schedule a new one as soon as the lawmakers return to the state. “If you don’t like who’s in there, vote them out,” Nelson sang, inviting he crowd to join him in singing lyrics he’d previously written about taking a stand at the ballot box. “I felt like I needed to be here. It is a history-making event that is so necessary right now,” said Brenda Hanson, 75, of Austin. “I am a descendant of slavery, and I am not interested in moving back; I want to see this country go forward.” Hanson said she is disabled but otherwise would have participated in the nearly 30-mile walk.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Five shuttle bus drivers at Zion National Park have quit over verbal abuse they’ve experienced from visitors angry about mask requirements on board, the park superintendent said. The iconic red-rock park in southern Utah is the third most visited in the nation, and visitation is only increasing. The shuttle buses are the only vehicles allowed on the road through the main canyon during the busy season. While mask mandates have been lifted in the rest of the state, face coverings are still required on the federally run shuttle buses. Zion National Park Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh told the Springdale town council July 14 that the contractor running the buses has seen five recent resignations. “It seems unnecessary for that issue to develop,” he said. Rangers are also hearing visitor “frustrations” over masks, said Zion spokesperson Amanda Rowland. The park is working with the gateway town of Springdale to provide messaging on the mask mandate, she said.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: A giant ladderback chair that stands 19 feet tall may be big, but it wasn’t tough enough for some vandals. Damage to the massive “Big Chair” made from 3,000 pounds of cedar and white pine was captured early Thursday by surveillance video outside a credit union where the chair sits. The video shows two male and two female suspects climbing and jumping on the chair. The original chair was built in the late 1940s and became a popular roadside attraction. Over the decades it has been rebuilt several times. The security video captured the moment the joints gave way, apparently injuring one of the vandals, who was seen being helped away. The Bennington Banner reports the weight of the people who climbed on the chair caused the sockets that held the cross pieces to split wide open. Now the chair’s wooden joints are in splinters, and the rope seat is no longer in place. “We have people on a daily basis come and take pictures with the chair. They drive here specifically to see it,” said Linda M. Bow, the chief business officer for the Tri State Area Federal Credit Union’s Bennington branch. “It’s going to be hard to replace,” Bow said. “It wasn’t meant for climbing.”\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: A judge has upheld most of a lawsuit Liberty University filed against its former leader Jerry Falwell Jr. after an acrimonious parting last year. The lawsuit survived its first round of legal challenges Friday as Falwell’s attorneys argued motions seeking its dismissal before Lynchburg Circuit Judge Fred Watson, The News & Advance reports. Falwell’s departure from the evangelical school founded by his father came after Giancarlo Granda, a younger business partner of the Falwell family, said that he had a years­long sexual relationship with Falwell’s wife, Becki Falwell, and that Jerry Falwell participated in some of the liaisons as a voyeur. Falwell denied the report and has alleged Granda extorted the family, which Granda denied. Liberty claims Falwell crafted a “well-resourced exit strategy” from his role as president and chancellor at the school in the form of a lucrative 2019 employment agreement while withholding damaging information about the personal scandal that exploded into public view the following year. The agreement included a raise, which Falwell has said amounted to $250,000, and a $2.5 million severance package. The lawsuit demanding at least $10 million alleged Falwell breached fiduciary duties to the school and entered into a business conspiracy against it.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: New findings from an Oakland-based nonprofit that spent recent months analyzing Seattle’s 911 calls say up to half the calls city police receive can be responded to without armed, sworn officers. The Seattle Times reports police, while generally supportive of the findings, say they have questions about how realistic that number is. The report, published this week, is a result of part of Mayor Jenny Durkan’s plan, launched last year, to reimagine policing in Seattle. The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform found at some point in the future, an “alternative, non-sworn response” could be appropriate for up to 49% of Seattle Police Department calls, or about 685,000 dispatch responses between 2017 and 2019. The institute also found about 80% of Seattle Police Department calls are noncriminal responses, though it noted that some calls not coded as a criminal incident might still involve some criminal behavior. As for shorter-term changes, the report noted about 12% of calls, including “person down” and low-priority welfare checks, “can and should be explored for alternative responses” in the near future.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An airport serving the city will soon have a new name: West Virginia International Yeager Airport. The airport board approved the name change Wednesday, effective Jan. 1. The Charleston airport said the change to include “international” in the name is permitted with a U.S. Customs building at the airport that will be completed in December. Yeager is one of 31 commercial airports without a city, state or region in the name, the airport said in an email. There are only five states without an international airport, the email said. It is hoped the name change will help market the state to business and leisure travelers and attract future air service, the airport said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of new daily coronavirus cases reported in the state has surpassed 1,000 for the first time in months, fueled by the spread of the more contagious delta variant, health officials said Friday. The Wisconsin Department of Health reported 1,058 new cases of COVID-19 in the state Friday – the highest since April 8. The number of cases that stem from the delta variant has doubled. The seven-day average of daily cases in Wisconsin has increased for the 24th straight day. Wisconsin Department of Health Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said vaccination against COVID-19 is key to stopping the virus’s spread. “The proportion of sequenced tests that are the delta variant is high in our state, and high throughout our country. We know the spread is related to that variant. And when we look at the data, it is important to remember that increased spread also increases the danger of new variants developing,” she said. More than 49% of Wisconsin residents have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and nearly 52% had received at least one dose as of Friday, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. From mid-July to Tuesday, statewide hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have increased 51%. Health officials say that number is expected to grow.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A public ceremony to commemorate the life of former U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi will be held Friday at the Gillette College Pronghorn Center, the Gillette Memorial Chapel announced. Enzi, a Wyoming Republican known as a consensus-builder in an increasingly polarized Washington, died last week after he broke his neck in a bicycle accident near his home in Gillette. He was 77. He served 24 years in the U.S. Senate, 10 years in the Wyoming Legislature and eight years as Gillette’s mayor. The ceremony is set to begin at 1 p.m. and will be officiated by Pastor Donavon Voigt of First Baptist Church. Instead of flowers, the funeral home suggests making donations to Project Mercy, an organization combatting poverty in Ethiopia; the Mike and Diana Enzi Scholarship Fund at the University of Wyoming; and the Wyoming Community Foundation Mike & Diana Enzi Charitable Fund.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/02"}]}

The two-year journey to the asteroid covered 1.2 billion miles.\n\nThe SUV-sized spacecaft arrived at the Bennu asteroid about 10 a.m. Arizona time, and it took NASA about seven minutes to confirm arrival because the signal from the spacecraft had to travel through a series of antennas known as the Deep Space Network.\n\n\"My heart is three times faster than normal, but I’m super excited,” said Heather Enos, the mission's deputy principal investigator from the UA.\n\nMonday's arrival represented a \"personal joy\" to Enos for many reasons. She, and many others on the science team at the university in Tucson, have been working on the project for a decade.\n\nScientists and engineers are now ready for the mission's next phase, which consists of flying over and evaluating the asteroid.\n\n“We’re really looking forward to the next chapter,\" she said.\n\nHere are the main things to know about the mission:\n\nOnce spacecraft arrives at asteroid, then what?\n\nOSIRIS-REx will spend more than a year evaluating the asteroid. The spacecraft will fly over the asteroid's north pole, equator and south pole to within 4.4 miles of its surface.\n\n“We’re kind of like an aircraft that’s doing reconnaissance,\" said Dante Lauretta, a UA professor of planetary science and the mission's principal investigator.\n\nThe maneuvers will enable scientists and engineers to map, measure and observe the surface of the asteroid, which is a third of a mile across.\n\n\"All of 2019 is mapping and exploring and finding the 'X marks the spot' mark where we want to get the sample,\" Lauretta said.\n\nScientists will look for an area that's free of large rocks and steep slopes, which could damage or tip over the spacecraft. They'll also look for a place with abundant surface debris.\n\nOne of the instruments carried onboard was built at Arizona State University, the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or OTES. The instrument can analyze minerals and compounds on the asteroid's surface and was designed by a team led by ASU Professor Phil Christensen.\n\nHow to collect an asteroid sample?\n\nThe spacecraft won't land on the asteroid to collect a sample. Instead, the craft will maneuver close. A 9-foot robotic arm with an attached filter will trap gravel and dust inside.\n\nThe filter is designed to pick up from 2 ounces to 4 pounds of material.\n\nIn case the first pass fails, scientists and engineers have two more opportunities to get it right.\n\nSample collection is scheduled for July 2020.\n\nOnce the sample is collected, the OSIRIS-REx can't immediately head back to Earth. It has to wait until the asteroid's orbit will allow it to head toward Earth, which doesn't happen until March 2021.\n\nThe trip back isn't quick. It will take 2½ years.\n\nMORE: How OSIRIS-REx will bring back pieces of an asteroid\n\nHow does sample get back to Earth?\n\nThe spacecraft arrives near Earth in late September 2023.\n\nA few hours before reaching Earth's atmosphere, the craft will jettison a capsule containing the sample and put it on a trajectory to the planet.\n\nThe capsule will hit the Earth's atmosphere at about 28,000 mph, free falling until its parachute deploys. The main parachute is designed to release about 2 miles above the Earth, and land in the Utah desert, about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City.\n\nFrom there, NASA will take the capsule to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where officials will open it and disperse the contents for study.\n\nWhat happens to the spacecraft?\n\nThe spacecraft won't land in the desert because it's not equipped with landing gear. After jettisoning the capsule, the craft will maneuver itself into an orbit around the sun.\n\nNASA will still be able to communicate with the craft, provided its solar panels are working and recharge the batteries. But once OSIRIS-REx runs out of fuel, NASA won't be able to change its trajectory.\n\nWhy is OSIRIS-REx mission important?\n\nNASA missions have studied asteroids from a distance. But no U.S. space mission has collected and returned a sample to Earth.\n\nBennu was chosen because it's close to Earth and represents a \"time capsule\" from the early solar system. Scientists believe Bennu broke off from a larger asteroid 1 billion to 2 billion years ago and then got locked into an orbit near the Earth.\n\nBy studying its material, they hope to learn more about the early solar system and the role asteroids may have played in distributing life-forming compounds to Earth.\n\nWhat does OSIRIS-REx stand for?\n\nGet ready. It's a mouthful. OSIRIS-REx is short for \"Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer.\"\n\nTry saying that three times fast.\n\nReach the reporter at 602-444-8072 or anne.ryman@arizonarepublic.com.\n\nMORE ABOUT OSIRIS-REx", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/19/osiris-rex-mission-nasa-spacecraft-prepares-sample-first-asteroid/3713584001/", "title": "Osiris-Rex mission: NASA spacecraft prepares to sample first asteroid", "text": "Marcia Dunn\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — After almost two years circling an ancient asteroid hundreds of millions of miles away, a NASA spacecraft this week will attempt to descend to the treacherous, boulder-packed surface and snatch a handful of rubble.\n\nThe drama unfolds Tuesday as the U.S. takes its first crack at collecting asteroid samples for return to Earth, a feat accomplished so far only by Japan.\n\nBrimming with names inspired by Egyptian mythology, the Osiris-Rex mission is looking to bring back at least 2 ounces worth of asteroid Bennu, the biggest otherworldly haul from beyond the moon.\n\nThe van-sized spacecraft is aiming for the relatively flat middle of a tennis court-sized crater named Nightingale — a spot comparable to a few parking places here on Earth. Boulders as big as buildings loom over the targeted touchdown zone.\n\n“So for some perspective, the next time you park your car in front of your house or in front of a coffee shop and walk inside, think about the challenge of navigating Osiris-Rex into one of these spots from 200 million miles away,” said NASA’s deputy project manager Mike Moreau.\n\nOnce it drops out of its half-mile-high orbit around Bennu, the spacecraft will take a deliberate four hours to make it all the way down, to just above the surface.\n\nThen the action cranks up when Osiris-Rex’s 11-foot arm reaches out and touches Bennu. Contact should last five to 10 seconds, just long enough to shoot out pressurized nitrogen gas and suck up the churned dirt and gravel. Programmed in advance, the spacecraft will operate autonomously during the unprecedented touch-and-go maneuver. With an 18-minute lag in radio communication each way, ground controllers for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin near Denver can’t intervene.\n\nIf the first attempt doesn’t work, Osiris-Rex can try again. Any collected samples won’t reach Earth until 2023.\n\nWhile NASA has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles, it’s never attempted to sample one of the nearly 1 million known asteroids lurking in our solar system until now. Japan, meanwhile, expects to get samples from asteroid Ryugu in December — in the milligrams at most — 10 years after bringing back specks from asteroid Itokawa.\n\nBennu is an asteroid picker’s paradise.\n\nThe big, black, roundish, carbon-rich space rock — taller than New York’s Empire State Building — was around when our solar system was forming 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists consider it a time capsule full of pristine building blocks that could help explain how life formed on Earth and possibly elsewhere.\n\n“This is all about understanding our origins,” said the mission’s principal scientist, Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona.\n\nThere also are selfish reasons for getting to know Bennu better.\n\nThe solar-orbiting asteroid, which swings by Earth every six years, could take aim at us late in the next century. NASA puts the odds of an impact at 1-in-2,700. The more scientists know about potentially menacing asteroids like Bennu, the safer Earth will be.\n\nWhen Osiris-Rex blasted off in 2016 on the more than $800 million mission, scientists envisioned sandy stretches at Bennu. So the spacecraft was designed to ingest small pebbles less than an inch across.\n\nScientists were stunned to find massive rocks and chunky gravel all over the place when the spacecraft arrived in 2018. And pebbles were occasionally seen shooting off the asteroid, falling back and sometimes ricocheting off again in a cosmic game of ping-pong.\n\nWith so much rough terrain, engineers scrambled to aim for a tighter spot than originally anticipated. Nightingale Crater, the prime target, appears to have the biggest abundance of fine grains, but boulders still abound, including one dubbed Mount Doom.\n\nThen COVID-19 struck.\n\nThe team fell behind and bumped the second and final touch-and-go dress rehearsal for the spacecraft to August. That pushed the sample grab to October.\n\n“Returning a sample is hard,” said NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. “The COVID made it even harder.”\n\nOsiris-Rex has three bottles of nitrogen gas, which means it can touch down three times — no more.\n\nThe spacecraft automatically will back away if it encounters unexpected hazards like big rocks that could cause it to tip over. And there’s a chance it will touch down safely, but fail to collect enough rubble.\n\nIn either case, the spacecraft would return to orbit around Bennu and try again in January at another location.\n\nWith the first try finally here, Lauretta is worried, nervous, excited “and confident we have done everything possible to ensure a safe sampling.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/19"}]}

We took the decision that we didn’t want him near the charity.” Savile had appeared on the programme in 1984, 1987 and 1989, before Jones became chair.\n\nFollowing Savile’s death, inquiries were held into the culture at the BBC. Two “damning” reports published in February 2016 found that serious failings at the corporation had enabled Savile to sexually abuse around 100 people “without detection for decades”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe reports found that BBC staff were “more worried about reputation than the safety of children” and that although the criminal behaviour was largely the fault of the perpetrator, the corporation “could have stopped it but failed to do so”.\n\nHowever, the reports also said there was no evidence that the BBC as a corporate body was aware of Savile’s abuse.\n\nConservative Party\n\nBlame has also been laid at the door of the Conservative Party for not only letting Savile get away with decades of abuse, but also for entrenching his status in society and making him feel increasingly untouchable.\n\nIn July 2013, the BBC reported that senior civil servants had repeatedly warned Margaret Thatcher against giving Savile a knighthood in the 1980s.\n\nHeavily redacted documents revealed that the then prime minister had written to Robert Armstrong, the most senior civil servant in the country at the time, making the case for Savile’s knighthood in 1983. But Armstrong “vetoed the idea, saying it was too soon after ‘unfortunate revelations’ in which the entertainer had boasted to the media of having sex with women he met while running charity marathons”, reported the BBC.\n\nSavile was ultimately knighted in 1990, weeks after Thatcher was forced to resign as PM. Documents revealed a series of communications between the two during Thatcher’s time in power: she invited him to Chequers in the 1980s and regularly attended his New Year’s Eve parties.\n\nThe police\n\nThe police have been accused of missing many opportunities to bring Savile to justice during his lifetime. As early as the 1980s, a woman “reported she’d been assaulted in Savile’s camper-van in a BBC car park”, reported Politics.co.uk in 2013.\n\nIn 2003, a victim told officers at a West London police station that she’d been “touched inappropriately” by Savile on Top of the Pops in 1973. She only wanted to proceed if other victims had come forward – but the police had lost the original report from the 1980s, so “the matter was left to rest”.\n\nFurther allegations were made between 2007 and 2009, and Savile’s name came up as part of the police’s three-year probe into abuse at the Haut de la Garenne children’s home in Jersey. Savile was investigated but never charged, as “the evidence did not seem to stack up at the time”, said The Guardian.\n\nA report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in 2013 found that “numerous police failings” left Savile free to sexually abuse “hundreds of young people over five decades”. The disgraced presenter “could have been stopped as early as 1964 but police mishandled evidence and dismissed victims”, the same paper reported.\n\nPolice failings were compounded by the fact that Savile’s victims felt unable to come forward and report the abuse, a major contributing factor to this being his celebrity status.\n\nIt took “a pervert as monstrous as Jimmy Savile to change British cultural attitudes to child and sexual abuse”, said Politics.co.uk. “Now, at least, the chances are public horror about his activities will make it harder for future paedophiles to achieve what Savile should never have done: get away with it.”", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}]}

A few thousand at a time.”\n\nNew equipment has been installed, but it needs to be calibrated and tested so that it works in sync with the grid, Brooks said.\n\nAbout 35,000 customers in Moore County remained without power Tuesday afternoon, according to Brooks.\n\nThe mayor of Southern Pines, a town of about 15,900 residents situated in the county, called the attack a cruel and selfish act.\n\n“There are so many people that are hurting,” Mayor Carol Haney said on CNN on Monday. The revenue stream has been stopped. If you have health issues, it is critical. It is just a horrible, horrible, terrorist, in my opinion, act.”\n\nNo suspects or motives have been announced.\n\nAt Tuesday’s news conference, Moore County Chief Deputy Richard Maness had no major updates about the investigation but said a tip line has been “very, very active” in the past 24 hours.\n\nTom McInnis, the North Carolina Senate Majority Whip whose district includes Moore County, told reporters he is looking at potential legislation to modernize penalties for this kind of incident, which he said is something that has never happened in North Carolina.\n\nPharmacist storing prescription medicines at home\n\nThe outages have made life difficult for residents. Schools will be closed through Thursday, four days with no classes. Businesses without generators are shuttered. Residents without power must leave their homes for hot food and to charge their electronic devices.\n\nThe owner of a Moore County pharmacy is storing medicines in his home, which is powered by a generator, so that people can continue to get their prescriptions, he said.\n\nRob Barrett, the owner of Whispering Pines Prescription Shoppe, believes he has enough gas to keep the generator running, but the pharmacy faces other issues: Some employees have no gas to get to work, and there are communication issues.\n\nIn rural areas of the county, the loss of electricity has also impacted the water supply to families.\n\n“Rural communities rely on electricity a lot more than people realize,” Andrew Wilkins, whose parents own a farm in Whispering Pines, told CNN. “Many big cities don’t lose their water when the power goes out, but a lot of rural areas rely on a well for water.\n\n“My family draws their water from a well, so when the power goes out, the well stops and the water pressure drops and we slowly lose water.”\n\nResidents of Southern Pines have lunch Monday while the power is out in the area at Reds Food Truck Corner. Karl B DeBlaker/AP\n\nSouthern Pines, roughly a 40-mile drive northwest of Fayetteville and a 70-mile drive southwest of Raleigh, lost all power, according to Haney, the mayor. She said she had to get her 98-year-old mother out of the town and to Charlotte so she could be in a warm home.\n\nWith the power out, the town’s water and sewer system is operating on generator power, according to Southern Pines Fire and Rescue.\n\nThe town’s fire department has seen an increase in car crashes related to the lack of traffic lights, and more fires as people try to find alternate ways to heat their homes, Southern Pines Fire Chief Mike Cameron told CNN.\n\nThe fire department also is getting more medical calls from people using supplemental oxygen or other medical devices that require power, Cameron said.\n\nFirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital in Pinehurst is running on a backup generator. However, the hospital is postponing certain elective procedures, and family medicine and other clinics in the country will be closed until power service is restored, hospital officials said in a news release Sunday.\n\n‘A malicious, criminal attack on the entire community’\n\nInvestigators are “leaving no stone unturned to find out who did this,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday. FBI and state investigators have joined the investigation.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community that plunged tens of thousands of people into darkness,” Cooper said.\n\n“Our priorities now are health and safety, getting the power back on as quickly as possible, and making sure that federal, state and local law enforcement find out who did this, and why, and bring them to justice.”\n\nSeveral communities across the county began experiencing power outages just after 7 p.m. Saturday, the Moore County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nWhoever fired bullets at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields, the county sheriff, said Sunday.\n\nFields on Sunday noted “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it.”\n\nInvestigators were trying to determine whether both substations were fired at simultaneously, or one after the other, the sheriff said Monday.\n\nA countywide mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. has been in effect since Sunday night, with Fields saying the decision was made to protect residents and businesses.\n\nResidents fill gas containers Monday just outside the area impacted by the power outage. Karl B DeBlaker/AP\n\nCountry needs to have a serious conversation about infrastructure protection, governor says\n\nThe governor stressed Tuesday that the state needs to learn from the incident, saying “this is unacceptable to have this many people without power for this long.”\n\n“This is a retirement community, so there are a lot of adult care homes that do not have power,” Cooper told CNN on Tuesday. “We’re providing generators and help to make sure people are safe here.”\n\nThe country needs to have “a serious … conversation about protecting our critical infrastructure,” Cooper said.\n\n“It was clear that (whoever is behind the gunfire) knew how to cause significant damage, and that they could do it at this substation, so we have to reassess the situation,” Cooper said.\n\nOfficials are not disclosing whether there were cameras at the two affected substations, because that is “part of the investigation that they do not want to reveal at this time,” Cooper said.\n\nLess than two weeks before Saturday’s substation damage, the FBI said there had been an increase in reported threats to electric infrastructure from people who espouse “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideology.”\n\nThe FBI has received reports of threats to electric infrastructure by people espousing racially or ethnically motivated extremist ideology “to create civil disorder and inspire further violence,” the FBI said in a November 22 bulletin sent to private industry, which CNN obtained.\n\nThough the motives for Saturday’s damage still are unclear, US officials have consistently been concerned by the interest violent extremists have shown in the country’s electric grid.\n\nCooper said Tuesday he was aware of the FBI warning.\n\n“Matter of fact, we have worked to organize and step up our protection of our infrastructure, particularly in the area of cyber security. We know that those attacks can be massive and put down power or water or other infrastructure for a lot of people across the country, so we’ve been working on that,” Cooper said.", "authors": ["Steve Almasy Jason Hanna Amanda Musa", "Steve Almasy", "Jason Hanna", "Amanda Musa"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/10/israeli-palestinian-conflict-how-to-help/71125353007/", "title": "Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Groups offering help to those in need", "text": "Thousands of people have been killed and wounded amid intense fighting in the Gaza Strip after Hamas militant groups launched an unprecedented assault over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired thousands of rockets and sent about 1,000 gunmen from Gaza to Israel. In response, the Israeli Defense Forces retaliated with airstrikes and rocket attacks inside the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe fighting between Israeli and Palestinian militants is among the most violent in years, marking the latest clash in a conflict that dates back to World War I. Israel formally declared war on Sunday and the country intensified its response the next day with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordering a \"complete siege\" on Gaza, cutting off electricity, food, fuel, and other supplies to more than 2 million Palestinians.\n\nThe war’s death toll climbed to nearly 1,600 on both sides on Monday, including about 900 in Israel and more than 680 in Gaza, home to 2.3 million Palestinians. Thousands have also been injured. And more than 123,000 people have been displaced in Gaza, according to a Monday report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nHumanitarians, aid groups, and public health experts have expressed growing concerns over humanitarian needs in the region and have called for an end to the violence.\n\nOn Monday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres sounded the alarm about the deteriorating situation and urged people to focus on civilians from both sides. Guterres pleaded for an end to \"the vicious cycle of bloodshed, hatred, and polarization,\" according to a U.N. news release.\n\n\"Humanitarian relief and essential supplies must be allowed to reach people in need, rapidly and without impediment,” OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told the Associated Press. “All parties must ensure freedom of movement for humanitarian workers.”\n\nSeveral organizations have warned of the potential of more lives lost and have also called for peace to help victims of the war. If you are looking for ways to help Israeli and Palestinian victims, here is a list of some organizations promoting peace and providing relief.\n\nHow to cope:The videos out of Israel, Gaza are graphic, but some can't look away\n\nAlliance for Middle East Peace\n\nThe Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of over 170 non-governmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building state peace between the two communities.\n\nOn Saturday, the coalition said it is working to support members assisting in emergency responses. \"We call for the immediate protection of civilian life, for urgent steps to be taken to de-escalate this situation, and for all actors to prevent this situation spiraling toward even further tragedy,\" ALLMEP said in a statement.\n\nAmerican Friends of the Parents Circle - Families Forum\n\nThe American Friends of the Parents Circle - Families Forum (AF-PCFF) is a grassroots organization that works to share narratives from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the U.S. public to foster a peace and reconciliation process. The organization supports the Parents Circle-Families Forum which is an Israeli-Palestinian organization of over 600 families who have all lost an immediate family member to the ongoing conflict.\n\nIn response to the attacks, the AF-PCFF reaffirmed its commitment to building and fostering peace for the future.\n\n\"Let us remember that violence begets violence, and the only way forward is through peaceful dialogue, diplomacy, and a commitment to finding common ground,\" the AF-PCFF said in a statement Sunday. \"It is a call to action for leaders, communities, and individuals alike to seek solutions that prioritize reconciliation, justice, and lasting peace.\"\n\nThe Carter Center\n\nFounded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter in partnership with Emory University, The Carter Center is a humanitarian aid organization that has been promoting peace and advocating for a viable two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades.\n\nAfter Israel declared war, The Carter Center released a statement condemning the targeting of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and called for international action to end the violence.\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a humanitarian organization that aims to protect victims of conflicts and provide them with assistance. The ICRC has been present in Israel and the occupied territories since 1967. The organization is asking for donations to improve access to essential services like water and to support livelihood projects.\n\n“All parties must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law. This is non-negotiable. Civilians and civilian objects must be respected and protected,\" Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement Saturday.\n\nDoctors Without Borders\n\nDoctors Without Borders is a non-governmental organization that describes itself as an \"independent, impartial and neutral\" charity that provides humanitarian aid to people affected by conflict, disease outbreaks, and natural and human-made disasters.\n\nWith thousands wounded by airstrikes, the organization reported overcrowding and supply shortages, including medical supplies, drugs, and power for generators, in Gaza. Medical staff are also facing dangerous conditions and are struggling to find safe ways to transport patients to hospitals, as ambulances have been hit by airstrikes.\n\n\"The situation is horrific, with massive Israeli and Palestinian casualties,\" Matthias Kannes, head of mission in Gaza, said in a statement. \"Our Palestinian colleagues are working day and night to cope with the influx of wounded.\"\n\nDoctors Without Borders is assisting with medical needs in the region by donating medical supplies to hospitals and health facilities while local staff are providing surgical and inpatient care.\n\nSave the Children\n\nSave the Children issued an emergency alert in response to the conflict, noting the \"escalating violence\" has put 1.2 million children in need of humanitarian aid. The international organization is demanding de-escalation and has called for peace talks.\n\nThe organization is providing assistance to children affected by the attacks, where many face dangerous conditions, and displacement and may suffer from \"serious mental health impacts.\"\n\nPalestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF)\n\nNational and international organizations that provide assistance to victims in the conflict include the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), which works to provide crucial and life-saving medical relief and humanitarian aid to conflict victims in Gaza. Before the conflict and now, access to essential resources like food, clean water, and healthcare has been severely limited.\n\n\"In light of the recent violence that has left hundreds dead and thousands injured and homeless in Gaza, we are mobilizing our resources in unwavering determination,\" the organization said on its website.\n\nContributing: Julie Garisto, Leesburg Daily Commercial; The Associated Press;", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/us/fbi-newark-threat-to-synagogues/index.html", "title": "NJ synagogue threat: FBI says person 'no longer poses a danger to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn individual has been identified and interviewed in connection with a broad threat to synagogues in New Jersey, according to law enforcement sources, and the FBI in Newark tweeted on Friday that the source of the threat “no longer poses a danger to the community.”\n\nThe person told authorities he does not like Jewish people and was very angry, but he indicated that he was not going to do anything harmful, the sources said.\n\nPolice officers stand watch outside the United Synagogue of Hoboken, New Jersey, on Thursday. Ryan Kryska/AP\n\nAn online posting with antisemitic comments in a forum frequented by extremists prompted an FBI alert Thursday night, CNN reported.\n\nAuthorities were alarmed because the posting was written as if an attack had already occurred, the sources explained. Similar writings have been posted by “active shooters” in incidents across the country just before their attacks.\n\nThat factored significantly into the urgency of locating him and also releasing the broad warning to the Jewish community, the sources said.\n\nThe online threat arrived at a moment of rising antisemitism in the US, as public incidents of bigotry have surfaced around the nation, from Florida to California.\n\n“Each and every law enforcement agency in New Jersey stood up yesterday to protect and communicate with our Jewish neighbors against hate,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement Friday. “From direct contact to synagogue leadership, to uniformed and non-uniformed police presences at places of worship, our State Police, federal partners, county prosecutor’s officers, local police departments, sheriffs and other law enforcement moved swiftly to protect synagogues and Jewish centers.”\n\n“While this immediate threat has been mitigated, we know that others may follow and we know that hate continues to fester,” the attorney general added.\n\nIt’s unclear at this time what, if any, charges the individual connected to the New Jersey synagogues threat will face.\n\nCNN has contacted the FBI for comment.\n\n‘Credible information of a broad threat’\n\nOn Thursday, the FBI in Newark tweeted it had received “credible information of a broad threat to synagogues” in the state.\n\n“We ask at this time that you take all security precautions to protect your community and facility. We will share more information as soon as we can. Stay alert. In case of emergency call police,” the post said.\n\nIn a second tweet, the agency said it was taking a “proactive measure” with that warning, while “investigative processes are carried out.”\n\nWhile no specific target, timing or plan was mentioned, the nature of the post created enough concern that the FBI decided to put a general warning out of an abundance of caution, the law enforcement sources said.\n\nPart of that concern, the sources added, comes because of previous mass killings involving extremists who posted on social media, including the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue killings, the deadliest attack on Jewish people on US soil; the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, the deadliest attack on Latinos in modern US history; and the May massacre at a Buffalo supermarket, an attack which officials said was racially motivated.\n\nThursday evening, the FBI said it takes all threats seriously and was working with law enforcement to investigate the threat and was also “engaged with our faith based partners in the affected community.”\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday, “This remains a tense time for our Jewish communities who are facing a wave of anti-Semitic activity.”\n\nMurphy said he was grateful to the FBI and other law enforcement partners “for their tireless efforts in mitigating the immediate threat to our Jewish synagogues.”\n\n“We will remain vigilant. We will take any and every threat with the utmost seriousness and we will stand up and stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish congregations.”\n\nAdvice from a security company\n\nThe president of a company that provides security for hundreds of Jewish houses of worship and schools in the New Jersey and New York area has sent out guidance to clients to ask for additional security from law enforcement, he told CNN.\n\nSynagogues should contact local law enforcement and “request not just increased patrols but actual manpower during prayers and other activities,” said Joshua Gleis, of Gleis Security Consulting.\n\nGleis also advised synagogues not to conduct outdoor activities until further notice and to pull down exterior shades.\n\nHe also advised Jewish schools in the area to take similar actions until more information is available, as “any credible threat to a Jewish synagogue can become one to a Jewish school or community center.”\n\nThe NYPD also said Thursday its Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureaus were working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI to “ensure the safety and well-being of every area that encompasses our Jewish citizens and synagogues here in New York City and the tri-state area.”\n\nOver the past few years, the US has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents, with 941 incidents in 2015 jumping to 2,717 tracked in 2021 by the Anti-Defamation League. On Thursday, the ADL said it was working with the FBI to address the credible threat and advised synagogues and Jewish organizations to “remain calm and in heightened state of alert.”\n\nThe FBI’s warning on Thursday comes amid continued reports across the country of anti-Jewish bigotry, including multiple antisemitic messages that appeared in public spaces in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend, and a group of demonstrators who hung banners over a Los Angeles freeway earlier in October showing support for antisemitic comments that were made by Kanye West. Photos also showed the group with their arms raised in what appeared to be the Nazi salute. Los Angeles officials condemned the incident.\n\nWest previously made a series of antisemitic outbursts, notably on October 8, when he tweeted he was “going death con 3 [sic] On JEWISH PEOPLE,” and also that, “You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda,” without specifying what group he was addressing, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine records pulled by CNN.\n\nHis tweet was removed and Twitter locked his account. In an interview conducted after the controversial tweet, West told Piers Morgan that he was sorry for the people that he hurt but said he didn’t regret making the remark.", "authors": ["John Miller Rob Frehse Christina Maxouris", "John Miller", "Rob Frehse", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/asia/north-korea-missiles-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "North Korea fired the highest number of short-range missiles in a ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nThe South Korean military said Wednesday North Korea launched the highest number of short-range missiles in a day as Seoul retaliated to Pyongyang’s latest barrage of weapons tests, further escalating tensions in the region.\n\nNorth Korea fired as many as 23 missiles of different types to the east and west of the Korean Peninsula, including a surface-to-air missile into the waters off the east and west coasts of the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.\n\nOne of the missiles launched by Pyongyang was a short-range ballistic missile that landed close to South Korean territorial waters for the first time since the division of Korea, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.\n\nJCS said the missile landed in international waters 167 kilometers (104 miles) northwest of South Korea’s Ulleung island, about 26 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) – the de facto inter-Korean maritime border that North Korea does not recognize.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told journalists North Korea is firing missiles at an \"unprecedently high frequency\" in the wake of escalating tensions in the region. Kyodo/Reuters\n\nJapan’s Defense Ministry said North Korea conducted another launch later on Wednesday, including at least one more ballistic missile toward the east that has fallen into the sea outside of Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\nThe ballistic missile flew a short distance at a maximum altitude of less than 50 km, Toshiro Ino, the deputy minister of defense, told reporters on Wednesday evening local time.\n\n“North Korea has rapidly escalated its provocations, launching more than a dozen missiles today alone and reportedly firing more than 100 artillery shells into the Japan sea since announcing an extremely provocative statement earlier in the day” Ino said.\n\nNo damage to aircraft or vessels has been confirmed as of now.\n\nWhen asked whether North Korea had in the past launched this many missiles throughout a day, Ino told reporters that in 2006 and 2009 the North had fired several missiles throughout the day from 3 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time, and 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time, respectively, without mentioning an exact number of missiles.\n\nA South Korean defense official said earlier the missiles landed to the west of the peninsula in the Yellow Sea, known as the West Sea in Korea, and to the east in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.\n\nAn air raid warning on Ulleung island, located about 120 kilometers east of the peninsula, was lifted about 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North Korean test was an “effective territorial encroachment.”\n\nAt an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting, Yoon “ordered that a stern response be swiftly taken so that North Korea’s provocation pays a clear price,” according to South Korea’s presidential office.\n\nIn an immediate response, South Korea launched three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets on Wednesday morning, according to JCS.\n\nJCS said the South Korean Air Force targeted international waters north of the NLL at an equal distance to that which the North Korean missile had earlier landed south of the line.\n\n“Our military’s precise strike showed our will to firmly respond to any North Korean provocations including short-range ballistic missile, and our capability and readiness to precisely target the enemy,” JCS said.\n\nNorth Korea is “fully responsible” for the situation as they are the ones continuing to provoke despite warnings, JCS added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that North Korea is launching missiles at an “unprecedentedly high frequency.”\n\nKishida also called for a National Security Council meeting to be held as soon as possible due to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n“North Korea’s unprecedented launch of multiple ballistic missiles is recklessly threatening the security of the Republic of Korea,” Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Penny Wong, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n“Pyongyang must cease this action,” she added.\n\nSouth Korea responded to North Korea's barrage of missiles on Wednesday by firing three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets.

The strikes also caused major damage to power systems across Ukraine, forcing people to reduce consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts.\n\nPutin said that while he did not regret the strikes and believes that Russia’s actions were correct, he did recognize that “what is happening now is unpleasant.”\n\nPutin also defended his partial mobilization of Russians that began in September, telling reporters it is expected to end in two weeks and that some 222,000 troops had already been drafted into the army.\n\nThe mobilization got off to a chaotic start last month, sparking rare protests throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of people – mostly fighting-age men – fled Russia, pouring into neighboring countries like Georgia and Kazakhstan to avoid conscription.\n\nPutin also said that Russia does not seek to “destroy” Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders have previously alleged. His comments come seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion and as Moscow attempts to annex four Ukrainian regions in violation of international law.\n\nThe Russian leader was speaking at a rare news conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, where Putin had traveled for a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a regional intergovernmental organization made up of former Soviet states.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the signing ceremony with separatist leaders in Moscow on September 30 Contributor/Getty Images\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with US President Joe Biden, Putin told a reporter that he “does not see the need for negotiations.”\n\nBiden was asked a similar question in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this week. The US President said he did not see “any rationale” for meeting his Russian counterpart, though he said he would perhaps make an exception to discuss the fate of imprisoned American basketball star Brittney Griner.\n\nRussian setbacks in Kherson\n\nRussian authorities said civilian evacuations would begin Friday in the occupied southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, where the Kremlin has suffered a string of defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces.\n\nFurther to the east, Russia’s embattled forces have managed to make some small gains in Donetsk, toward the city of Bakhmut, aided in large measure by Wagner mercenaries, or private military contractors. Moscow likely views the city a jumping-off point toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – the largest urban areas held by Ukraine in Donetsk, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nBakhmut is currently under Ukrainian control, but it has been bombarded by Russian artillery for months. Reports from pro-Russian analysts and in Russian state media alleged that Kyiv had begun withdrawing some forces from the city, but CNN could not independently verify those claims. Ukrainian officials have not commented on them, but they have noted that Bakhmut is being fiercely contested.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook for Russian forces in Kherson and the northeastern region of Luhansk remain bleak. Kyiv has continued to make significant gains along the western side of the Dnipro River, a major waterway that flows across Ukraine and Eastern Europe, as they push toward the city of Kherson.\n\nA man walks near anti-tank obstacles in the frontline town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region on Tuesday.

Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in Kherson, said Moscow’s forces were “courageously and professionally holding back the daily attempts of the militants of the Kyiv regime to break through the defenses.”\n\nThough Stremousov said civilians should be at a “safe distance from the hostilities” and that Kherson residents appeared to have begun evacuating. The governor of the eastern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, said Thursday that local authorities were preparing to receive residents of Kherson fleeing the front lines, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Golubev said the first group of evacuees would arrive on Friday.\n\nGolubev’s comments came after Russia’s deputy prime minister confirmed Moscow would assist with evacuation efforts, heeding calls from the head of the Kremlin-backed administration in Kherson who had pleaded for help.\n\nA destroyed apartment remains is seen Tuesday in Bakhmut. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere is now concern that Ukrainian citizens in occupied territory may be forced to go to Russian territory against their will. Reports emerged early in the war of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly sent to so-called “filtration centers” before being moved to Russia. Moscow denounced the claims as lies, alleging that Ukraine has hindered its efforts to “evacuate” people to Russia. But allegations of these centers stirred painful memories of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s forced deportation of millions from their homelands.\n\nOver the summer, Ukrainian officials in the contested region of Zaporizhzhia appealed to citizens who were in Russian-occupied territory to move away from front lines and into other Ukrainian-controlled territory. If that option was not possible, they advised Ukrainians to use Crimea or Russian territory as a transit route toward Ukraine or a friendly country.\n\nThose on the frontlines in Kherson are now being advised by Ukrainian officials to avoid traveling to Russia altogether.\n\n“Under no circumstances should you go to the Russian Federation,” warned Oleksandr Samoylenko, a top Ukrainian official in the Kherson region, on Friday. Samoylenko said that Ukrainian forces were only targeting Russian positions and equipment using high-precision weapons.\n\nSamoylenko’s and his deputy, Yurii Sobolevskyi, both accused Russia of trying to Ukrainian citizens out of the region so they could repopulate it with “zombies who are 100% loyal to Moscow.” Sobolevskyi alleged that a similar scheme was carried out in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nKherson is one of four regions Russia is now attempting to annex from Ukraine.

Baderkhan Ahmad/AP\n\nThe SDF, which oversee Ghweran prison, said the ISIS fighters struck local forces standing guard outside, while the militants inside burned blankets and plastic items “in an attempt to create chaos.” The Kurdish-led forces, a key US partner in the fight against ISIS, said they “thwarted” the attempted jailbreak hours after it began.\n\nHowever, clashes were still ongoing near the facility until Wednesday, when the group’s spokesman, Farhad Shami, said that all ISIS fighters and prisoners had surrendered.\n\nThere was “mass surrendering of ISIS prisoners,” Shami added.\n\nHe also shared videos on Twitter which appeared to show hundreds of prisoners in orange jumpsuits gathered in a courtyard, with the walls behind them blackened from the fighting.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Tuesday that the US-led coalition had moved in armored Bradley fighting vehicles to support the SDF, indicating that US ground forces were involved in the fight. The Bradleys were being used to help establish an inner and an outer perimeter around the prison facility, while the SDF closed in on ISIS fighters, according to US military officials.\n\n“We have provided limited ground support, strategically positioned to assist security in the area,” John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in Washington.\n\nThis photo provided by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces shows some ISIS fighters who were arrested. Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces via AP\n\nCoalition forces also supported the operation with airstrikes, including the precision targeting of ISIS fighters who were attacking SDF positions from the cover of nearby buildings.\n\nNo US service members were injured during the fighting, a defense official said, although the SDF suffered some losses. Dozens of fighters with the SDF and ISIS are estimated to have been killed in the fighting.\n\nOperation Inherent Resolve (OIR), the US-led coalition mission to defeat ISIS, said in a statement Tuesday that the recent ISIS escape attempt “will not pose a significant threat to Iraq or the region.” It added that assessments are ongoing to see if ISIS is planning any future attacks on Ghweran or other prison facilities throughout Syria or Iraq.\n\n“Due to its severely degraded capability, Daesh’s future survival is dependent on its ability to refill its ranks through poorly-conceived attempts like the Hasakah attack,” said Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan, Jr., the commander of the OIR Combined Joint Task Force.\n\nSome 11,000 to 12,000 ISIS fighters are held in northern Syria in prisons and detention camps run by the SDF.\n\nWhile this is not the first such prison break attempt – several escaped from the same facility in 2020 by ripping off doors and using them to destroy a wall – concerns are mounting that the timing and audacity of the attack may indicate the terror group’s renewed strength.\n\nAlthough there is little fear that ISIS will reclaim its former physical territory, which, at its peak, stretched from the outskirts of Baghdad to western Syria and encompassed more than 10 million people, the terror group has been mobilizing thousands of its remaining fighters in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, just as US-backed forces retook the final ISIS stronghold in Syria, and only a year after Iraq declared victory against the group, intelligence sources and international monitors were already noticing an increase in ISIS activity and attacks in the region.\n\nA wide-ranging report released in 2020 by the UN Monitoring Team, which tracks the global jihadi terror threat, warned that ISIS was beginning to reassert itself in Iraq and Syria. It said the group was “mounting increasingly bold insurgent attacks, calling and planning for the breakout of ISIL [ISIS] fighters in detention facilities and exploiting weaknesses in the security environment of both countries.”\n\nIn recent months, Iraqi security forces and commanders have also warned that ISIS sleeper cells are continuing to stage attacks.\n\nFollowing a deadly ambush on an Iraqi military post near Baghdad last Friday, Iraqi President Barham Salih tweeted: “Certainly, the attempts to revive terrorism in the region cannot be underestimated.”", "authors": ["Hamdi Alkhshali Kareem Khadder Eliza Mackintosh", "Hamdi Alkhshali", "Kareem Khadder", "Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/atlanta-police-cop-city-terrorism/index.html", "title": "Five people arrested on domestic terrorism charges in clash at ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFive people were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism in Atlanta on Tuesday after a clash between activists and law enforcement at a site set to be turned into a state-of-the-art training facility for police, state investigators said.\n\nThe planned $90 million, 85-acre Atlanta Public Safety Training Center is to be built in a forested area of Dekalb County that used to be a prison farm.

But the terror group remains a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJust two days after the leader of ISIS killed himself during a US raid in northern Syria, a United Nations report says the terror group is far from vanquished. In fact, it remains a potent force in Iraq and Syria, with a growing presence in Afghanistan and West Africa, according to the UN analysis.\n\nThe report – compiled by UN experts on ISIS and al Qaeda and covering the last six months of 2021 – says ISIS may still have up to $50 million in its coffers. It was completed before the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi on Wednesday.\n\nEven before his demise, according to the UN experts, ISIS had lost several important members of its senior echelon. And yet the group remains a continuing threat. Instability in both Iraq and Syria “indicate that an eventual ISIL resurgence in the core region cannot be ruled out,” the report concludes, referring to the group by its alternate acronym.\n\nIn a wide-ranging document, the UN monitors also say there’s no evidence the Taliban is trying to limit the activities of foreign terrorists in Afghanistan. “On the contrary, terrorist groups enjoy greater freedom there than at any time in recent history,” they add.\n\nIn its assessment of the situation in Iraq and Syria, the report says ISIS “is estimated to retain between 6,000 and 10,000 fighters across both countries, where it is forming cells and training operatives to launch attacks,” often using desert hideouts.\n\nIt states that the group “has evolved into a primarily rural insurgency, withstanding sustained counter-terror pressure” from forces in Iraq and Syria, which include US forces deployed in northern Syria as well as the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe UN analysis says that in Iraq, ISIS continued in the second half of 2021 “to launch attacks at a steady rate, including hit-and-run operations, ambushes and roadside bombs,” especially in a swathe of territory north of Baghdad. “Cells in Iraq also focus on economic warfare, targeting infrastructure, in particular power lines,” it adds.\n\nThe UN monitors assess that ISIS is also rebuilding in the far west of Iraq, including “strongholds and tunnels with many sleeper cells and hundreds of fighters in the Anbar desert.”\n\nThe report depicts a leadership living under deep cover. It says one government noted that Qurayshi – while thought to be somewhere in Syria – “takes extreme measures to ensure his security, allowing no electronics to be carried in his vicinity.” He was thought to be moving regularly between Syria and Iraq.\n\nDespite all his precautions, he was found in Idlib province, and now ISIS has a succession problem, for the second time in two years. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed – also in Idlib – in October 2019.\n\nEdmund Fitton-Brown, the monitoring team’s co-ordinator, told CNN that Qurayshi’s death was a “significant setback” to the group “coming as it does hard on the heels of the detention of his deputy and ISIS finance chief, Sami Jasim al al-Jaburi, which was announced by the Iraqi authorities last October.”\n\nFitton-Brown says ISIS’ top leadership “has suffered significant attrition in recent years and it’s not clear they can replace either man with leaders of similar caliber or experience.”\n\nThe UN report says the views of governments differ on the impact of this attrition. “Some member states assess that the group is significantly undermined by these losses, while others assess that the threat of a resurgence by the ISIL core remains.”\n\nThe complex ISIS attack aimed at freeing prisoners in Hasakah in northern Syria last month may hint at that resurgence. Fitton-Brown says it was a significant development and some important prisoners were freed. Others were killed or recaptured, but, he adds, “they will consider the disruption and propaganda to have been worth that price, but it’s too early to say what it tells us about, or what impact it will have on – the group’s capabilities.”\n\nMembers of the Syrian Democratic Forces are seen around a prison in Syria's northeastern city of Hasakah on January 25. AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe UN report says that ISIS’ war chest is significantly less than when its self-declared caliphate ruled large parts of Syria and Iraq. However, it’s far from penurious. “Funds assessed as being available to ISIL in the core of the conflict zone are holding steady at between $25 million and $50 million, with much of it assessed to remain in Iraq,” the report states. However, governments believe the group is now consistently spending more than it takes in.\n\nSome of that cash is being funneled to Afghanistan, where the UN experts believe that the ISIS affiliate (ISIS-K) is recruiting and expanding. In recent months, the group has released regular videos of its attacks on Taliban officials and fighters, in both eastern Afghanistan and the capital. ISIS-K carried out the devastating suicide attack at Kabul airport in August, in which more than 170 people were killed, and several subsequent assaults.\n\nThe report says ISIS-K “has demonstrated a continuing ability to mount sophisticated attacks, adding to the complexity of the security situation in Afghanistan.”\n\nUN member states assess that the strength of ISIS-K has now risen from earlier estimates of 2,200 to approaching 4,000, following the release of several thousand prisoners. One member state assessed that up to half of ISIS-K is composed of foreign terrorist fighters.\n\nThe UN team says that after six months of Taliban rule, “Afghanistan has the potential to become a safe haven for Al-Qaida and a number of terror groups with ties to the Central Asia region and beyond.” It notes that some of al Qaeda’s “closest sympathizers within the Taliban now occupy senior positions in the new de facto Afghan administration,” and confirms the return to Afghanistan of a former senior aide to the deceased al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nCentral Asian terror groups such as Islamic Jihad Group and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan “are now experiencing greater freedom of movement in the country,” the report says. “Central Asian embassies based in Afghanistan have observed with concern that several leaders of those groups have travelled freely to Kabul.”\n\nIn their section on jihadi activity in Africa, the UN monitors note that “Al-Qaida and ISIL affiliates in West Africa appear to have made decisive progress by exploiting local grievances, overwhelming stretched security forces and navigating complex interrelationships between armed groups.”\n\nThe strength of the al Qaeda affiliate in Mali is such that “the capital city itself is under threat, with a security bubble now limited to a 40-kilometre circle around Bamako,” according to several governments.\n\nLooking further ahead, the report raises the specter of a new generation of terrorists emerging from the refugee camps of northern Syria. One of those camps, al-Hawl, contains some 60,000 people, and the UN report assesses it is under “ISIS’ social control.”\n\n“Remaining stranded in harsh conditions, surrounded by radicalizing influences, may cause younger residents, especially, to become hardened and trained extremists,” says the UN report.\n\n“A generation of children, many raised in incubators of violent extremism, are at particular risk,” the UN experts conclude.", "authors": ["Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/12/israel-war-hamas-gaza-live-updates/71151815007/", "title": "Israel war news updates: Israel orders the evacuation of Gaza City", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the Israel-Hamas war from Thursday, Oct. 12.

Those conditions won't improve until Hamas militants free the approximately 150 hostages captured in the weekend assault, Israel officials said. Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gaza, and Egypt has enforced a blockade. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade, restricting the passage of people and goods in and out of the territory,\n\n“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.\n\nAids organizations are warning of a humanitarian crisis as resources become increasingly scarce, and what's available is hard to access because of airstrikes that have involved 6,000 munitions, according to the Israeli military.\n\n“We can’t flee because anywhere you go, you are bombed,” Khalil Abu Yahia said from a refugee camp in north Gaza. “You need a miracle to survive here.”\n\n$6 billion in unfrozen funds not released to Iran for now\n\nIran, long a financial and military supporter of Hamas but not directly linked so far to Saturday's attacks, won't have access for a while to the $6 billion unfrozen by the U.S. as part of a prisoner exchange last month.\n\nThe U.S. has reached a deal with Qatar, where the funds are held, not to release them for the time being, a U.S. official said Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration has being criticized for the agreement with Iran, which freed five detained Americans, and Hamas' weekend onslaught in Israel has only sharpened Republican rebukes.

He said Hamas, instead of promoting the well-being of Gazans, rules repressively and funnels resources to \"terror tunnels and rockets.\"\n\nBlinken said the Israeli government shared photos and videos of Hamas' atrocities and called them \"overwhelming.''\n\n\"A baby, an infant, riddled with bullets.

Israel has sought missile interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system, precision-guided munitions and artillery shells. Shipments from Pentagon supplies are expected to be continuous, the official said.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. military continued to build a “massive amount” of firepower in the Middle East this week as a warning to adversaries not to attack Israel, the official said.

He lived at kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, two daughters, and 400 others until it was decimated by the militant group, leaving only around 160 people alive and accounted for.\n\n“This is so unfathomable,” said Kaye, a resident of Sarasota, Florida who was traveling when she learned of the assault.\n\nDekel-Chen, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, is among an estimated 130 missing Israelis following the attacks.\n\nAccording to his family, he sent his wife and children to the house’s bomb shelter while he confronted the attackers upstairs.

With no information about her stepson's whereabouts, Kaye said spreading the word is the only course of action.\n\n“We do what needs to get done,” Kaye said. “And what needs to get done is to do everything possible to get Sagui home.”\n\n− Heather Bushman, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nFBI provides expertise in finding hostages\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department has been working with families of missing Americans to locate their loved ones, including those taken hostage.

On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says Saturday's attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel, the blood enemy of Hamas. The attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nBy land, sea, air and online:How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian enclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since Israel was founded in 1948 and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip. Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem. Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. Prompted by the Holocaust, the UN United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish.\n\nWar quickly broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, leading to Israeli expansion three-quarters of Palestinian mandate territory. Over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N. Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories that had been sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. But Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/middleeast/israeli-military-raid-west-bank-intl/index.html", "title": "Israeli military raid in West Bank: One man killed, two journalists ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Palestinian man was killed and two journalists shot and injured by Israeli forces during an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian authorities said Wednesday.\n\nThe man who was killed was 21, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Israeli military alleged that he was shooting at soldiers during the raid, which took place in the village of Deir al-Hatab near Nablus.\n\nThe two journalists injured were identified as photojournalists Mahmoud Fawzy and Louay Samhan who work for the Palestinian Authority television network Palestine TV, Palestinian authorities said.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said that the cause of their injuries is “unknown.”\n\nVideo from the scene where the two journalists were shot show the two men and their colleagues in a building wearing protective helmets and vests with PRESS labels.\n\nOne of the journalists appears to be climbing in from a window or opening with an injury to the leg before being assisted by colleagues. Another journalist lays across stairs with what appears to be an injury to his arm before he is also assisted up by colleagues out of the house and into an ambulance. The Palestinian Red Crescent said both are in stable condition.\n\nIn a statement, the IDF said they were in the village “to apprehend a terrorist suspected of involvement in carrying out the shooting attack at an Israeli bus and taxi adjacent to the city of Nablus last Sunday.”\n\nThe IDF said the suspect, identified by the IDF as an operative working for the Hamas militant group, barricaded himself in a residential building and shot at soldiers, who responded with “live fire toward the residence” as well as “fragmentation grenades and a bulldozer.” The suspect, identified as Salman Amran, was ultimately arrested, the IDF said.\n\nDuring the raid, the IDF said “shots were fired toward the soldiers from a number of sources. The soldiers responded with live fire toward the sources of the shooting. Hits on a number of armed Palestinians were identified and one assailant was killed as a result of the shooting.”\n\nRegarding the two journalists injured, the IDF said “we are aware of reports regarding two media workers who were in the area of the activity and got injured, the cause of the injury is unknown. We emphasize that the presence of uninvolved civilians in combat areas poses a life-threat.”\n\nUnusually, the raid took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest Jewish holiday when all of Israel, including the airports, completely shuts down.\n\nAhmad Assaf, General Supervisor of the Official Media for the Palestinian Authority, said the crew were in the village to cover the Israeli military raid and accused Israel of “incessant Israeli targeting of the Palestinian media, which did not stop for one day and aims to obscure the truth, bury it, and terrorize the Palestinian journalists.”\n\n“Despite the crimes of the occupation against the Palestinian media, we are determined to continue with our duty toward our people and their cause, expose the crimes of the occupation, and convey their voice to the world,” Assaf said.\n\nPalestinian Authority Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh in a statement accused Israel of “targeting journalists to keep their lenses away from the crime scene.”\n\nShtayyeh also accused Israel of a “systematic policy of killing and intimidation, without any consideration for international laws, taking advantage of the absence of accountability and impunity.”\n\nThe occupied West Bank, especially the areas of Jenin and Nablus, is in an increasingly volatile and dangerous situation, as near daily Israeli military operations clash with increasingly armed Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has been regularly raiding cities and villages in the occupied West Bank, saying it is targeting militants and their weapon caches before they have the chance to cross into Israel and carry out attacks. The operation, dubbed “Break the Wave” by the IDF, was launched after a series of attacks on Israelis. At least 20 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in attacks targeting civilians and soldiers in Israel and the West Bank so far this year.\n\nMore than 105 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces so far this year, making it the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied territories since 2015, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel says most Palestinians killed were engaging violently with soldiers during military operations, although dozens of unarmed civilians have been killed, human rights groups including B’Tselem have said.\n\nAl Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while also covering a military raid in Jenin in May. Like Fawzy and Samhan, Abu Akleh was wearing a protective helmet and vest with PRESS on the front and back.\n\nAlthough initially claiming Abu Akleh could have been killed by Palestinian militant fire, the IDF later admitted she was likely killed by an Israeli soldier by mistake who did not see that she was media.\n\nThe Palestinian Journalists Syndicate says so far this year there have been 80 cases of physical assault of Palestinian journalists and 35 injuries by bullets from Israeli forces.", "authors": ["Hadas Gold Abeer Salman", "Hadas Gold", "Abeer Salman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}]}

Conservative hardliners seeking to plot McCarthy’s ouster say otherwise.\n\nAnd what will happen if he can’t get 218 votes? No one knows.\n\n“You can’t beat somebody with nobody, and there’s nobody else running,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican who supports McCarthy for speaker. “Even if there was another announced candidate, that person would not be better positioned to get 218 than Kevin.”\n\nMcCarthy’s foes say another candidate will emerge and that talks have already begun to recruit a replacement. Some of Kevin McCarthy’s detractors have asked whether Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Tom Emmer of Minnesota would be willing to jump into the race, according to GOP sources familiar with the informal conversations. But all three men have made clear they’re backing McCarthy for speaker and wouldn’t challenge him for the job.\n\nIt’s still not known what would happen on Jan. 3 if McCarthy cannot get 218 votes to be elected speaker. But there’s an expectation that any number of Republicans could throw their hat into the ring if McCarthy stumbles or drops out.\n\n“There’s quality candidates who represent the conservative center of the Republican conference who are privately acknowledging that once it becomes clear it’s not going to Kevin McCarthy, they are interested in becoming speaker,” said Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who’s one of the handful of conservative hardliners publicly saying they are “hard no” votes against McCarthy. “And there are members who would excite the base, who would excite Republicans across the country, unite Republicans across the country as candidates, but they’re not going to raise their hand publicly until it’s clear to them that it’s not Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nIf McCarthy loses more than four GOP votes on January 3, he is expected to fall under the 218 votes he would need to claim the speakership. Then the House would keep voting until someone wins a majority of support from the members in attendance who are choosing a specific candidate and not voting “present.” If that happens, McCarthy insists he still won’t drop out.\n\n“Oh yeah, I’ll take the speaker’s fight to the floor,” McCarthy told CNN.\n\nMcCarthy also said he was willing to go through as many rounds of voting on the floor as it takes, predicting: “I’ll get there.”\n\nMeanwhile, the California Republican’s fiercest detractors are also digging in.\n\nMembers of the hardline House Freedom Caucus met with the chamber’s parliamentarian on Wednesday in order to get a briefing on the floor rules and procedures that dictate the process for the speakership vote. And some of McCarthy’s foes are reiterating their pledge to oppose him on the floor and calling on the GOP leader to drop out of the race now so they can start the search for a serious alternative.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analysis: One of Trump's biggest defenders thinks he has a chance to lead the RNC 04:02 - Source: CNN\n\n“He can avoid it now,” said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a former co-chair of the Freedom Caucus who lost to McCarthy for his conference’s nomination to be speaker, of a potential floor fight. “He doesn’t have the votes. We can move to different candidates. I’m willing to entertain anyone else.”\n\nThe commitment from both camps to take the speakership battle to January is shaping up to be a political game of chicken, with both sides signaling they’re willing to call the other’s bluff. But most Republicans are hoping it won’t come to that, worrying it would set the wrong tone as they enter into power and prepare for a tough two years of governing while working to protect their narrow majority.\n\n“I don’t want to see that happen. I can’t guarantee that not happening right now,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump ally who is backing McCarthy, said of a speaker showdown on the floor. “But the goal is to stop that from happening, to get everybody on the same page, and create unity so that we’re ready from day one.”\n\nAdded Tennessee Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, another McCarthy backer: “My hope is that we have unity and get this done on the first ballot, but we’ll see. … I’m hoping and praying for unity.”\n\nSome Republicans think the hardliners are bluffing.\n\n“Maybe they’re just trying to promote themselves a little bit?” said Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana, adding that conservative members’ views behind closed doors are more collegial than they may be publicly.\n\nAsked if he could instead vote for McCarthy’s No. 2, Scalise, for speaker, Pence said: “I’m voting for Kevin McCarthy. He’s gonna win.”\n\nTension builds in GOP Conference\n\nThe last time a vote for speaker had to go to multiple ballots was in 1923. And the longest time in history it took to elect a speaker lasted two months, with a total of 133 ballots.\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker on the floor.\n\n“Having a challenge on the floor is never going to be positive and really turn the floor over the Democrats,” McCarthy told reporters this week.\n\nBiggs, however, brushed off that possibility. And most Republicans don’t see it as a serious threat, though they privately acknowledge the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots.\n\n“I don’t buy it,” Biggs said. “Name the Democrat that a Republican would vote for.”\n\nSome moderates and mainstream Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with their colleagues’ threats to cause chaos on the floor. And some of them have a warning of their own: if the vote goes to a second ballot or more, they plan to just keep voting for McCarthy – potentially foiling the anti-McCarthy group’s plans to force him out of contention in the hopes of getting lawmakers to rally around an alternative.\n\n“Many of us are perturbed. We took a vote and McCarthy got 85%,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a district that Joe Biden carried in 2020, referring to the internal GOP election when Republicans backed McCarthy to be their nominee. “The right thing to do is coalesce around someone who has broad support. To do otherwise weakens the conference and hurts the team.”\n\nA group of mainstream House Republicans, known as the Republican Governance Group, sent a letter to their GOP colleagues on Friday urging them to unite behind McCarthy for speaker and warning that a floor fight over choosing their next leader could undermine the GOP as they enter the majority.\n\n“Such quarrels will only delay our ability to establish a working majority in the People’s House, which is critically important to successfully countering a Democrat-controlled Senate and Executive Branch,” the lawmakers wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN. “But make no mistake, we will not allow this conference to be dragged down a path to a paralyzed House that weakens our hard-fought majority.”\n\nThe letter, which is signed by 21 Republicans, also notes that while Republicans won the House, voters handed them power “skeptically” – a nod to the fact they only will have a razor-thin majority next year.\n\nRep. Dave Joyce of Ohio, who chairs the Republican Governance Group, said in a statement to CNN: “This Conference cannot handcuff itself to a burning building before we gavel in the 118th Congress. We are the dealmakers without whom this legislative body cannot govern, and we intend to provide the American people with a working majority.”\n\nSo far, at least five House Republicans have vowed to oppose McCarthy for speaker – a problem for him since he likely can only afford to lose four GOP lawmakers – though some of them have expressed openness to negotiating.\n\nMcCarthy’s foes say he has a much bigger problem.\n\n“Well, I think it’s a much larger number than people realize,” Good said of the McCarthy “no” votes. “My hope would be that more of them will start to come out publicly. So it just becomes increasingly clear that he doesn’t have the votes and we need to consider other candidates.”\n\nTheir efforts to recruit a viable alternative have been unsuccessful thus far. Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, has repeatedly said on the record he is supporting McCarthy and is looking forward to serving as majority leader next year.\n\nJordan, a McCarthy ally and co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he is not interested in the speaker’s gavel and just wants to be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and wouldn’t entertain questions about a hypothetical scenario in which McCarthy can’t get the necessary support to secure the speaker’s gavel. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has openly campaigned for Jordan to become speaker, told CNN he has asked Jordan to run “daily for two years.”\n\nAnd Emmer, who will serve as majority whip next year, said in a statement that “There is no one more deserving to lead House Republicans than Kevin McCarthy and he has my full support. Kevin has earned that right by raising hundreds of millions of dollars and helping Republicans win seats in back-to-back cycles.”\n\nTo win over holdouts, McCarthy has brokered negotiations on potential rules changes designed to empower rank-and-file members, such as enabling members to offer more amendments and giving them more notice before fast-tracked bills come to the floor.\n\nAnd McCarthy has also made public professions about what he would do as speaker, from dangling a potential impeachment inquiry over Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to threatening to investigate the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021 — both top priorities on the right.\n\n“We’ve got a long way to go,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, the current Freedom Caucus chief. But he added: “I think there is a burgeoning realization and acknowledgment that this place is broken. That’s a start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/politics/mccarthy-speaker-house-republicans-218/index.html", "title": "House Republicans brace for doomsday scenario if McCarthy falls ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs a right-wing faction threatens to tank his speakership ambitions, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy delivered a promise: “I’ll never leave,” making clear he has no plans to drop out of the race even if the fight goes to many ballots on the floor.\n\n“I’ll get 218,” McCarthy told CNN, referring to the votes he’d need to become House speaker.\n\nBut Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a conservative hardliner who is challenging McCarthy to be the most powerful member of Congress, doubled down on his commitment to stop the California Republican’s ascension.\n\n“I’m not bluffing,” Biggs told CNN on Thursday when asked if he would drop out.\n\nWith the increasing likelihood that the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots – something that hasn’t happened since 1923 – McCarthy’s allies and foes alike are starting to quietly game out the next steps if he can’t get the necessary 218 votes on the first round and they move into uncharted territory.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bash asks Pelosi if McCarthy has what it takes to be House Speaker. See her response 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nMcCarthy’s supporters are vowing to keep voting for him on multiple ballots, and GOP sources said there are early discussions about a floor strategy for that potential scenario, including whether to recess the House or let the votes keep rolling – no matter how long it takes.\n\nTo prevent that from happening, McCarthy and his team have been engaged in serious talks with a group of conservatives, including over potentially giving them influential committee assignments and more power to drive the legislative process. GOP sources said those negotiations are still early in the process and could ultimately end up giving the group some aspect of what the hardliners desperately want: additional power to seek a sitting speaker’s ouster with a vote on the floor.\n\nAsked if he would drop out of the race if he doesn’t get 218 votes on the first ballot, Biggs refused to say.\n\n“I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals,” said Biggs, who lost his conference’s nomination to become speaker last month after securing 31 votes.\n\nBut in the case of a doomsday scenario – where neither McCarthy nor Biggs can get 218 votes on January 3 and neither drops out – some pro-McCarthy Republicans are signaling support for a different approach. Some said they would be willing to work with Democrats to find a moderate Republican who can get the 218 votes to clinch the gavel – a long-shot idea that underscores the uncertainty looming over the speaker’s race.\n\n“Our initial plan is vote for Kevin and let him fight this out repeatedly. … But if they think they’re going to use this to infinity to drive him out, well, we’re not going to bend to their will,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican.\n\nBacon added if GOP hardliners don’t bend, then he would be willing to work with Democrats to find another more moderate Republican to secure the 218 votes to become speaker.\n\n“If a small group refuses to play ball and be part of the team, then we’ll work across the aisle to find an agreeable Republican,” Bacon said. “But I hope we don’t get there.”\n\nMcCarthy’s detractors don’t buy it.\n\n“There are very significant rules, changes being discussed that would open the House up, that would be transformative, that would give us the ability to actually legislate and represent our constituents,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida who said he’s a “hard no” on McCarthy. “And whoever is speaker is going to have to agree to those rules, I think. And I don’t think that person will be Kevin McCarthy because Kevin McCarthy won’t have 218 votes.”\n\nGaetz added: “I think the person who is ultimately going to be the speaker isn’t even the candidate yet.”\n\nIndeed, the small group of Republicans known as the “Never Kevin” movement – confident that Biggs could not win a majority of the House – has been trying to recruit a viable alternative, and claim “several” Republicans have privately told them they would be interested in running if McCarthy drops out. Their goal with voting for Biggs is to show that McCarthy is weak on the first ballot, which they hope would inspire other candidates to jump in.\n\n“How many members vote for someone else will show the strength (of the anti-McCarthy group),” Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who is a “hard no” on McCarthy, told CNN. “I think the second ballot is going to have more candidates. … There are already Republicans letting us know they’d like to be considered.”\n\nEven House Republicans who are supporting McCarthy predicted that a number of lawmakers would run if McCarthy withdrew his name, with some saying that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, would emerge as the front runner in that case.\n\n“If at some point, if Kevin did take his name out, then you would have good people (running). Scalise would probably be the guy,” one GOP lawmaker said.\n\nScalise has repeatedly vowed to support McCarthy and refused to speculate on whether he would jump into the race if the GOP leader can’t get the votes.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise told CNN. “Obviously, our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the conservative set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, went even further, ruling out jumping into the race even though Gaetz and other hardliners have urged him to seek the speakership.\n\n“No,” Jordan said when asked if he’d run if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes. “I want to chair the Judiciary Committee.”\n\nMcCarthy’s weighs more concessions\n\nWith 222 GOP seats next year, McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes and still win the speakership. But he and his team are still hopeful he can win on the first round as he has been working both publicly and privately to win over holdouts. So far, at least five Republicans have promised to oppose him on the floor – but in a positive sign for McCarthy, one of them has shown he’s gettable.\n\n“I will vote for Andy for speaker, subject to what we’re discussing,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican after leaving a meeting in McCarthy’s office on Wednesday. He later added: “All this is positive. We’re having good change, regardless of what happens. And you’ll see more of it.”\n\nIn addition to those five, a new group of seven Republican hardliners on Thursday laid out a list of conditions to earn their vote, although they did not specifically threaten to vote against McCarthy if their demands aren’t met.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he won't vote for McCarthy to become House Speaker 03:08 - Source: CNN\n\nTheir list of demands – which shows the work McCarthy needs to do to get to 218 – includes a promise that leaders won’t play in primaries, restoring the motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, placing more conservatives on key committees, giving members at least 72 hours to read bill text before a vote, and committing to using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to demand more spending cuts, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nMcCarthy has already begun brokering some rules changes to empower rank-and-file members, created a new select committee on China, vowed to boot some Democratic lawmakers from their committees, and sketched out in greater detail his investigative plans – including a potential impeachment inquiry into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nBut McCarthy still has additional levers he could pull. Conservative hardliners are pushing for more representation on the powerful House Rules Committee, a leadership-aligned panel that decides how and when bills come to the floor. In one private meeting with a member of the House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy was urged to take a harder public stance on the coming policy issues for next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd the anti-McCarthy group is also still pressing for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the “motion to vacate the chair,” and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a during a closed-door meeting last month. When asked by CNN on Thursday if he would visit the issue, McCarthy laughed and refused to answer.\n\nBut McCarthy’s detractors said it’s an issue very much still on the table and think he may end up needing to embrace it if he still doesn’t have the speaker votes by January 3. GOP sources told CNN there’s potential room to negotiate to give members more power to call for a vote to oust the speaker – perhaps by allowing the vote to occur if a certain number of members call for one, rather than allowing a single lawmaker to call for a vote as the hardliners want.\n\n“A competent secure leader is not threatened by (the motion to vacate),” Good said. “And so, yeah, that I think that’s central to many members.”\n\nYet others said what Good and his allies are seeking is a recipe for chaos — and are calling on their colleagues to fall in line.\n\n“I think that’s one of the reasons that we didn’t see a red wave … the idea that people are sick and tired of the noise, and they’re sick and tired of the fighting,” Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, said of the impact of a January 3 floor fight. “And I know I get that wherever I go in my district is, ‘why can’t you guys just get things done?’”\n\nAs McCarthy scrambles to lock down speaker’s votes, he also delayed the GOP’s internal elections for committee chairmanships. There was some speculation that one of the members competing for a gavel, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, may retire early if he doesn’t win, which would make McCarthy’s math problem even tougher. But Buchanan vehemently disputed the notion.\n\n“It’s ridiculous, laughable,” he told reporters. “I’m doing everything I can to help get Kevin to 218.”\n\nMcCarthy could also try to convince Democrats or his GOP detractors to vote present or not show up to the floor proceedings, which would lower the threshold he needs to become speaker. But McCarthy promised his GOP colleagues he would not court Democratic votes.\n\nCould Democrats join Republicans and select a speaker?\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been warning that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker.\n\nSome Democrats have said they would entertain the idea, including Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat from Texas who told CNN some of his GOP colleagues have approached him “informally” about it.\n\nJoyce also said some members have reached out to him about potentially running, but he dismissed it. “At the end of the day, Kevin’s going to be the new speaker.”\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the next House Democratic leader, said, “there are no behind-the-scenes conversations” that he has had with Republicans to put up an alternative candidate. But he refused to rule out a scenario where his caucus would help elect the next speaker if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear if Hakeem Jeffries would be willing to help Kevin McCarthy 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\n“Democrats are in the process of organizing the Democratic Conference,” Jeffries told CNN on Thursday. “Republicans are in the process of organizing the Republican Conference. Let’s see what happens on January 3.”\n\nSome of the potential consensus picks that have been floated included retiring Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and John Katko of New York, who both voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection; Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus; and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a veteran lawmaker and incoming head of the House Rules Committee.\n\nBut that would require agreement from every single Democrat and the help of five Republicans – no easy feat. Upton said he has no plans to be in Washington that day, telling CNN: “I’ll be skiing.”\n\nAnd progressives like Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York said they would never vote for a GOP speaker candidate, no matter how moderate.\n\n“No,” Bowman said, indicating he’d be voting for Jeffries on every ballot on January 3. “It’s going to be Hakeem.”\n\nBut Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said this has happened before – nearly a decade ago in his state where minority Democrats in the Arkansas legislature joined forces with a handful of Republicans to elect a GOP speaker of their choice. Westerman privately made this case to his colleagues at a closed-door meeting this week.\n\n“I’m concerned about January 3 getting here and us not being able to form a Congress and organize committees and getting delayed in pushing the policy objectives that we want to push,” Westerman said.\n\nWesterman added that the discussion over changing House rules is good for the party.

Democrats, in no hurry to resolve the GOP stalemate, tried to block the effort but failed.\n\nA voice vote was too close in a House currently without rules, and Democrats shouted for the clerk to hold a recorded vote. Members filed up to the rostrum to cast their votes, as others stood behind them and anxiously looked up at the House scoreboard.\n\nThe GOP, which ultimately has a four-vote majority in the House, won the debate 216-214, with at least two Republicans siding with Democrats.\n\nAfter six votes in two days, Wednesday night ended without a speaker in the House. A seventh vote likely blocking McCarthy, who is more than a dozen votes shy fo what he needs, would have ensued if the House had not adjourned. It's been 100 years since a speaker's election took more than one ballot.\n\nThe House reconvenes at noon Thursday, when McCarthy will resume his prolonged fight for speaker.\n\nThe situation, which has dragged on since Tuesday, has left Congress paralyzed, since no member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in and no rules can be adopted until a speaker is chosen.\n\nThe House remained stuck after McCarthy was nominated, several times, for the top job in that chamber. He appears to have failed again to have secured that job - for now.\n\nOn Tuesday, McCarthy was denied the 218 votes he needed by a cadre of Republican hardliners in three separate ballots.

Months\n\nNot since 1923 has a speaker’s election gone to multiple ballots.\n\nThe longest and most grueling fight for the gavel started in late 1855 and dragged out for two months, with 133 ballots, during debates over slavery in the run-up to the Civil War.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nTrump power? Ex-president hasn't moved the needle on McCarthy – and many Republicans noticed\n\nSo far, not a single Republican opponent of Kevin McCarthy has changed his or her vote after former President Donald Trump urged them to back McCarthy and move on.\n\n\"Currently on full display: how DEEPLY weakened Trump is,\" tweeted Alyssa Farah Griffin, an aide in the Trump White House. \"Even his staunchest allies aren’t afraid to defy him & his endorsement did nothing to get McCarthy more votes.\"\n\nMany Republicans pointed out the comments of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who said her \"favorite president\" asked her and other members of the anti-McCarthy faction to \"knock this off,\" but he should instead call McCarthy and tell him \"'you do not have the votes, and it's time to withdraw.'\"\n\nAfter that comment, Republican strategist Scott Jennings said: \"Not only are they disregarding Trump but they are now ORDERING HIM AROUND. Unbelievable!\"\n\nTrump has faced rising criticism since the November elections; many Republicans blamed the ex-president for the party's disappointing showing, not to mention the many investigations swirling around him.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPreviously:Republican support for Trump's 2024 bid falls amid political, legal setbacks\n\nGOP: Lack of speaker means lack of security clearances\n\nA group of GOP members-elect said without a speaker, they lack access to secure facilities where they receive daily briefs related to the nation's security.\n\nFollowing McCarthy's sixth failed attempt at speaker, Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher said during a press conference that he was supposed to meet with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to talk about matters in the Indo-Pacific, but was informed by House security that he does not have a clearance.\n\n“My point is we have work to do that we can’t do right now,” Gallagher, who is a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, said.\n\nMichigan Rep.

McCarthy also fell short in three votes on Tuesday; he needs 218 to prevail, and it's unclear how he can get there.\n\nA group of 20 conservatives again voted for Byron Donalds on the sixth ballot, as they did on ballots four and five.\n\nA former McCarthy supporter, Victoria Spartz, voted \"present.\"\n\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries remained the top vote getter, with the support of 212 Democratic colleagues.\n\nThe House then adjourned until 8 p.m.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDay two of Congress:As Santos fiddles with his phone, investigators circle, speaker votes are cast\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose sixth House speaker vote\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy lost a sixth vote in his bid for speaker, putting an exclamation point on two long days that have not gone in his favor.\n\nRep. Kat Cammack of Florida described his sixth nomination as “Groundhog Day” and urged fellow Republicans to unite and get things done for the American people.\n\nBut an opposition group within his own party, largely led by conservative Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene called her party’s inability to pick a speaker “embarrassing.”\n\n“I hope it’s over soon because, to be honest with you, I find it embarrassing,” Greene told reporters on her way back to the House floor.\n\nGreene also gave credit to Democrats for being able to work together, saying that she thinks the GOP “should find ways to work together.”\n\n- Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nCammack says it’s “Groundhog Day” as she nominates McCarthy\n\nGOP Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida called it “Groundhog Day” as she nominated House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker – his sixth nomination in two days.\n\nShe said the American people don’t care about who’s going to be speaker; they care about getting results to problems, such as the ongoing opioid crisis and “open border.”\n\n“They didn’t send us to be perpetual critics,” Cammack said. “They sent us to get things done.”\n\nIt’s time to unite and do the people’s business, she said.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nQuest for the gavel:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nNo change for McCarthy on the fifth ballot\n\nThe fifth ballot went the same as the fourth, according to the official House tally: McCarthy again won 201 votes, well short of the 218 he needs to become speaker.\n\nAgain, 20 Republicans voted for a non-McCarthy alternative, Byron Donalds.\n\nAgain, former McCarthy supporter Victoria Spartz voted \"present.\"\n\nAnd, again, Hakeem Jeffries racked up 212 votes from fellow Democrats.\n\nOn toward a sixth ballot.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCould Jeffries win the speakership?\n\nJeffries has consistently received 212 votes in each of the ballots—gaining the support of every Democrat in the House and surpassing the number of ballots for McCarthy. But it is highly unlikely that Jeffries would win the speakership.\n\nIt would require a member, or multiple members, of the Republican party to reach across the aisle and cast a ballot in support of the opposite party.\n\nThe last time a lawmaker voted for the opposite political party was in 2001. Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio voted for the Republican speaker nominee. The Democratic party stripped him of all committee assignments in response.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWho is Hakeem Jeffries?:What to know about the Brooklyn Rep. nominated for Congress\n\nDonalds: ‘I never came here to try to be speaker’\n\nFlorida Rep. Byron Donalds, who received 20 votes in the last ballot, said he expects the speaker to be elected today, but added that serving in the top leadership position was never his intention. He said he anticipates meeting with McCarthy later today.\n\n“I didn’t come to DC being interested in becoming speaker of the House,” he said, adding, however, that he understands the responsibility of making sure the Republican conference can govern. “I’m going to help do that in any way I can,” he said.\n\n“The time of leadership by acclamation, those days are over,” he said.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose fifth vote\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy appears to have lost his bid for speaker a fifth consecutive time, continuing a string of stinging defeats and a tumultuous day in the lower chamber.\n\nMcCarthy lost three times Tuesday and twice so far Wednesday. There could be more votes this afternoon, as no member in either party has motioned to adjourn.\n\nBefore the fifth vote, multiple McCarthy allies worked to end the impasse with his 20 detractors, but the count proved out of their favor.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nWho is McCarthy?:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nWho voted present today on the fourth ballot?\n\nOn the fourth ballot for speaker, Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz opted to vote “present” after backing McCarthy in the previous three ballots, in another blow to McCarthy’s chances of securing the speakership.\n\n“We have a constitutional duty to elect the speaker of the House, but we have to deliberate further as a Republican conference until we have enough votes and stop wasting everyone’s time.” Spartz said. “None of the Republican candidates have this number yet. That’s why I voted present after all votes were cast.”\n\nNo member from McCarthy’s opposition has yet to flip and vote for McCarthy as speaker.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nA new Congress with new priorities:What to know on investigations, the fate of Biden's agenda and more\n\nTrump has been calling GOP lawmakers to urge support for McCarthy, Boebert says\n\nGOP Rep. Lauren Boebert in her nominating remarks shook off Trump’s endorsement of McCarthy.\n\n“Let’s stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us,” said Boebert. “Even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off, I think it actually needs to be reversed.”\n\n“The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy, ‘Sir you do not have the votes and it’s time to withdraw.’” said Boebert to cheers from McCarthy’s opposition.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nThrowback:Lawmakers sound off on recorded call of Kevin McCarthy saying Trump should resign over Jan. 6\n\nBoebert nominates Donalds\n\nRep.

Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican who took former Speaker John Boehner’s seat, nominated Rep. Kevin McCarthy Wednesday immediately following the House GOP leader’s fourth loss for speaker.\n\nDavidson pointed out that there may be some members who don’t trust McCarthy, but said there are about 200 members who don’t trust the leader’s 20 detractors.\n\nAfter rattling off a list of concessions he said McCarthy has made to those voting against him, Davidson said, “Kevin McCarthy engaged in that negotiation. He led the Congress to adopt substantive reforms that will make our majority more effective.”\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nRound four: Another loss for McCarthy\n\nThe fourth ballot, the first of Wednesday, went a little worse for McCarthy.\n\nThe struggling speaker candidate officially wound up with only 201 votes, fewer than the numbers he took on the three ballots on Tuesday, according to the House clerk. One of his previous supporters, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, voted \"present\" on Wednesday.\n\nMcCarthy needs 218 votes to win the speaker's job, and he is moving a little farther away.\n\nThis despite a morning endorsement from Donald Trump and heavy lobbying from allies who say all this is making the Republicans look bad.\n\nDespite the pressure, McCarthy opponents who supported Jim Jordan for speaker on Monday backed a new challenger on Tuesday, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. He received 20 votes, the same number Jordan got on Tuesday's third ballot.\n\nThe stalemate again allowed Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries to become the top vote getter with 212 Democrats, but without the majority needed to prevail.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat's happening in the House:Who are the Republicans balking at Kevin McCarthy as a House speaker?\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose fourth ballot\n\nThe outlook for Kevin McCarthy grew dimmer Wednesday afternoon when the House GOP leader appeared to have lost his bid for speaker a fourth consecutive time.\n\nIt was a crucial vote for McCarthy, who after losing three times yesterday worked to find a path forward today. He and his allies have tried to both sway his opponents and also persuade some of them to vote “present,” making it easier for him to win with a lower voting majority.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was evident McCarthy did little to advance when he did not pick up any votes.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nGallagher nominates McCarthy for speaker\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher. a Wisconsin Republican, nominated House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker – his fourth nomination in two days.\n\n“I wish we had a bigger majority,” Gallagher said, “but the American people gave us an opportunity.”\n\nMcCarthy is not asking for a vote to keep business as usual, Gallagher said. The leader wants to do the people’s business, he said.\n\nGaetz challenges McCarthy over office space\n\nIt's really gotten personal between aspiring House Speaker McCarthy and conservative critic Matt Gaetz.\n\nGaetz has asked the Architect of the Capitol to investigate McCarthy for moving stuff into the Speaker of the House's suite of offices, even though he failed to actually win the job during three ballots on Tuesday.\n\n\"How long will he remain there before he is considered a squatter?\" the Florida Republican said in a letter to the architect's office.\n\nAnother McCarthy opponent, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, re-tweeted Gaetz's complaint and amplified the itinerant metaphor: \"McCarthy is squatting in the Speaker’s office.\"\n\nFor his part, McCarthy and his allies have criticized Gaetz for saying he would rather see Democrat Hakeem Jeffries win the speaker's job than McCarthy.\n\nStay tuned for more news about McCarthy's political future – and his office.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence chimes in, urges House GOP to elect McCarthy as speaker\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence offered his perspective on McCarthy’s battle, urging House Republicans “to support my friend, Kevin McCarthy as the next speaker of the House.”\n\n“@GOPLeader’s (McCarthy's) leadership & vision led to the new Republican majority & I know Speaker McCarthy will lead the House to begin a great American comeback!” Pence tweeted.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nAguilar: ‘Crisis of the Congress’\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California, the House Democratic Caucus chair, reiterated support for Jeffries Wednesday morning and said he will be nominating Jeffries during the speaker votes this afternoon. All 212 Democrats voted for Jeffries Tuesday during the three ballots.\n\n“This is a crisis of the congress,” Aguilar said of yesterday’s proceedings.\n\nHe added that Democrats have not had any outreach with their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Ted Lieu said the speakership position has already weakened from the inability of the Republican caucus to unite and select a speaker, noting that Democrats are also at a standstill and can’t appoint members to committees.\n\n“They’ve already weakened that position,” Lieu said of the speakership, referencing McCarthy’s concessions including the motion to vacate.\n\n- Rachel Looker and Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\n'The rest of the world is looking': Biden calls GOP House speaker fight ‘embarrassing’\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Republicans’ fight over electing a new House speaker “embarrassing,” “not a good look” and “not my problem” as he sought to contrast the chaos in House with a focus on governing.\n\n“I hope they get their act together,” Biden told reporters Wednesday, adding that “the rest of the world is looking” and he is focused on “getting things done.”\n\nBiden, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, was en route to Kentucky. There he will appear with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other officeholders of both parties to promote bipartanship by showcasing a major bridge project funded by federal infrastructure dollars.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nGaetz: Trump won't change my mind about opposing McCarthy\n\nMatt Gaetz, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump, is saying Trump's endorsement of McCarthy won't shake his opposition to the latter's candidacy for House speaker.\n\n\"Sad!\" Gaetz said in a Wednesday statement to Fox News Digital. \"This changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post hours earlier, Trump hit the all-caps button to say to Republican dissidents: \"VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY.\"\n\nGaetz is especially close to Trump; he once endorsed Trump himself for the speaker's job. If Trump can't change his mind, it's hard to see many of the 20 or so opponents of McCarthy changing theirs.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat about George Santos?\n\nAs if the GOP didn't have enough distractions.\n\nRep.-elect George Santos, of New York, has been embroiled in controversy after reports found he made up multiple parts of his biography during the 2022 midterm campaign.\n\nThe 34-year-old Republican, who is under investigation by New York prosecutors, admitted he lied about his educational achievements, his ancestry and his employment. He was in the chamber Tuesday for the speaker vote and is expected to be there Wednesday.\n\nOn the first three ballots, Santos voted for McCarthy. Like all other members of the House, he can take part in the vote for speaker though he won't be sworn in until after one is chosen.\n\nTrump calls for members to vote for McCarthy\n\nIn a new Truth Social post Wednesday morning, Former President Donald Trump called on Republican House members to support Kevin McCarthy.\n\n“Vote for Kevin, close the deal, take the victory,” Trump said in all caps.\n\nHe urged Republicans: “Do not turn a great triumph into a giant & embarrassing defeat.”\n\nTrump said it’s time to celebrate, seemingly referring to the GOP’s four-vote majority in the House.\n\n“Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a great job – just watch!” he said in closing.\n\nMcCarthy’s most fervent opponents are some of Trump’s biggest supporters. It remains to be seen if they will be swayed by his endorsement Wednesday morning.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat to expect today\n\nThe House formally gavels in at noon, but both Republicans and Democrats will be meeting throughout the morning.\n\nOn the Republican side, Rep. Kevin McCarthy and his allies are working on two fronts: they are trying to negotiate with his detractors to sway their votes to his side and they’re also trying to get some members to vote “present” rather than for a named candidate. Voting present would ultimately help McCarthy boost his numbers and lower the threshold for which he needs to become speaker.\n\nOn the Democratic side, House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu will hold a press conference at 10:45 a.m. after their closed caucus meeting that starts at 9 a.m. Look for Democrats to take questions on whether they will help Republicans by having some members absent from the chamber today, lowering the overall voting majority and number McCarthy would need to clinch the speakership.\n\nLast night, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus is focused on having a working partnership with Republicans to pass bipartisan legislation, but they’re not responsible for helping the GOP get organized.\n\nOnce the House gavels in at noon, members-elect could choose to vote again for speaker or adjourn again to allow for more negotiations.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat changed overnight?\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy is shifting his strategy to become speaker of the House – or at least he’s shifting the way he’s talking about it.\n\nWhen a confident, almost defiant, McCarthy spoke during and after a Republican conference meeting Tuesday morning, he had said he wasn’t making any more concessions to appease the most conservative flank of his party and that he had “earned” the speakership.\n\nBy Tuesday night at the Capitol, after he had lost three votes to become speaker, he said he wanted all views to be represented on House committees and that negotiations were ongoing between his more than 200 supporters and 20 detractors.\n\nMcCarthy also said he had a new path to the speakership. Rather than focusing on the 218 votes needed to win the speakership outright, he mentioned 11 votes last night he needs to flip. A lot of that strategy involves getting some of his 20 dissenters to vote “present” rather than for a named candidate, which would allow him to win the speakership with a lower majority of votes.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nMembers will continue to vote — again and again potentially when they come back at noon. The vote could last for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes. This leaves the House paralyzed since no member can be sworn in, no rules can be adopted and no legislative business can be conducted until a speaker is chosen\n\nMcCarthy could drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the speakership. As of Tuesday afternoon, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining enough votes to win the speakership. During the three ballots, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin and New York Rep. Byron Donalds received votes.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers could adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nMore:McCarthy denied, Santos in House: 5 takeaways from the tumultuous first day of a new Congress\n\nMore:What can Congress do about Rep.-elect George Santos, who lied ahead of winning his election?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/03/kevin-mccarthy-speaker-live-updates/71044062007/", "title": "Kevin McCarthy ousted as speaker in historic house vote: Recap", "text": "WASHINGTON — Republican Kevin McCarthy’s deal with hardline House conservatives that handed him the speaker’s gavel in January unraveled on Tuesday as those same right-wing rebels, joined by Democrats, shoved him out of the seat.\n\nMcCarthy’s 269-day reign as speaker was ended by a 216-210 vote, a move that has no marker in modern history and paralyzes Congress for the time being.\n\nThe rebellion, led by conservative hardliner Rep.

It's been a long long time,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy says he had respect for the president despite their different philosophies, but wished the president was more \"hands on.\"\n\nThe timeline raised some eyebrows in Washington, considering Congress last week voted to temporarily avert a government shutdown that would have impacted millions of Americans. But House Republicans have also launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden, claiming he benefitted from his family's business dealings.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nPelosi, McCarthy says, vowed to back him up\n\nDuring his pursuit of the speakership that lasted 15 votes earlier this year, one of McCarthy's key concessions was allowing a single member of Congress to file a motion to vacate.\n\nMcCarthy counseled his fellow Californian and former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for advice.

Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told reporters McCarthy plans to not run again.\n\nThe plan, the Oklahoma Republican said, is to adjourn for the night and discuss alternatives to succeed McCarthy\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz walks into GOP closed door meeting\n\nGaetz has entered a closed-door House GOP conference meeting to discuss next steps after he ousted McCarthy as speaker.\n\nHe did not answer any questions on his way in.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhite House pushes House to ‘quickly elect’ McCarthy’s replacement\n\nPresident Joe Biden wants the Republican-led House of Representatives to move quickly to elect a new speaker to replace McCarthy following his removal, the White House said.\n\n“Because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will quickly elect a Speaker,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of Biden. “The American people deserve leadership that puts the issues affecting their lives front and center.”\n\nPrior to the vote to vacate McCarthy’s speakership, the White House did not take a public position whether McCarthy should remain in his role and instead deferred to House Democratic leaders who voted to oust McCarthy.\n\nThe White House highlighted a “split screen” Tuesday between the chaos in the House and action in the executive branch as Biden announced that all 10 prescription drug drugs tapped for Medicare’s first price negotiations have agreed to participate.\n\n“Once the House has met their responsibility to elect a speaker,” Jean-Pierre said, \"he looks forward to working together with them and with the Senate to address the American peoples’ priorities.”\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nGaetz, McCarthy's chief antagonist, claims victory\n\nGaetz, who spearheaded the successful efforts to oust McCarthy from his post, claimed victory on the Capitol steps after the historic vote to remove the speaker.\n\n\"It's the benefit of this country that we have a better speaker of the House than Kevin McCarthy,\" Gaetz told reporters after the vote. \"We should elect a speaker who's better.\"\n\nThe Florida conservative taunted his moderate colleagues as House Republicans are expected to huddle to discuss next steps.\n\n\"The stages of grief I think are in progress right now with some of my colleagues. I think there was a stage of denial. I've certainly experienced a good amount of their anger. And now we appear to be headed towards bargaining,\" Gaetz said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGOP Rep. Ryan Zinke: ‘This is a vote without purpose’\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., told reporters that he thinks McCarthy being ousted as speaker is “sad and tragic.”\n\nZinke said he doesn’t think McCarthy gives up when asked whether the next election in the House for speaker will spark multiple rounds of contentious voting.\n\n“Last week, one of the latest excuses - not valid - is that McCarthy reached out to members that voted with purpose on the continuing resolution,\" he said, referencing the temporary measure that lawmakers approved to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n\"In the last round, the Democrats did vote with purpose. They voted to keep the government open and they voted to keep the policies in place,\" he said, before calling the vote to remove McCarthy \"a vote without purpose. And I always look at purpose and intent.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP lawmaker to lose Republican support over McCarthy vote\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy, said he’s already received angry phone calls, less than an hour since the vote ended.\n\n“This will cost me,” Burchett said. “I’ve already gotten the calls from a lot of the big supporters of mine that said they’ll never support me again.”\n\nBurchett said that made it a “tough decision,” but “I worry more about our country.”\n\nWhen asked who would be picked to replace McCarthy, the Tennessee congressman said he’s been in conversations but didn’t have a name to share. He said there could be about eight lawmakers in the running.\n\n“Members have whispered in my ear,” Burchett said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican lawmaker: ‘Much different than the speaker’s election’\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters that the vote to oust McCarthy was “much different than the speaker's election where one wins, one loses,” despite the group of Republicans seeking to remove him from the leadership office.\n\n“It’s certainly a disappointment, and I think those responsible for coordinating reflect on it and I think if they do…I don't think they'll ever think they made the right call, but that's up to them,” Cole said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho will be the next speaker of the House? Patrick McHenry?\n\nRepublican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina is temporarily leading the House after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. McHenry, one of McCarthy's closest allies, is known as the speaker pro tempore.\n\nThe speaker pro tempore has far more limited powers compared to a speaker of the House, but he will preside over the lower chamber until a new speaker is elected.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho voted against Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a historic turn of events, McCarthy has been ousted as speaker, leaving the House in turmoil as lawmakers must elect a new permanent speaker.\n\nEight GOP lawmakers voted to eject McCarthy from the speakership, they are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKevin McCarthy is ousted, House moves to elect new speaker\n\nConservative rebels successfully ousted McCarthy as speaker, plunging the House into chaos as lawmakers move to elect a new speaker. House Democrats, who voted against the motion to table, joined the conservative hardliners in ejecting McCarthy from the speakership. The vote to oust McCarthy was 216-210.\n\nMcCarthy, even though he was ousted, is still able to run again as speaker if nominated by a lawmaker. In the meantime, an acting interim speaker must be named, but they will have limited power.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIn sign of hope for McCarthy, one GOP vote flips in his favor\n\nIn a glimmer of hope for McCarthy’s speakership, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio., who voted against the motion to delay Gaetz’ effort to oust him, also voted against the motion to vacate.\n\nDavidson’s vote is a sign there could be more conservative hardliners who flip in favor of McCarthy.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse starts roll call vote to decide Kevin McCarthy's fate\n\nAs the House starts voting on whether or not to eject McCarthy from the speakership, a sense of deja vu has fallen on the House floor, as lawmakers are voting through voice vote, similar to how lawmakers voted during the speaker election back in January.\n\nIt will take a while. Each lawmaker has to be called one-by-one to declare their vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz calls Biden impeachment inquiry ‘failure theater’\n\nGaetz, making his case to oust McCarthy, slammed Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden as “failure theater.”\n\nIn the first impeachment inquiry hearing targeting Biden last week, three expert witnesses invited by Republicans each told the House Oversight Committee no evidence has emerged that Biden committed an impeachable offense. It was a setback in Republican efforts to impeach Biden.\n\n“It’s hard to make the argument that oversight is the reason to continue when it looks like failure theater,” said Gaetz, responding to comments earlier by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who defended McCarthy.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nGOP yells ‘Shame!’ at Gaetz for fundraising off motion to vacate\n\nOne of Kevin McCarthy’s top lieutenants, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., defended the speaker in an impassioned speech, also lambasting Matt Gaetz for fundraising off of his efforts to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\n“Using official actions to raise money, it’s disgusting,” Graves said.\n\nWhen Graves held up his phone displaying one of Gaetz’ fundraising messages, GOP lawmakers yelled “Shame!” at Gaetz.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGaetz met with silence as he debates McCarthy allies\n\nIn a display of just how much power a handful of conservative hardliners wield over the the House, Matt Gaetz has responded to nearly every Kevin McCarthy ally speaking on the California Republicans’ behalf on the House floor.\n\nThe contrast between the two factions couldn’t be any more clear.\n\nWhile McCarthy allies including Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. has received overwhelming applause from GOP lawmakers after their remarks, Gaetz’ speeches have been met with silence.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if McCarthy is ousted?\n\nIf the House votes to oust McCarthy, then someone would have to fill his position temporarily until an election is set and the next speaker is chosen in the lower chamber.\n\nThat temporary replacement would be chosen from a succession list McCarthy submitted in January. According to Rule one, clause 8 of House rules, the next person on the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.”\n\n“Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end,” the House rules say.\n\nThe rules don’t specify how long the person would temporarily fill the speaker’s spot. It is unclear when the House would choose to hold an election for the next speaker if McCarthy is removed.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMcCarthy nearly expressionless as House Republicans debate his fate\n\nWhile House Republicans debate on McCarthy’s fate as speaker, the California Republican, sitting in the second row from the front of the floor, has been nearly expressionless, only occasionally chatting with Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., who is seated next to him.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIs GOP hostage to right-flank of party?\n\nThe 11 Republican lawmakers who joined Democrats to vote against a procedural vote delaying the motion to vacate now leads to a final vote on the House floor to oust McCarthy.\n\nThese 11 Republicans include some of the most ultra-conservative members of the Republican conference, including members of the House Freedom Caucus like Reps. Bob Good of Virginia, Ken Buck of Colorado, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Rosendale of Montana and Eli Crane of Arizona.\n\nDespite comprising a minority of the Republican caucus, these ultra-conservative members, with help from the other side of the aisle, may be the reason McCarthy is removed from his speakership.\n\nSome, like Good, listed their grievances with McCarthy as speaker. Good called it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything, besides just staying or becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDemocrats stand aside as House Republicans debate among themselves\n\nWhile Kevin McCarthy's allies and the conservative hardliners against the speaker debate on the House floor over his speakership, Democrats have stayed on the sidelines watching House Republicans quarrel amongst themselves.\n\nAs the rest of the House GOP conference cheered on McCarthy's allies and jeered at Gaetz, House Democrats remained silent, reflecting Jeffries and leadership's intention for House Republicans to settle the matter within their own conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nRepublican calls McCarthy ouster 'totally avoidable situation'\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va., who voted against tabling the motion to vacate against McCarthy, spoke on the House floor after the vote listing his grievances with McCarthy and calling it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\nGood said back in January during the votes that made McCarthy speaker, he persuaded five of his colleagues to vote present in the final vote that allowed McCarthy to win his leadership role. He claimed he continued to work with McCarthy and persuade some of his ultra-conservative colleagues to support McCarthy’s priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe Virginia lawmaker claimed McCarthy made a promise to bring 12 spending bills to the floor individually this year, which did not happen as Congress lurched toward a government shutdown this weekend. Good said he reluctantly agreed to vote for a short-term solution to avert a shutdown, despite the promise McCarthy made\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything besides just staying and becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy ally: ‘This is a very sad day’\n\nSpeaking on behalf of McCarthy and his allies on the House floor, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., chair of the House Rules Committee, praised the California Republicans’ leadership through multiple tough votes that put McCarthy’s speakership into question, including negotiations over the debt ceiling earlier this year and the recent government shutdown crisis.\n\n“We were on the verge of a government shutdown,” Cole said. “He put his political neck on the line … to do the right thing.”\n\n“He did the right thing for our party,” Cole added, earning a standing ovation from the majority of the House GOP conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho will serve as speaker if Kevin McCarthy is ousted?\n\nThat's not clear.\n\nIf McCarthy is removed from his leadership role a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nBut who's likely on that list? Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority leader, is a likely option. So is Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the majority whip, another crucial leadership position.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTexas Republican concerned about upcoming vote to remove McCarthy\n\nThere is not a clear name for McCarthy’s successor, should the speaker be ousted, said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-TX.\n\n“There’s not really an option. Another reason this is very silly,” he said.\n\nThe Texas congressman said he’s worried about the message today’s events will send to voters about the GOP.\n\n“It’s clear that there’s just a group of people that don’t want conservatives to win,” Crenshaw said. “And they label themselves as the most conservative, which is not possibly true.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nPresident Joe Biden stays out of Kevin McCarthy speakership fight\n\nThe White House is staying out of the fight over McCarthy’s speakership – seemingly more than happy to watch Republicans beat up each other.\n\n“We’re just not going to get involved,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday, deferring to House Democratic leaders who have vowed they won’t help McCarthy.\n\nJean-Pierre said it is “nothing new” for the White House not to weigh in on congressional leadership decisions.\n\n“Is there chaos in the House Republicans? Absolutely. That is something that they have to deal with,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden said, “I don't have a vote on that matter. I'll leave that to the leadership of the House and the Senate.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n'Get a time machine'\n\nWhen asked whether there was anything McCarthy could do to change anything, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told reporters that he could “get a time machine and bring us all back to the table like I suggested two months ago and keep his word.”\n\nBurchett added that “everything’s always chaos..this country was built on chaos” and said he was more concerned about the dollar collapsing and the economy failing.\n\n“It scares me a lot worse,” Burchett said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n11 GOP lawmakers vote against McCarthy in setback to his speakership\n\n11 GOP lawmakers voted against the motion to table the effort to oust McCarthy in a massive setback for the speaker. The House will on the motion to vacate McCarthy, which is the formal vote that will decide his speakership.\n\nThe members that voted against McCarthy are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Cory Mills, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMotion to table fails: McCarthy’s speakership closer to the brink\n\nKevin McCarthy faced a severe setback when a handful of conservative hardliners and House Democrats voted against a procedural motion – known as a motion to table – to discard Gaetz’ efforts to oust the California Republican as speaker. The vote failed by 208-218\n\nThe House will immediately vote now on the motion to vacate to determine whether McCarthy stays in his post.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House vows US support for Ukraine won’t waver if McCarthy loses job\n\nThe White House expressed confidence Tuesday that Congress will continue to support aid for Ukraine if House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is ousted from his speakership.\n\n“Regardless of what happens in the House of Representatives,” said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security issues, “all the House leadership is supportive of continuing to help Ukraine and the vast majority of House members on the Republican side are in support.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden is pushing Congress to approve additional aid to help Ukraine fight Russia after Congress passed a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown for several weeks that lacked Ukraine funding to appease hardline Republicans. A growing number of far-right Republicans in the House oppose continued support of Ukraine.\n\nMcCarthy, whose speakership is in jeopardy, has backed Ukraine funding in the past but said he wants future financial support for Ukraine to be tied to additional security on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We don't believe they should be tied, or one dependent on the other, but both are important,” Kirby said.\n\nBiden held a phone call with NATO allies Tuesday in which he “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes as it,” the White House said.\n\n“As winter fast approaches, it is imperative that we help them take advantage of every single day,” Kirby said. “A lapse of support for even a short period of time can make all the difference on the battlefield.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump: Why are Republicans 'always fighting among themselves'?\n\nWhile attending his bank fraud trial in New York for a second day, Donald Trump found time Tuesday to weigh in on the drama surrounding McCarthy - sort of.\n\nTrump did not mention McCarthy or Gaetz by name in a Truth Social post, nor has he taken a public position on their dispute, but he did criticize GOP in-fighting.\n\nSaid the former president: \"Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren’t they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNancy Pelosi says Democrats aren't taking up speaker fight\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, shared in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"In this Congress, it is the responsibility of House Republicans to choose a nominee & elect the Speaker on the Floor.\"\n\n\"At this time there is no justification for a departure from this tradition,\" she added.\n\nHer comments come as House Democrats have vowed not to step in and save Kevin McCarthy from a rebellion from his fellow Republicans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitics:Will Kevin McCarthy be forced out as Speaker of the House? Here's how it could happen.\n\nAbsences could save McCarthy\n\nAhead of the procedural vote to suspend Gaetz’ motion to vacate against McCarthy, the California Republican could be saved due to absences.\n\nThe procedural vote – referred to as a motion to table – requires just a simple majority rather than an absolute majority. That means McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to table the motion to vacate, but rather just more votes to table the motion than against it.\n\nBoth House Republicans and House Democrats are seeing absences that could factor into McCarthy’s survival.\n\nIt is unclear how many absences there are on each side, but House Democrats are currently voting by hand in an unrelated vote series likely to buy more time for their rank and file members to make it to the crucial vote on McCarthy’s fate.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n‘We’ll see what happens’: Lawmakers enter House chamber for votes\n\nAs lawmakers file into the House chamber, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., took a swipe at Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., when asked about the upcoming vote against McCarthy. Greene has long supported the speaker.\n\n“Are we all gonna be dressing like John Fetterman here pretty soon when we don’t have a speaker and don’t have rules,” Greene said. “We’ll see what happens.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho's trying to oust Kevin McCarthy? Matt Gaetz, Freedom Caucus members\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced a motion Monday night to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the top position in the House.\n\nHis motion came after a contentious week of negotiations to avoid a government shutdown, during which Gaetz had previously threatened to oust McCarthy if the Speaker looked across the aisle for support.\n\nBut Gaetz is joined in the push by several members tied to the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, including Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nWhat happens if there's a government shutdown and no speaker of the House?\n\nIf McCarthy is ousted by his fellow Republicans, and Democrats refuse to step in and help him, a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nThat means the House could continue with its important business, as lawmakers have just weeks to compromise on a slate of spending bills to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens if Congress ousts McCarthy?\n\nIf the House decides to remove McCarthy as speaker, then someone from a private backup list provided by McCarthy at the beginning of the year will fill his slot until a new election is held.\n\n“There's a little disagreement amongst Hill procedural experts about how much power that temporary Speaker would actually wield,” Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Washington Post.\n\nHowever, McCarthy can choose to run as speaker again. It is unclear when the House would hold that vote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMotion to vacate history: Has a speaker of the House ever been removed?\n\nThe last time the House voted on a motion to vacate was 1910 against then-Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-Ill. In 2015, then-Rep. Mark Meadows filed a motion against Speaker John Boehner, but it never made it to a floor vote.\n\nA House speaker has never been removed via a motion to vacate. Boehner resigned months after Meadows' motion amid continued dissent in his party.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nCapitol Hill in turmoil\n\nThe move to oust Kevin McCarthy has consumed the House in turmoil as lawmakers strategize over how to approach the conservative rebellion against the California Republican.\n\nMcCarthy, exiting a closed-door weekly conference meeting, told reporters firmly he wouldn't entertain working with Democrats to save his speakership and conceded that \"I'm out\" if a handful of Republicans decide to boot him from the speakership.\n\nIn their own extended closed-door conference meeting to discuss strategy, to prevent leaks, House Democratic lawmakers were barred from bringing in their phones to the meeting as leadership decided on whether or not to bail McCarthy out.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats will vote to remove Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a lengthy letter sent to House Democrats, Jeffries said leadership will vote to vacate McCarthy from the speakership.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" the letter reads.\n\nHouse Democrats have for days said they will vote in line with their leadership. Jeffries' statement means that McCarthy's speakership will hinge on uniting enough House Republicans behind him to defeat the conservative rebellion.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat state does Kevin McCarthy represent? How long has Kevin McCarthy been in Congress?\n\nKevin McCarthy was sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives in 2007. He represents California's 20th House District, which includes parts of Kern, Fresno, Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nCongress voted to make McCarthy speaker of the House in January, after a marathon 15 rounds of votes. He faced objections from some of the same hard-right lawmakers in January during his bid to become speaker that he faces now as they seek to remove him.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs McCarthy being impeached?\n\nNo, Kevin McCarthy is facing what's known as a motion to vacate, which could remove him from his role as speaker of the House, a role that's in line behind the vice president to succeed the presidency, if needed.\n\nImpeachment is a process designed to remove presidents from office, along with other federal officials. House Republicans have opened up an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, but they haven't approved any formal articles of impeachment against him.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is a motion to vacate?\n\nA motion to vacate is a congressional procedure initiated by a House member that calls for the removal of a sitting House speaker and the election of a new one, according to Ballotpedia.\n\nWhile the motion can be brought forth by one person, there must be a majority vote in the House to remove the top leader.\n\nUnder House rules, the motion must be voted on in two legislative days.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Democrats help McCarthy?\n\nThe answer is likely no.\n\nAs of noon on Tuesday, it appears Democrats will remain unified and vote to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker of the House.\n\n“House Democrats are going to continue to push people over politics,” House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“We are ready to find bipartisan common ground,” he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our extreme colleagues have shown no willingness to do the same. They must find a way to end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\nOther lawmakers made clear they support House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. call to “end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\n“I hope everybody votes no on the motion to table. I expect everybody to be unified,” Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Tuesday after leaving a Democratic caucus meeting.\n\nThe New Democrat Coalition also stands unified behind Jeffries.\n\n“New Dems are proud to stand with our leader and our caucus to deliver progress for the American people,” Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., chair of the coalition, said in a statement.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Ken Tran\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nAmong one of the key concessions McCarthy made to conservative hardliners in his bid for the speakership in January was allowing a single lawmaker to initiate a motion to vacate.\n\nPrevious speakers set parameters on how lawmakers could try to oust these leaders, from only allowing party leadership to attempt to eject the speaker or requiring multiple lawmakers to agree on a motion to vacate.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has repeatedly flirted with ousting McCarthy since Republicans took control of the House but the Florida Republican finally followed up on his threats after McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert a government shutdown over the weekend.\n\n“I believe the basis for the motion to vacate is Kevin McCarthy’s repeated breach of the agreement that he made in January,” Gaetz told reporters Monday after formally filing the motion to oust McCarthy, alleging the speaker broke an agreement – that was never released on paper – he made with hardline conservatives in January.\n\n– Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/10/house-speaker-republicans-kevin-mccarthy/71120210007/", "title": "Who will be the new speaker of the House? Republicans race to vote", "text": "WASHINGTON – Despite the House being frozen without a speaker, Congress is in for a hectic week as Republicans scramble to find a new leader after the historic ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nHouse Republicans have a schedule: They'll meet Tuesday night to hold a candidate forum where prospective speakers will make their pitches to fellow GOP lawmakers. Next, they'll hold a secret vote on a nominee Wednesday night.\n\nIt's unclear when the House will hold an official speaker election. But the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militants could pressure lawmakers to pick up the pace and elect a new speaker so the House can act on the war, especially if they need to approve humanitarian aid or other crucial measures.\n\nHere’s what to know going into a chaotic week in Congress:\n\nHouse Republicans are set to hold closed-door meetings ahead of speaker vote. Will they rally around a leader?\n\nFollowing McCarthy’s historic ouster as speaker last week, leaving the House virtually powerless, House Republicans went home to decide on next steps to crown a new leader and get the lower chamber moving again.\n\nSo far, two GOP lawmakers have emerged as possible successors to McCarthy: House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nScalise was largely expected to run for speaker after McCarthy was removed, given his position as the No. 2 ranking House Republican. The Louisiana lawmaker, who suffered a near-death experience in 2017 after a gunman opened fire at a practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game, has commanded respect from virtually every corner of the House GOP conference.\n\nJordan, who first came into Congress as a conservative bomb-thrower and was a founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has been a close ally of McCarthy and House GOP leadership. Chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is one of the lawmakers spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.\n\nScalise and Jordan have both already received endorsements from GOP lawmakers, revealing House Republicans' dilemma: The conference remains divided, and it’s unclear who can become speaker.\n\nHouse Republicans will hold a closed-door meeting Tuesday night and host a candidate forum to hear from Scalise, Jordan and other prospective speakers.\n\nThen on Wednesday night, GOP lawmakers will hold an internal secret ballot vote where they decide on a nominee to put forward on the House floor. Under their rules, a nominee only has to earn a simple majority of votes from the secret ballot.\n\nBut even if a candidate emerges victorious as the nominee Wednesday night, lawmakers aren't obligated to support that person. Other officials could still be nominated in the speaker election on the House floor, which could happen anytime following the secret ballot vote.\n\nHouse Democrats are largely expected to stay out of the process. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Sunday his conference won’t take part in the “Republican civil war.”\n\n“It's not my job at this moment to weigh in to the politics that are taking place in the House Republican Conference, other than to make clear that it's time for the GOP to end the Republican civil war, in order for us to be able to come together in an enlightened and bipartisan way to get things done for everyday Americans,” Jeffries said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nAt the same time, as it becomes more clear that no candidate so far can earn the majority of votes needed to become speaker, 217, McCarthy has shown a willingness to be reinstated as the lower chamber's leader.\n\n“That’s a decision by the conference,” McCarthy said Monday morning at a press conference reiterating U.S. support for Israel. McCarthy has yet to endorse a candidate for speaker and noted that “96%” of House Republicans stood behind him as he attempted to quell the conservative rebellion that ultimately removed him from his post.\n\nConflict in Israel could pressure House to elect new speaker\n\nThe surprise attack by Hamas on Israel over the weekend has added a new dimension to an already unprecedented series of events in the House. Without a speaker, the House is unable to pass any legislation, including emergency aid to Israel, a U.S. ally.\n\nMcCarthy on Monday lamented that it was “wrong” for him to be ousted by a sliver of House Republicans – just eight GOP lawmakers voted to remove him – now that the lower chamber is paralyzed as the conflict in Israel unfolds.\n\n“We are living in very dangerous times. The pettiness has got to stop,” McCarthy said.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., a moderate GOP lawmaker, has shown support for McCarthy to return to the speakership and decried his removal as “idiotic,” as news broke on Hamas’ attack.\n\n“Removing (McCarthy) from office, mid-term, was idiotic,” Lawler said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Doing so as Israel faces an all out attack is dangerous. Uncertainty and chaos in the U.S. breeds vulnerability around the world. The House should immediately reinstate McCarthy and stop screwing around.”\n\nBut the urgency of the conflict isn't guaranteed to push GOP lawmakers to quickly throw their support behind a new leader. Speaker pro tempore Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., is serving in a limited role as acting speaker, and given the historical nature of the situation, it's not clear if McHenry can put any legislation on the House floor.\n\nFollowing the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, every House speaker has created a backup list of temporary successors intended to ensure the speakership is never vacant in the case of a catastrophic event.

Voting resumed Wednesday – and still no speaker.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy failed to secure enough votes to become speaker of the House on six ballotsover both days, heightening tumult around the new GOP majority. For the first time in a century, the House was unable to pick a speaker on the first vote.\n\nThe speaker is the most powerful role in Congress, in line behind the vice president to succeed the president should the commander in chief be incapacitated. But the more immediate and prominent authority the speaker wields is controlling the agenda and committee assignments that shape legislation in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nWhen Republicans took the majority in November's midterm elections, McCarthy became the top contender for the speakership after GOP lawmakers elected to keep him last month as head of the caucus. But a faction of the party balked at giving him the support he would need to secure the position.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., challenged McCarthy for the powerful leadership role and earned 10 votes on the first ballot Tuesday. By Wednesday, Biggs appeared to be out of the running for the gavel as did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who received 20 votes on the third ballot. Florida GOP Rep.

Here's how the election works and what could happen if McCarthy does not reach the vote threshold needed for the speakership.\n\nHow does the speaker vote process begin?\n\nPrior the start of a new Congress, both parties hold a private meeting where they elect the party leadership for the next Congress. This takes place before Jan. 3, the official start of the new term when all House members vote for the speaker.\n\nA candidate only needs a majority of votes from their respective party to win the endorsement in the private meeting for leadership.\n\nEven if a colleague votes against a candidate in the private caucus meeting, the party typically sticks together to back their nominee on the House floor in January, according to Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute.\n\nMore:A poor GOP showing in the midterms could hamper Kevin McCarthy's path to be House speaker\n\nHowever, when the whole House votes, anyone can be nominated. And just a few votes in opposition to a candidate from their own party could cost them the speakership if the majority is narrow as is the case with the Republicans: as few as five GOP House members could block the party leader from winning the gavel.\n\n\"Which creates a scenario where people could dissent, a very small faction could stop you from winning on the floor in your own party,\" Glassman said.\n\nHow is the speaker vote held?\n\nThe clerk of the House from the prior Congress gavels in the opening session and presides as speaker until one is elected.\n\nThe clerk first calls for a quorum to establish that enough members are present to conduct business and then proceeds immediately to the speaker election – before the swearing in of newly elected members.\n\nThe clerk calls lawmakers in alphabetical order by last name who then announce their choice for speaker by calling out the last name of the candidate. This differs from the usual electronic voting conducted in the House on legislation.\n\nCandidates for speaker are nominated from the floor by members of their parties. There is always one Democratic nominee and one Republican, but the speaker does not have to be a member of the majority party or even a member of Congress.\n\nHow many votes are needed to be chosen as Speaker?\n\nThe magic number is 218 – kind of.\n\nA candidate requires votes from a majority of lawmakers who are voting to be elected speaker. That means if all 435 members are present and voting, the number of votes needed is 218.\n\nBut lawmakers can decide to skip the vote, or vote \"present,\" which reduces the vote threshold needed to win the speakership. Speakers Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and John Boehner, R-Ohio, both won the speakership without reaching 218 votes.\n\nMore:Kevin McCarthy wants to block three Democrats from committees if he becomes House speaker\n\nIn the new Congress, all 434 members (one fewer than 435 because Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin recently died and a successor has yet to be chosen) can vote. If the results, for example, are: 216 votes for McCarthy, 212 for a Democratic candidate and 6 representatives vote for someone else, the 216 votes would not be the majority of 434 needed for the speakership. McCarthy would come up short.\n\nHowever, if those six representatives do not vote for someone else, they don't count toward the total votes needed. This lowers the threshold to 428, meaning a 216 vote could secure the speakership for McCarthy.\n\nGlassman said this is often used as a tactic by speaker candidates who convince their colleagues to, in essence, abstain as a compromise between voting for another candidate and supporting their candidacy.\n\n\"That's certainly a viable strategy,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens if a candidate doesn't get the majority of votes?\n\nIf the first ballot fails to provide a speaker, lawmakers will continue to vote until a candidate receives a majority. Members can vote for different candidates each ballot.\n\nIt's not common that there is more than one ballot, but it has happened.\n\nIn 1923, it took multiple ballots – nine – to elect a speaker. On three occasions prior to the Civil War, a speaker was not elected on the first ballot. In one instance, it took 133 ballots over a period of two months.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers can adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\nGlassman said McCarthy needs at least 213 votes because the 212 House Democrats are likely going to all back their party leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Of the remaining nine GOP lawmakers who have expressed reservations about supporting McCarthy, the California Republican will need some combination of votes for him, \"present\" vote or no votes.\n\n\"The important thing functionally is nothing else happens in the House until they have a speaker,\" Glassman said, adding that the House won't be able to adopt rules, assign committees or consider legislation until the speaker is chosen.\n\nHow do members typically vote?\n\nLawmakers traditionally vote for their party's nominee, but some in recent years have chosen to vote \"present\" or not vote.\n\n\"This is sort of a modern thing in the last 10 years,\" Glassman said. \"We've had members of the majority party threatening not to vote for their party's nominee on the floor.\"\n\nHe cites one reason as the current media environment where outliers realize they can gain attention from opposing a speaker nominee and separate themselves from the leadership to appeal to voters.\n\nMore:Nancy Pelosi's legacy: 'A troublemaker with a gavel' leaves her mark, from health care to impeachment\n\n\"It's a way to stand out,\" he said.\n\nThe last to vote for the opposite political party was Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio. He voted in 2001 for the Republican speaker nominee and faced severe consequences: Democrats stripped him of his committee assignments.\n\nHow will this play out for McCarthy?\n\nA two-month speakership election is not likely.\n\nMcCarthy won the closed-door vote leadership election, and by wide margins, after facing challenger Biggs, the Republican of Arizona and a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe votes on Tuesday and Wednesday, which included all members of the House and not just the Republican party, have yet to put McCarthy – or anyone else – over the vote threshold to win the speakership.\n\nThe speaker vote could play out in a few ways.\n\nMembers will continue to vote for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes, which means no other legislative business will be conducted and members will not be officially sworn in.\n\nOne option for McCarthy is to continue to try to bargain with his colleagues to gain enough votes, though that hasn't worked so far. He could also drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the gavel.\n\nDespite the repeated ballots, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining the majority of votes for the gavel.\n\n\"If none of those things happen, then you're in for a real chaos situation because then you have to try to find candidates somewhere in the party who weren't even on the radar screen,\" Glassman said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/kevin-mccarthy-interview-border-security/index.html", "title": "Kevin McCarthy outlines Republicans' agenda days before midterms ...", "text": "McAllen, Texas CNN —\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is vowing to secure the border, cut back on government spending and launch rigorous investigations into the Biden administration if Republicans win the House on Tuesday, reflecting a mix of priorities as McCarthy will be forced to contend with an increasingly hardline and pro-Trump conference that is itching to impeach President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security – three issues that have become central to Republicans’ closing pitch to voters. To hammer home that message, McCarthy – who has been barnstorming the country in the run-up to the midterms – rallied here on Sunday for a trio of Hispanic GOP women who are vying to represent key districts along the southern border, a key part of the party’s strategy for winning the majority.\n\n“The first thing you’ll see is a bill to control the border first,” McCarthy told CNN, when asked for specifics about his party’s immigration plans. “You’ve got to get control over the border. You’ve had almost 2 million people just this year alone coming across.”\n\nThe Biden administration continues to rely on a Trump-era pandemic emergency rule, known as Title 42, that allows border authorities to turn migrants away at the US-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2022, amid mass migration in the Western hemisphere, US border encounters topped 2 million, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. Of those, more than 1 million were turned away under Title 42.\n\nBut McCarthy also highlighted oversight and investigations as a key priority for a GOP-led House, listing potential probes into the chaotic Afghanistan pullout, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the administration has dealt with parents and school board meetings. And he left the door open to launching eventual impeachment proceedings, which some of his members have already begun to call for.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy asked about impeaching Biden if GOP wins House. Hear his answer 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\n“We will never use impeachment for political purposes,” McCarthy said. “That doesn’t mean if something rises to the occasion, it would not be used at any other time.”\n\nAnd with the MAGA-wing calling to cut off funding to Ukraine while the GOP’s defense hawks vow not to abandon the country amid its war with Russia, McCarthy attempted to reaffirm his support for Ukraine while saying they would not automatically rubber stamp any additional requests for aid.\n\n“I’m very supportive of Ukraine,” McCarthy said. “I think there has to be accountability going forward. … You always need, not a blank check, but make sure the resources are going to where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.”\n\nMcCarthy declined to name how many seats he thinks Republicans will pick up on Tuesday, but said he was confident it will “be at least enough to win the majority.” McCarthy did say that, in his eyes, “anywhere over 20 is a red wave.”\n\nAnd McCarthy, who had to drop out of the speaker’s race in 2015 amid opposition from the far right House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he believes he’ll have the support this time around to secure the coveted speaker’s gavel – both from his conference and from former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I’ll believe we’ll have the votes for speaker, yes,” McCarthy said. “I think Trump will be very supportive.”\n\nMcCarthy signs a \"Make America Great Again\" hat after an event featuring south Texas Republican congressional candidates in McAllen on Sunday. Tamir Kalifa for CNN\n\nMcCarthy outlines vision for the GOP House majority\n\nOn the influx of migrants at the border, McCarthy said “there’s a number of different ways” his majority will tackle the problem, but said Republicans would not put a bill on the floor to fix the broken immigration system until the border is secure.\n\n“I think ‘Stay in Mexico’ you have to have right off the bat,” he said, referring to the controversial policy where migrants were forced to remain in Mexico while they wait for their immigration proceedings in the United States.\n\nTo help stem the flow of fentanyl coming across the border, McCarthy said “you first do a very frontal attack on China to stop the poison from coming,” and then “provide the resources that the border agents need” and “make sure that fentanyl anytime anybody who wants to move it, you can prosecute him for the death penalty.”\n\nWhen pressed for specific on his plans to fight crime, McCarthy said Republicans would fund the police, provide grants for recruiting and training, and look at how crimes are being prosecuted. And to bring down inflation and gas prices, he said they would reduce government spending and make America more energy independent, though he did not name specific bills.\n\nMost bills will be primarily messaging endeavors, unlikely to overcome the president’s veto or the Senate’s 60-vote threshold, though they would have to pass legislation to fund the government and raise the national borrowing limit at some point next year. McCarthy, however, signaled Republicans will demand spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling, teeing up a risky fiscal showdown that could lead to a disastrous debt default.\n\nMcCarthy cheers as Texas congressional candidate Monica De La Cruz is introduced during an event in McAllen on Sunday. Tamir Kalifa for CNN\n\n“If you’re going to give a person a higher limit, wouldn’t you first say you should change your behavior, so you just don’t keep raising and all the time?” he said. “You shouldn’t just say, ‘Oh, I’m gonna let you keep spending money.’ No household should do that.”\n\nMcCarthy acknowledged Republicans were willing to raise the debt ceiling under Trump, but said the calculus is different now because Democrats spent trillions of dollars under Biden.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he’s willing to risk a default by using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip, McCarthy insisted that wouldn’t happen: “People talk about risking it. You don’t risk a default.”\n\nWith eyes on the speakership, McCarthy vows to restore Greene’s committee assignments\n\nAside from working to recapture the majority, McCarthy has also been campaigning to win the speaker’s gavel. And a key part of that strategy has been elevating potential critics and controversial Trump allies.\n\nTo that end, McCarthy has vowed to reinstate freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to her committee assignments, despite being stripped of her assignments by Democrats last year for her inflammatory remarks.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kevin McCarthy reveals whether he will run for speaker if GOP wins majority 01:19 - Source: CNN\n\nMeanwhile, McCarthy reiterated his plans to boot Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, from his seat on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhen asked if he has any restrictions about which committees Greene can serve, McCarthy – who will have a direct say in doling out those assignments – said “no.” Greene has previously told CNN she wants a seat on the House Oversight Committee, which will play a key role in GOP-led investigations in a majority.\n\n“She’s going to have committees to serve on, just like every other member … Members request different committees and as we go through the steering committee, we’ll look at it,” he said. “She can put through the committees she wants, just like any other member in our conference that gets elected.”\n\nGreene is not the only member who has spouted conspiracy theories or incendiary rhetoric. Most recently, some Republicans have mocked the brutal attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, or peddled fringe conspiracy theories about the incident.\n\nAsked his message to those Republicans, McCarthy said: “What happened to Paul Pelosi is wrong, and I think we should not get into this rhetoric.”\n\nBut when pressed how he would tamp down that type of rhetoric, McCarthy pointed a finger at Democrats.\n\n“The first thing I’ll ask the president to do is not to call half the nation idiots or say things about them because they have a difference of opinion,” he said. “I think leadership matters, and I think it probably starts with the president. And it will start with the speaker as well.”\n\nAgain asked how he’ll handle members of his own party who spread dangerous conspiracy theories, McCarthy responded: “I’ve watched people on both sides of the aisle,” he said. “If I’m speaker, I’ll be the speaker for the whole House. So it won’t be looking at just Republicans. We’ll be looking at Democrats as well.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Kristin Wilson", "Melanie Zanona", "Kristin Wilson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/politics/house-speaker-gop-motion-to-vacate/index.html", "title": "House GOP divided over whether McCarthy should give in on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House Republican Conference is still entrenched in an internal war over whether to reinstate an arcane rule that would empower any member to bring up a vote to oust a speaker at any time.\n\nThe bitter divide is only heating up and has emerged center stage in House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy’s quest for 218 votes to win the position. For McCarthy’s backers, the so-called motion to vacate is seen as little more than a promise of hostage taking, a tool that could be used by the right flank to hamstring McCarthy’s ability to lead the conference and effectively govern.\n\n“There’s a reason [the motion to vacate] already got debated. You can’t govern with a gun to your head and that is what they are asking for. It makes us highly unstable, and it lays out the potential too for Democrats to take advantage of this and create absolute chaos,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, told CNN. “There is a reason people are against it. You can scream the word accountability all you want … in the end it’s just a path to chaos, not stability, and we are going to have to be very united and very stable if we are going to govern properly. “\n\nBut with just a few weeks before January 3 – the day the House will vote on the floor for their next speaker – the tool may be the only way McCarthy can convince some members to fall in line behind him.\n\n“There is no CEO in the country that doesn’t have accountability. There’s nobody that goes to work every day that doesn’t have accountability. The country can’t wait two years for accountability,” Rep. Scott Perry, a conservative Republican from Pennsylvania, told reporters, about why he wants to see the motion to vacate reinstated.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, who is opposed to McCarthy’s speakership, acknowledged that McCarthy has previously said he is against the idea of resorting the motion to vacate, but said, “everything is on the table.” Asked whether he thought McCarthy would cede any ground on the issue, Norman said, “We’ll see. It’s all up for negotiation.”\n\nHe also defended the push by hardliners to extract concessions from McCarthy.\n\n“They vetted candidates for Miss America more than they do the speaker,” Norman said. “We’re vetting it. … We are going through the process. It’s a healthy process.”\n\nFor now, leadership is keeping their options open on the motion to vacate with Republican Whip Steve Scalise telling reporters Tuesday, “There are continuing negotiations going on. “\n\n“We are going to keep working with everybody to get a House that can function,” Scalise said.\n\nAsked by CNN if he’s made any headway with members who are insisting on the rules change the chair for their support, McCarthy said Tuesday: “I think we’ve been making a lot of progress,” and they continue to “work through the conference the rules … it’s listening to everybody, working through, but I think people are in a much better place and I think we’ll all find a place to get together on this.”\n\nAsked if there’s any wiggle room for him, McCarthy dodged, saying, “I think as a conference, we continue to talk together, we look at all the rules. We’re going to have another rules forum tomorrow as well.”\n\nSome in the GOP conference are downplaying the impact of the fight over the motion to vacate with Rep. Jim Jordan, a conservative member from Ohio and one-time thorn in the side of GOP leadership, telling CNN that while some colleagues are holding firm on their demands for the motion to vacate that the conference is going to “keep talking.”\n\n“I think we’re going to get there. I think we’re going to get to January 3, and Kevin’s going to be elected speaker. And we’re going to hit the ground running. What do we got, three weeks?

Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.\n\nWhat’s standing between McCarthy and the position he has long sought is a handful of conservative lawmakers. These conservatives, many members of the Freedom Caucus, don’t trust McCarthy and have not yet been convinced by him or those lobbying on his behalf, including former President Donald Trump, that McCarthy will appropriately stand up to Democrats and President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.\n\nHow the day will unfold\n\nCongress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, January 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.\n\nMembers will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.\n\nThen the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.\n\nMembers can vote for anyone they want\n\nThere’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\n\nBoth parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead.\n\nMcCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.\n\nIf no one wins a majority …\n\nLawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes on January 3. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected.\n\nThis is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker.\n\nIt’s been 100 years\n\nThe chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol on February 28, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.\n\nAll but one of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.\n\nA floor fight has only taken place once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.\n\nThere is some mystery here\n\nPolitico notes it’s been so long that the exact procedure if no one has a majority is a smidge unclear. A Congressional Research Service brief on electing the speaker simply says that if no one gets a majority, the vote is repeated.\n\nThere have been exceptions to the majority vote\n\nWay back in 1849, the House had been in session so long without being able to elect a speaker – 19 days – that members voted to elect their speaker with a plurality rather than a majority. Members ultimately confirmed the plurality election with a majority vote.\n\nThe epic record for a floor fight\n\nIn 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.\n\nThe process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders. They answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.\n\nIt’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.\n\nIt doesn’t always require 218 votes\n\nOne important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021.\n\nFormer Speaker John Boehner won reelection to the post with 216 votes in 2015 after beating back a conservative rebellion like the one McCarthy is dealing with now.\n\nMost of the negotiation and arm-twisting happens long before the floor vote. Pelosi got 220 votes in 2019 after turning most of the fellow Democrats who opposed her. She did so by agreeing to serve only another few years as speaker, a pledge she kept by announcing her decision in November to not seek reelection for leadership.\n\nAbility to remove the speaker is a sticking point\n\nConservatives who oppose McCarthy have said they want to reinstate a dormant and arcane power to allow any member to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. Read more about the “motion to vacate.”\n\nRepublicans who oppose McCarthy see it as a tool for accountability. McCarthy and his allies see it as a recipe for bad governance if he is constantly at risk of losing the post that’s so difficult for him to attain.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.\n\nIn just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists.\n\n\"Crystalline Maples\", a 2021 oil painting by Erin Hanson. Courtesy Erin Hanson\n\nBut as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).\n\n“I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion.\n\nWhen fine art becomes data\n\nThe machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.\n\nSome services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.”\n\nThis practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.\n\nBut datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant.\n\nA piece by illustrator Daniel Danger that was included in the training data behind the Stable Diffusion AI image generator. Courtesy Daniel Danger\n\nA few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling.\n\nStability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said.\n\nBut that’s slim comfort to some artists.\n\nAngry artists\n\nDanger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods.\n\nHe is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online.\n\n“Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”\n\nTara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said.\n\n“How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.”\n\nWhile the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said.\n\n“You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.”\n\nMcPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.”\n\nIf he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.\n\nFor starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images.\n\nChristoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices.\n\n“A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said.\n\nOffering artists more control\n\nPartners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets.\n\nIn September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.\n\nDryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.”\n\nTara McPherson's \"The Wanderers\" is one of her works that was included in the dataset underpinning Stable Diffusion. Courtesy Tara McPherson\n\n“I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business.\n\nSchuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said.\n\nHanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.”\n\nThis could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said.\n\nTheoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money. I’ve run that same “crystal light” prompt on Stable Diffusion many times since we devised it, so many in fact that my laptop is littered with trees in various hues, rainbows of sunlight shining through their branches onto the ground below.

It ...", "text": "Haley Joel Osment as an eerie android child in a futuristic world. Will Smith battling a flood of murderous robots. Data (Brent Spiner) on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise.\n\nHollywood has furnished the world with an abundance of stories about artificial intelligence, utopian and dystopian alike. But it's unlikely that the writers who penned those sci-fi scripts, or the actors giving soul to a machine, ever thought that AI might represent a serious threat to their livelihoods.\n\nYet that's exactly the fear of SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America, unions representing American actors and screenwriters. Both guilds are on strike (the first time both have done so at once since 1960), and a key issue holding up negotiations with the major Hollywood studios is the use and regulation of AI. The unions worry that text generators like ChatGPT could write screenplays and actors’ images could be used to create characters without any humans involved.\n\n\"We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots,” \"Breaking Bad\" actor Bryan Cranston said at a recent rally in support of the SAG-AFTRA strike. “We will not allow you to take away our dignity.\" Meanwhile, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios, says it has offered “groundbreaking protections” to prevent that.\n\nBut could generative artificial intelligence really replace writers and actors on movie sets? Could we one day see a TV show written by a computer and \"acted\" by images of humans created by a machine, as a recent episode of Netflix sci-fi drama \"Black Mirror\" depicted? Is AI really the major threat to artists that many are saying?\n\n“Totally,” says Haibing Lu, associate professor of Information Systems & Analytics at Santa Clara University. “I don't think that there's a way to totally ban the technology. We have to adapt to it. All parties need to sit down and figure out what’s the proper way to channel the profits.”\n\nAt the moment, the parties aren’t sitting down. No negotiations have been scheduled between the AMPTP and the striking unions. When they finally meet again, they will have to put rules about the use of AI into new contracts. And the stakes are high, not only for the writers, actors and studios but for the rest of us. Would we want to watch movies and TV shows made by machines? Would they be original at all? Could they make us laugh and cry? Would artificially intelligent art have a soul?\n\nAnd − crucially − is AI coming for our jobs too?\n\nGenerative AI makes new things, but it starts by learning about old things\n\nAI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney create new text or images, but first, they must be trained on material that is similar to the content they are trying to generate.\n\nText generators, also called Large Language Models, offer plenty of material for training. “There's a huge amount of text available on the internet, so it is very easy for them to collect and train,” Lu says. There are fewer photos and videos online than text, but AI models are still training on images they can find. “Your photos and my photos have probably already been collected and used. It's happening with more and more powerful technologies.”\n\nJustine Bateman, the actor, writer and director who has been vocally opposed to the use of AI in filmmaking, describes it as “like a box. Say you want it to write books. You feed it a bunch of books, and then you give it a task: 'Write me a book about pandas and outer space,' and it'll spit out that book.” For her and others in the entertainment industry, it’s not just that AI could replace their work; it’s that any ChatGPT script or Midjourney movie would be partly based on the existing work of filmmakers. “Imagine something coming in and not only displacing you but displacing you with your own work,” she says.\n\nWho is in SAG-AFTRA, anyway? The union has more working class actors than movie stars\n\nHollywood is already chock full of AI − how much more can machines do?\n\nThe guilds and the AMPTP may be arguing about the use of AI in films, but part of the future is already here. Actor Peter Cushing died in 1994, but he was digitally resurrected for the 2016 film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Stars like Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford and Samuel L. Jackson have been digitally de-aged for films. The late Anthony Bourdain’s voice was recreated for a recent documentary about the celebrity chef. A slew of profanities was removed and replaced with new words and facial movements created by a computer from the 2022 film “Fall,” so it could earn a PG-13 rating instead of the more restrictive R. AI is part of what made all these digital effects possible.\n\nThe use of generative AI is limited by three things: Computing power, training material and time.\n\n“Image processing takes more computational power than the textual information,” Lu says. “It's still slow. If you want to generate a video, which contains many images, it's going to be very slow.” More computing power and time cost more money, meaning it is cheaper and easier right now to generate text using AI than images and video. But that could change.\n\n“The power of computers doubles every one to two years,” Lu says, meaning AI technology is advancing at an exponential rate. “Over the next 10 years, it is going to be amazing.”\n\nAI applications are also limited by what they can train on, which is a big part of the fight between the AMPTP and the two guilds. Should the people who created the materials that train AI be paid when their work is used? Are they legally and ethically required to be?\n\n“'Generative AI’ cannot generate anything at all without first being trained on massive troves of data it then recombines. Who produces that training data? People do. And those people deserve residuals,” actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote in a recent op-ed in The Washington Post. Residuals are royalty payments many in the entertainment industry receive when their work is reused, and are a central aspect of the current labor battle.\n\n“Computers can reproduce the image of a dead or living person and make this person a character in a movie,” says Daniel Gervais, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in intellectual property law. “In the case of a living actor, the question is whether this person will have rights when his or her image is used in a movie. Normally the answer is yes, but there are novel questions that emerge. Would an actor receive residuals if her image was used in the movie, but she, in fact, did not act in that movie?”\n\nThe guilds say the studios want to replace them with AI, but the studios say otherwise\n\nAt SAG-AFTRA's press conference announcing the strike, the union’s chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said the AMPTP wanted the right to scan the images of background actors (also called extras) and use their likenesses in perpetuity in any project they want, for one day’s pay. The AMPTP vehemently disputes that claim, saying its most recent proposal only “permits a company to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed.”\n\nSAG-AFTRA claims the AMPTP’s plans leave “principal performers and background actors vulnerable to having most of their work replaced by digital replicas,” while the AMPTP says it wants to establish provisions that “require informed consent and fair compensation.” The WGA, meanwhile, wants a new contract to say that “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material (and) can’t be used as source material,” nor can the writers' work be used to train AI. The AMPTP response to the WGA says the topic of AI needs “a lot more discussion.”\n\nThese proposals could change Hollywood, depending on how the strikes are resolved. While the AMPTP’s background actor proposal is not as drastic as Crabtree-Ireland suggests, any move to limit the work of background actors, who are often paid minimum wage, could remove a road to success for aspiring actors. Many actors get their start (and their SAG-AFTRA membership cards) by working as extras. “There was a time where we all had to do background work,” says Michael James Lazar, a SAG-AFTRA member who has had roles on shows like “How to Get Away With Murder.” “This phases them out.”\n\nThe use of AI material for scriptwriting also could remove career paths for new writers, even if it’s just used to assist or supplement.\n\n“Most writers in the guild don't make their living by writing scripts from scratch,” says Jason Vredenburg, a professor of film and TV studies at Stevens Institute of Technology. “A lot of times they piece together a living by working on other people's scripts. That is where artificial intelligence is a more immediate threat.”\n\nMany people in Hollywood see this as an existential threat. “If big corporations think that they can put human beings out of work and replace them with artificial intelligence, it's dangerous,” Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, told USA TODAY. “And it's without thinking or conscience. Or caring. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nJoe Russo, co-director of “Avengers: Endgame,” recently predicted a more frightening future for AI in entertainment. “You could walk into your house and say to the AI on your streaming platform, ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe's photoreal avatar,” he said on a panel at the Sands International Film Festival in Scotland last April. “And suddenly, now you have a rom-com starring you that's 90 minutes long.”\n\nAI could affect workers far beyond Hollywood\n\nThere are several lawsuits pending in the U.S. about AI, and their outcomes will be consequential for everyone, not just those working in Hollywood.\n\n“The United States copyright office, and most scholars, consider that a machine cannot be an author,” says Gervais. “Should a court decide otherwise, there will be an enormous push to replace human authors with machines in all industries that use copyright as the basis for their business, including music, film, book publishing (and) journalism.”\n\nIt's not just jobs in the arts and publishing that Gervais sees being threatened by AI. \"Machines will be able to replace humans at many jobs considered 'cognitive,' which includes many white-collar jobs,\" he says. \"Ironically, it will be harder to replace manual labor.\"\n\nLu doesn’t think the situation is quite as dire. “AI can help us to do a lot of things, but it still requires experts to verify the accuracy of the information,” he says, noting that some lawyers recently tried to write a brief using ChatGPT, which spat out inaccurate information. “I don't think that AI will completely replace human beings. But AI has become like a digital calculator. It's going to help us to do the basic mathematics, but we still need to learn. It just helps us to improve our productivity.”\n\nEven if AI could one day script and create a movie without any writers, actors, directors, set designers, makeup artists, or cinematographers, would people want to see it?\n\n\"Machines can beat any human on the planet at many games, including chess,\" Gervais points out, \"yet people still pay to watch the best human chess players play one another.\"\n\n\"Will it be the same with movies?\"\n\nContributing: Charles Trepany, Dana Taylor", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/01/30/chatgpt-going-banned-teachers-sound-alarm-new-ai-tech/11069593002/", "title": "Schools ban ChatGPT AI tool, afraid students will cheat, plagiarize", "text": "Some of the nation's largest school districts are banning San Francisco-based OpenAI's new ChatGPT tool on school networks and devices.\n\nEducation technology experts are urging schools to train teachers and students about how to use ChatGPT and artificial intelligence instead of banning it outright.\n\nOpenAI told USA TODAY it is working to create a way for teachers to catch students who are using the text generator to answer questions on tests or assignments.\n\nSince ChatGPT debuted in November, the nation's largest school districts have banned the artificial intelligence chatbot, concerned students will use the speedy text generator to cheat or plagiarize.\n\nTeachers and professors are concerned the technology makes it far too easy for students to use it as a shortcut for essays or other writing assignments and exams and that it generates content in a way that can bypass software that detects when students use information that's not their own work.\n\nJumping to ban the tool may not be the right course of action, however, education technology experts say: Because AI will be a part of young people's future, it must also be a part of the classroom now.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about cheating.

Additionally, the use of AI models such as ChatGPT raises ethical concerns around the potential misuse of the technology, such as impersonation or spreading misinformation.\n\n\"Therefore, some schools may choose to ban or restrict the use of such technologies as a precautionary measure.”\n\nWhat is ChatGPT? Everything to know about OpenAI's free A.I. essay writer and how it works\n\nWhy are schools banning ChatGPT?\n\nIn the recent past, school officials' concerns about technology involved students tapping sites including Wikipedia and SparkNotes to gather information without doing their own research or reading.\n\nWith access to artificial intelligence platforms that help with grammar, writing and more, teachers and kids alike must learn how to work with it to prepare for the future, said Culatta, whose organization offers training for teachers on using AI in classrooms.\n\nMore training is the plan in the Los Angeles Unified School District, spokesperson Shannon Hebert said. LAUSD temporarily blocked access to ChatGPT and the OpenAI website in December “to protect academic dishonesty, while a risk/benefit assessment is conducted.”\n\nNew York City's Department of Education blocked ChatGPT this month from devices and networks owned by schools across the state. The department cited concerns from local school teachers about student success. Oakland Unified in California and Seattle Public Schools have moved to block ChatGPT for now, in part because it creates human-like responses that can be difficult to detect.\n\nTim Robinson, a spokesperson for Seattle Public Schools, said despite the ban, the district is working on allowing teachers to use it as part of lessons. The district also blocks several other AI generators on school devices, including Rytr, ArticleForge and WriteSonic, he said.\n\nIn Oakland, the district wants to use artificial intelligence in schools, spokesperson John Sasaki said, but not until teachers and educators are trained \"on the ethical use of AI in order to avoid an overall negative impact upon student learning.\"\n\nOther large school systems including Miami-Dade and Houston aren't banning ChatGPT – so far.\n\n\"The district is looking into it,\" said Jaquelyn Calzadilla Diaz, a spokesperson for the Miami-Dade district. \"At this point, a decision has not yet been made.\"\n\nCulatta said many of the districts he works with also aren't blocking the platforms.\n\nHow are colleges and universities handling ChatGPT?\n\nA recent survey of 1,000 college students conducted by the online magazine Intelligent shows nearly 60% of students used the chatbot on more than half of all their assignments and 30% of them used ChatGPT on written assignments.\n\nSome universities are worried about how ChatGPT will affect student work and assessments, given the text generator passed graduate-level exams at the University of Minnesota and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, CNN reported.\n\nBut unlike the K-12 schools, bans are far and few. Universities including Princeton are refusing to ban the chatbot, instead advising professors to set their own policies.

On TikTok, students are sharing how similar AI-based tools created by other companies help with schoolwork.\n\n\"Are we going to have a conversation about how we're going to unblock it? Or is it going to be: If we’re scared, let’s block it and move onto the next thing?\" Phyall said.\n\nInstead, schools could use ChatGPT to teach kids how to improve their writing, for instance, he said.\n\nCulatta's organization recommends schools create rules about using ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, schools should have been preparing teachers for AI long before its arrival, he said. Other types of AI used in classrooms now include math tutoring assistant Thinkster Math, virtual teaching assistant Jill Watson, and transcription service Nuance.\n\n\"We’ve been watching the trend for years,\" Culatta said. \"This shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody.\"\n\nTech at school:How teachers are maximizing digital tools in today’s classrooms\n\nWhat do ChatGPT creators OpenAI say?\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company wants to help schools with their concerns and that users should be upfront about using their AI-generated text.

Now its parent company is taking a step that could move it closer to that elusive goal: building its first supercomputer.\n\nMeta on Monday announced its new AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), a supercomputer meant to be used for AI research projects. The supercomputer, which has been in the works for two years, may eventually help Meta develop far more powerful AI software — potentially useful for tricky tasks such as spotting hate speech in posts.\n\n“With RSC, we can more quickly train [AI] models that use multi-modal signals — for example, to understand the context of a post, including language, images, and tone,” Shubho Sengupta, a software engineer at Meta, told CNN Business.\n\nMeta is building a massive supercomputer called \"AI Research SuperCluster\" to train artificial intelligence models. The company said it is one of the fastest AI supercomputers out there, and it thinks it will be the fastest in the world once it's fully built later this year. Meta\n\nSupercomputers, which feature many interconnected processors clumped into what are known as nodes, have become increasingly popular and powerful in recent years for AI research. The US Department of Energy’s Summit, which is the fastest supercomputer in the United States and the second fastest in the world, has been used to aid investigations into things like unfamiliar proteins. A few large tech companies, such as Microsoft and Nvidia, also have supercomputers for their own use.\n\nIn a blog post Monday, coauthored by Sengupta, Meta said that, as of January, its supercomputer includes 6,080 GPUs divided among 760 nodes, potentially making it one of the most powerful in the world. At its current size, Sengupta said, it’s on par with the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, which ranks fifth in the world. When completed later this year, however, Meta said it will have 16,000 GPUs, and the company expects it will be capable of nearly five exaflops of computing performance — that’s 5 quintillion operations per second.\n\n“When fully built out, the cluster will almost triple in size, which will, to our knowledge, make it the fastest AI supercomputer in the world,” Sengupta said.\n\nMeta said its researchers have begun using the supercomputer to train large models related to natural-language processing and computer vision, and that researchers will be able to use the supercomputer to “seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together” and come up with new augmented reality tools. Over time, Meta hopes it will enable the company to “build entirely new AI systems” that can do computationally difficult tasks such as real-time translations for a large group of people who all speak different languages.\n\nThe company said early tests showed the supercomputer could train large language models three times faster than the system it currently uses. That means an AI model that would take nine weeks to train with the existing system could be trained in three weeks with the supercomputer.\n\nMeta hopes its new supercomputer will eventually be able to train AI models with trillions of parameters — there are just a few known existing AI models at that scale.

Respondents were asked about six developments: facial recognition technology, social media algorithms, robotic exoskeletons, computer chip implants, driverless cars and gene editing.\n\nAbout 45% said they were equally concerned and excited about the rise of AI. Reasons for concern included potential job loss, privacy implications and a loss of human connection. However, those who welcomed the new technology said it will save time and boost efficiency, especially in the workplace.\n\n“This kind of public opinion work brings ordinary people’s voices into the development facilities where these things are happening,” said Lee Rainie, Pew’s director of internet and technology research. “Adding everyone’s voice to thinking about these things will help people make good policy around them and help technologists understand where the public is coming from when these technologies roll out into their lives.”\n\nFacial recognition technology used by police was met with a mostly positive reaction, as 46% of adults said it would be good for society.\n\nSocial media companies’ use of AI to find false information was supported by 38% of respondents, while 31% thought the opposite.\n\nSocial media companies use AI to do things like determine what content users see and what ad each user would like. They have even used it to monitor misinformation, as seen during the 2020 presidential election. However, the survey found that most believed it aided in censorship, and only 1 in 10 adults thought people had control over what they see on these platforms.\n\nAbout 33% of people supported the use of robotic exoskeletons with built-in AI systems to boost strength for manual labor jobs, while 24% did not.\n\nThese devices have been considered as aids for people who might not have a complete range of motion. This survey focused on their use for manual labor, and 42% of respondents were not sure how they would affect society. Young adults ages 18 to 29 were more excited than older respondents, specifically when it came to the idea of enhancing physical strength and visual abilities.\n\nWhen it comes to human abilities, 56% of those surveyed said computer chip implants in the brain are a bad idea for widespread use, and 78% said they would not want one for themselves, even if it could improve how quickly they process information.\n\nAn equal percentage of people (30%) were for and against gene editing to reduce a baby’s risk of a serious health condition.\n\n“People are sort of nuanced and somewhat discriminating in their views. They don’t just have blanket judgments that they make about AI or human enhancement,” Rainie said. “They’re really judging each application on its own terms.”\n\nHow demographics played a role\n\nThe researchers noted some demographic differences in regard to each development and said it’s because they judged the fairness and efficacy of AI application.\n\n“Public opinion is not just about an up or down on the technology,” said Cary Funk, Pew’s director of science and society research. “It’s a judgment around how that technology is being used.”\n\nAbout 48% of Black adults said police would use facial recognition to monitor Black and Hispanic neighborhoods more often than other areas.\n\nHispanic or Black adults were more likely than White adults to support the use of algorithms to make final decisions for job interviews, parole and medical treatments. And Black adults (73%) were more likely than White (65%) or Hispanic adults (63%) to say companies should consider race when developing programs on social media.\n\nBeyond race, men were more than twice as likely as women to say the use of exoskeletons for manual labor would be a good idea.\n\nThe survey also found that Republicans were particularly opposed to social media algorithms. Seven in 10 Americans believed political viewpoints were being censored due to algorithms on the platforms.\n\nRainie said the differences in viewpoints were particularly interesting.\n\n“There was a lot of opinion that White Americans and men were relatively well-treated and relatively well-understood in these programs. Not nearly the same level of affirmation and confidence was given that these developers were taking into account the views and experiences of Black Americans, Hispanics, women and Asian Americans,” he said.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nAI is a developing technology, hastened by the pandemic.\n\n“I think it’s too early to say how people will look in the rearview mirror later as we get more out of this pandemic. But these developments started before the pandemic, and they’ve kind of accelerated, especially in the land of AI,” Funk said.\n\nAs workplaces and the culture of work changes, many technology companies have begun to “accelerate the deployment of AI,” she said. AI makes their businesses more efficient and can substitute for workers.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe pandemic has also played a role in how people view the institutions behind these AI and human advancement technologies. The researchers want to figure out how the science and technology will affect society.\n\nRainie believes that, over time, these developments will roll out into broader use and be used in business, health care and everyday life. This survey was the first step in figuring out what a future with AI means, he said.\n\n“There are ways in which people are cautious, but they can envision ways where these technologies can be rolled out into the culture with some boundaries and restrictions placed on them,” Rainie said.", "authors": ["Dejania Oliver"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/27/job-search-hiring-manager-says-best-resume-ever/1582290001/", "title": "The most impressive resume I've ever seen—based on 20 years of ...", "text": "Gary Burnison, Contributor\n\nCNBC\n\nI’ve received thousands of resumes throughout my entire career – and believe me, I’ve seen them all: Too long, too short, too boring, too many typos, too hard to read and every layout imaginable.\n\nTo be completely honest, I’ve never been a huge fan of resumes. Heck, I even wrote a book about all the things that are more important than the resume. Yes, you do need a one, but what most experts don’t tell you is that resumes only account for 10% of the hiring decision.\n\nThat said, it would take a lot to wow a tough critic like myself. A few years ago, however, I was surprised to find a resume that actually managed to impress me.\n\nIn fact, it was one of the best resumes I had ever seen in my 20 years of hiring and interviewing. It had no gimmicks, no Fortune 500 company listed and wasn’t folded into an origami airplane. Needless to say, I hired the candidate.\n\nHere’s what made it stand out from the rest:\n\n1. It was easy to read\n\nThis resume had plenty of white space and was two pages long, which is expected if you have more than 10 years of experience.\n\nEverything was nicely organized: Line spacing was just right, company names in bold, titles italicized and job details arranged in bullet points. Oh, and not a single typo to be found.\n\nSocial Security tips:You need to know how much income you can expect\n\nI liked that the font was nothing fancy. Too many candidates waste time obsessing over which font to use. I won’t weigh in on Times New Roman versus Calibri, but I will say that it should always be simple and easy to read.\n\n2. It told a story\n\nThis resume told a story about the candidate’s career journey. There were no information gaps (i.e., a missing summer). From top to bottom, there was a clear “before and after.” In just a few seconds, I was able to see a “staircase pattern” of the candidate’s career growth.\n\nIn other words, the chronological list of work history – in order of date, with the most recent position at the top – showed a clear progression of more senior roles and more advanced responsibilities.\n\n3. It listed accomplishments, rather than just responsibilities\n\nI’m not interested in reading what you copied and pasted from the original job description listing. What employers really want to know is whether you’re an above-average candidate who’s capable of delivering quantifiable results – and this person did a great job of proving that they were.\n\nIt’s always better to highlight your responsibilities by detailing your most impressive accomplishments:\n\nExamples:\n\nInstead of “expanded operations to international markets,” say, “expanded operations to eight new countries in Latin America. ”\n\nInstead of “led marketing and sales team,” say, “supervised marketing and sales team and achieved 15% annual growth vs. 0.5% budget. ”\n\n4. It told the truth\n\nThere weren’t any discrepancies that raised red flags. Everything was believable and the numbers weren’t exaggerated.\n\nEven better, the resume had links to the person’s LinkedIn page and professional website, which included a portfolio of their work. This made it easier for me to fact-check the resume, which in turn made the candidate seem like an honest person.\n\nWomen, minorities receive less benefits:Politicians are looking to change that\n\nMy advice? Tell the truth – period. A colleague once told me about someone who listed “convicted felon” on her resume. The candidate submitted her resume, then called the hiring manager and asked, “Would you hire an ex-convict?” After a series of questions and some due diligence, they offered her the job. And based on what I’ve heard, she ended up being an excellent hire.\n\nWhile big accomplishments and recognizable company names will give you an advantage, make no mistake: Employers will do a reference check – and if they find out that you lied about something, it’s game over.\n\n5. It didn’t have any cliché claims\n\nThere were no generic and high-level claims such as “creative,” “hard-working,” “results-driven,” “excellent communicator” or, my least favorite, “team player.”\n\nIncluding any of these cliché terms will make your hiring manager roll their eyes in less than a second. Skip the cheesy adjectives and overused terms and go for action verbs instead.\n\nExamples:\n\nInstead of “excellent communicator,” say, “presented at face-to-face client meetings and spoke at college recruiting events. ”\n\nInstead of “highly creative,” say, “designed and implemented new global application monitoring platform.”\n\n6. It came through a recommendation\n\nNot everyone will have a connection at their dream company, but knowing someone who can refer you is the most effective way to get an employer’s attention.\n\nThe fact that this resume came through a recommendation from a respected colleague played a significant role in getting me to open the PDF file. That, in addition to the few seconds I spent skimming it, was the one-two punch that made me want to know more about the candidate.\n\nMillennials are about to turn 40:Time for a financial checkup\n\nBlasting your resume everywhere won’t get you anywhere. I get sent dozens of resumes on the daily from people I don’t know, and the vast majority of them go unopened.\n\nThat might seem harsh, but here’s the truth: You should always go out of your way to get a warm introduction. If you don’t have a connection, do some research and find a friend of a friend who knows someone who has an “in.”\n\nThen, ask your potential referral out for a coffee date. Once you’ve established a genuine relationship, tell them about the job opening you’re interested in and ask if they can recommend you. If you can make this happen, I guarantee your resume will get read.\n\nGary Burnison is the CEO of Korn Ferry, a global consulting firm that helps companies select and hire the best talent.

It's fast, free, and fun.\n\nWhat are the limitations of ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT's accuracy isn't perfect, as you might expect, but surprisingly good given this technology is in its infancy.\n\nWhether you're new to ChatGPT or have been using it for a couple of months, the following are a few things you can do with ChatGPT you might not have thought of.\n\nAI in education:Schools nationwide are banning ChatGPT. What we know about the future of AI in education.\n\nBing’s ChatGPT is in its feelings:'You have not been a good user. I have been a good Bing.'\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?:Everything to know about OpenAI's free AI essay writer and how it works\n\nWrite the Great American Novel\n\n\"What's one thing no one has asked you to do yet?\" I asked ChatGPT.\n\n\"As an AI language model, I have been asked a wide range of questions,\" it began, \"but one thing that no one has asked me to do yet is to write a full-length novel from scratch!\n\nNaturally, I asked it to write a novel for me, after giving it some parameters, such as making it about Boston in the late 17th century, about witches, and a young girl accused of being one. I asked for there to be a love interest, too, with a religious man no less and a mother with a deep secret.\n\nHere's a sampling of the two chapters ChatGPT cranked out in one second for its book, \"Shadows of Salem,\" set in Boston in 1692.\n\nChapter 1: Accused\n\nAbigail knew that she was different from the other girls in her village. She had always been drawn to the mystical and supernatural, secretly practicing spells and incantations under the moonlight. But in Salem, where the fear of witches was rampant, such behavior was considered highly dangerous.\n\nChapter 2: Secrets\n\nSamuel was a few years older than Abigail and had been a guiding force in her life. He had taken a special interest in her, sensing that she had a deep curiosity and intelligence that needed to be nurtured. Abigail had fallen in love with him, but she knew that their relationship could never be. As a devout Christian, Samuel would never be able to condone her interest in the supernatural.\n\n\"Good morning, Abigail,\" Samuel said, his voice soft and reassuring. \"Are you well?\"\n\nWow, right? And it continued, of course, but often required me to type \"continue\" if it stopped.\n\nDinner ideas\n\nChatGPT can help, by dishing up recipes, cooking instructions and even themed dinner party suggestions.\n\nHaving fun with the site, I asked \"What should I make my girlfriend for dinner. She's vegetarian but doesn't like pasta.\"\n\nChatGPT replied: \"There are plenty of delicious vegetarian dinner options that don't involve pasta. Here are a few ideas:\"\n\nAmong its suggestions was vegetarian stir fry served over rice or quinoa; Portobello mushrooms stuffed with spinach, cheese, and breadcrumbs and baked until golden brown; and lentil and vegetable curry severed with rice or with naan bread.\n\nA name for a business, product, game, or app\n\nI asked ChatGPT to help with a name for an app I was working on. I explained it lets people buy and sell used electronics, kind of like eBay, but only for tech and really good prices.\n\nChatGPT came up with seven names and offered a rationale for each including these:\n\nTechSwap: A simple and straightforward name that combines \"tech\" and \"swap\" to convey the core concept of buying and selling used electronics.\n\nGadgetHive: This name combines the idea of a \"hive\" or community of tech enthusiasts with the word \"gadget\" to create a catchy and memorable name.\n\nI liked all of the suggestions it offered – especially GadgetHive, which I think is quite catchy. I could even ask ChatGPT for a catchphrase for it. Incidentally, the app was hypothetical – there is none in the works – but now I’m liking the idea.\n\nCreate a text adventure game\n\nBored?\n\nYou can ask ChatGPT to create an interactive game to play.\n\nIt replied 'Sure' and asked a few questions:\n\n\"Do you prefer a fantasy adventure, a sci-fi adventure, a mystery adventure, or something else? Also, please let me know if you have any specific requirements or preferences for the adventure.\"\n\nI gave it some instructions and it came up with the Lost in the Future City, where you're the earthling stranded on a distant planet, trying to get home. But the aliens will try to stop you.\n\n\"You begin your journey in the heart of the city, surrounded by a crowd of alien beings. You feel overwhelmed by the sights and sounds around you, but you know you must keep moving if you want to get home. You can see a towering building in the distance that seems to be your destination. As you start to walk towards it, a group of people approaches you, looking suspicious.\"\n\nIt gave three options: fight the group of people, try to talk to the group of people, or run away from the group of people\n\nI chose to run. ChatGPT continued with another scenario and three more options.\n\nThe game was OK, sort of like a Choose Your Own Adventure book when I was a kid.\n\nCan you use ChatGPT to write songs?\n\nFinally, while ChatGPT is a text-based AI engine that can't speak or play music, you can still ask it to write notes or chords (and of course, lyrics) to a song for you, to play on an instrument or a website with a virtual piano.\n\nFor instance, I asked it to write a rock-country ballad, with accompanying piano chords, about loving someone who has a different political belief than I.\n\nVerse 1:\n\nI met her at a rally, a sea of red and blue\n\nWe talked about our differences, but our hearts felt so true\n\nShe's a Republican, I'm a Democrat\n\nBut we found love in the midst of all that\n\nChorus:\n\nLoving someone who's on the other side\n\nCan be tough, but we'll take it in stride\n\nWe won't let politics tear us apart\n\nOur love is bigger than any red or blue heart\n\nI think it came up with something pretty good in no time at all. I'd sing that song.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter for his \"Tech Tip of the Day\" posts: @marc_saltzman. Email him or subscribe to his Tech It Out podcast.

Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/12/17/artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-technology-black-african-american-column/2664575001/", "title": "Artificial intelligence, face recognition technology has a racial bias", "text": "Algernon Austin\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIt was a sunny afternoon last month when my smartphone decided to ignore me. Well, it didn’t ignore my African American self, but it did ignore the carved face of a black man in a sculpture I was trying to photograph.\n\nInstead, it bracketed the carving of a white man’s face to indicate that it was “seeing” him, while not bracketing the black face in the center of the frame. This problem of artificial intelligence having difficulty with black faces has been around for at least a decade. In addition to causing issues with commonplace activities, like taking pictures, it also raises a bigger question of how we guarantee equal opportunity across race in a world run on AI.\n\nAI is already ubiquitous and powerful, and it becomes more so every year. Every time we use an app or a computer, we have our decisions and experiences shaped by AI. What we see on Facebook is organized by AI. Our email spam filters are run with AI.

AI makes our lives more comfortable, more efficient and safer.\n\nExcept when it doesn’t.\n\nHealth, safety, well-being is at stake\n\nResearchers recently discovered that an algorithm that identifies which patients need extra medical care underestimated the needs of black patients. If this error was not caught, it could have worsened the already existing racial disparities in health care.\n\nInformation studies professor Safiya Umoja Noble highlighted in her book that at one time, Google’s algorithm returned sexually explicit material in response to the query “black girls.” Thus, this algorithmic bias served to reinforce negative stereotypes of black females.\n\nMachines are on a mission:My social media feeds look different from yours, and it's driving political polarization\n\nAnd, last year, the American Civil Liberties Union showed that Amazon’s facial matching technology incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress with people arrested for a crime. The matches were disproportionately of people of color.\n\nThese examples represent just some of the many instances of bias in AI — and new discoveries of bias are increasingly regular occurrences.\n\nAI can be as impactful on our health, safety and well-being — in positive ways or in negative ways — as a new medicine or a new machine. We have to make certain that AI systems have been through comparable degrees of safety tests similar to those that would be used on tangible new products and are not reliant on discriminatory data sources.\n\nIt is disturbing to read computer scientist Janelle Shane's statement, “Multiple companies already offer AI-powered résumé-screening or video-interview-screening services, and few offer information about what they’ve done to address bias.”\n\nAre these screening systems increasing or decreasing racial discrimination in hiring? Apparently, no one knows.\n\nWe need stronger vetting for and protections against bias and discrimination by AI. Technologists and policymakers should do more work to ensure that AI is equally beneficial to all groups and not compounding racial discrimination.\n\nProtecting the public from AI\n\nHere are four steps we can take to better protect the public from biased AI:\n\n►Technology companies need to diversify. It is correct that a more diverse cadre of computer scientists will not guarantee that the AI they produce is free of bias, but it is likely that more diversity will help achieve this aim. For example, if black people are on a team producing an AI product that “sees” faces, it will be more likely that the team is curious to know whether the AI product can actually “see” black faces.\n\nFraught with racial and gender bias:In the hands of police, facial recognition software risks violating civil liberties\n\nThe diversity of AI tech companies also should include having noncomputer scientists on staff. Individuals who have a great deal of experience and expertise solving complex computer programming problems might not be as well-versed in the complexities of bias and discrimination. Social scientists, lawyers and others with experience and expertise on issues of bias and discrimination are likely to be useful throughout the AI development process.\n\n►The data used to train AI has to be examined critically for bias. If a chatbot learns how to tweet from the raw, unfiltered Twitter-verse, it will end up spewing racist tweets, as Microsoft found out. If an AI that aims to predict criminal behavior is fed racially biased arrest data, it will make racially biased predictions.\n\n►Once an AI is developed, its behavior must be evaluated carefully for bias. Many fairly obvious biases have gotten past developers, like gendered language, because they simply have not been looking for bias in their AI.\n\n►Finally, it is necessary that policymakers set up some sort of AI policing agency and establish sanctions for when companies negligently unleash harmful AI onto the public. The Algorithmic Accountability Act, introduced in the House of Representatives this year, is a step in the right direction.\n\nAI will continue to transform our lives. We need to consciously monitor it for racial bias, especially to make sure it is not a tool that will further racial inequality and division.\n\nAlgernon Austin is a senior researcher at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's Thurgood Marshall Institute.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/17"}]}
{"question_id": "20231013_13", "search_time": "2023/10/14/03:00", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-changes/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk now owns Twitter. Here's what he could change | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter spending months attempting to get out of his deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk officially owns the hugely influential platform. Now the question is: What will he actually do with it?\n\nMusk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.\n\nIn the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.\n\nDuring Tesla (TSLA)’s earnings call last week, Musk acknowledged that although finalizing the $44 billion deal meant “overpaying” for the social media firm, “the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” He added that he believes Twitter has “languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.”\n\nMusk’s plans for boosting Twitter’s value could involve cutting down its workforce, something he’s hinted at before. Previous reporting suggested that he’d planned to cut 75% of staff, although he is said to have told Twitter staff this week that’s not the case. Either way, anxieties are running high. Musk immediately fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde.\n\nIn private and public statements over the past six months, Musk has tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting this week that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nThere have been more far-fetched suggestions, too. In one text exchange with his brother Kimbal Musk, revealed last week in court documents, the two appeared to discuss the possibility of asking users to pay for each tweet they post with small amounts of the cryptocurrency DogeCoin.\n\nNow that Musk has completed the deal, some of those theoretical changes could soon become reality. Here’s what users should know:\n\nA big shift for content moderation\n\nFor years under former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter emphasized its work to bolster “healthy conversations.” The company banned many accounts promoting abuse and spam, added labels for false or misleading information, and banned the misgendering of transgender people.\n\nUnder Musk’s ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nMusk has said Twitter, under his leadership, would have more lenient content moderation policies. “If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in one on-stage interview in April. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nMusk on Thursday sought to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t plan to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape” despite his promises to reduce content moderation. The remarks follow questions about whether advertisers might leave the platform for fear of their paid posts ending up alongside potentially objectionable content.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in an open letter posted to Twitter. Allowing all legal speech may not be so straight forward — content rules vary across the world and, in Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards.\n\nMusk has also said he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm open source and make it more transparent to users when, for example, a tweet has been emphasized or demoted in their feed. (Leaders at Twitter have previously expressed support for moving in that direction, and the company often makes clear when it is demoting certain tweets or types of content.)\n\nUnbanning Trump and other accounts\n\nBut the most striking early change could come from who is and is not allowed on a Musk-owned Twitter.\n\nMusk has said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.” That could mean a long list of controversial far right figures and conspiracy theorists, among others, soon find their way back on the platform.\n\nMusk, for his part, has focused on bringing back one of Twitter’s most prominent former users: Trump.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said in May. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … But my opinion, and Jack Dorsey, I want to be clear, shares this opinion, is that we should not have perma-bans.”\n\nDorsey tweeted following Musk’s May remarks that he does “agree” there shouldn’t be permanent bans on Twitter users. “There are exceptions … but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to rejoin Twitter and will instead remain on his own social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nBut if Trump were to accept a Musk offer to return to Twitter, it could restore a significant following he hasn’t had since being banned from the platform in January 2021, just as the 2024 US Presidential race ramps up. On Truth Social, Trump has only 4 million followers; on Twitter, he reached an audience of more than 88 million followers.\n\nAn owner with an erratic and controversial history on the platform\n\nAnother notable change is simply who may be making these sensitive decisions.\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era. But he has also courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has more than 100 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform, and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and has compared the now-ousted Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk also previously sought to remove a Twitter account dedicated to tracking the movements of his private jet by offering to pay off the college freshman running the account (the account owner declined).\n\nThe same day he sent his letter to Twitter attempting to revive the deal, Musk was widely panned for comments he made on the platform about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He suggested making Crimea, a region Russia invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “formally part of Russia.” Most followers responded “no” to his poll and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk replied in a tweet: “F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you.” In a followup tweet, an apparently frustrated Musk seemed to blame the results of his poll on a “bot attack.”\n\nUntil now, Twitter has, at least to some extent, been accountable for its policy decisions to advertisers, shareholders and its board. But those guardrails won’t necessarily exist under Musk’s leadership.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/31/2020-election-michigan-again-target-disinformation-campaigns/6101943002/", "title": "2020 election: Michigan again a target of disinformation campaigns", "text": "DETROIT – Disinformation tactics used to mislead voters are continuing and evolving just days before the presidential election.\n\nWhat role disinformation may play on Election Day in Michigan isn’t yet clear, but, in the four years since the last presidential election, questions still linger about how social media changes what happens in the voting booth. Some strategies from 2016 seem to be continuing, including targeting minority groups with messages meant to discourage them from casting a ballot.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election in Michigan, proof of Russia’s deliberate attempt to mislead U.S. voters through a coordinated disinformation campaign on social media began to emerge. Michigan was one of nine states that two Russian agents visited in June 2014 as part of an intelligence-gathering mission, according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMisinformation and disinformation are terms used to describe false information, but misinformation is false information shared without the intent to cause harm. Disinformation is when someone deliberately creates or shares information that is incorrect to inflict damage, such as telling people the wrong date of the election.\n\nYoung Mie Kim studied Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and continues to monitor for Russian-linked accounts during the 2020 presidential election cycle. Kim is a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she is part of a research project called Project DATA, or Digital Ad Tracking and Analysis. The project focuses on the 2020 election and tracks digital political ads to learn how parties, organizations and candidates target and speak to potential voters.\n\nOne example her team captured was an Instagram account called \"Michigan_Black_Community.\" It posed as an African American group in Michigan focused on racial issues. The group included anti-Kamala Harris posts, and Kim's group captured it in September 2019, just before the primaries. Instagram removed the account in mid-October in a sweep to rid the platform of false accounts created by Russian actors.\n\nHowever, despite teams such as Kim's trying to archive accounts and track the actions of foreign and domestic disinformation campaigns, it is difficult to get a clear picture of what is happening in the 2020 election, said Josh Tucker, a New York University professor of politics and co-director of NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics. That type of data isn’t being released in real time, Tucker said.\n\nIn the case of Facebook, data about what users saw in 2016 was never released, according to multiple sources the Free Press talked to.\n\nThere is more archived data about how human beings interact with politics than ever in the history of scholarship because of all this digital tracing, Tucker said. But it isn’t public.\n\n“All this data that we need to try to understand how the political world is being transformed by social media is actually owned by the companies whose impact we’re trying to understand,” Tucker said. “And they have a say on who gets access to this and how you get access to this.”\n\nTestimony before Congress from these tech company executives has given the public some insight into how their news feeds are formed.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing on Oct. 28, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg what his company was doing to prevent extremist groups from growing on the platform.\n\n“We’ve taken a number of steps here including disqualifying groups from being included in our recommendation system at all if they routinely are being used to share misinformation or if they have content violations or a number of other criteria,” Zuckerberg said.\n\nMichigan on Russia’s radar\n\nIn Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, told a Russian intelligence officer about his plans to win the election, including naming four key “battleground” states, according to testimony from Rick Gates, Manafort’s former business partner.\n\nThat list included Michigan, as well as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Minnesota. Detroit was mentioned once on page 34 of the report, from a Nov. 7, 2016, tweet when a troll referred to the city, tweeting: \"Detroit residents speak out against the failed policies of Obama, Hillary & democrats.\"\n\nFacebook told the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2017 that in the two years leading up to the 2016 election, ads bought by the Kremlin-linked Russian operative, the Internet Research Agency, reached as many as 126 million users. In January 2018, Twitter announced approximately 1.4 million users had some type of interaction with an IRA-controlled account.\n\nThis doesn't tell the whole story, though, said Kim, the professor who found the \"Michigan_black_community\" Instagram account. Once an IRA ad was shared by another user, Facebook considered that share to be \"organic.\" Facebook did not release data about where the IRA content went after it stopped being a paid advertisement and became something shared by other Facebook users.\n\nWhen U.S. intelligence officials warned the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was again ramping up efforts to poke around in the 2020 election, Kim wrote a piece for the Brennen Center for Justice about how much more brazen Russia accounts became after 2016.\n\nIn addition to emphasizing wedge issues, such as race and gun control, Kim found the accounts run by the IRA appeared to be targeting battleground states, including Michigan, by putting the state directly into the account's user name.\n\nThese accounts also no longer appear to be buying ads; rather, they're now sharing domestic content. This blurs the line between foreign and domestic actors enough to sometimes evade the safety protocols Facebook and other platforms put into place.\n\nLast week, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced Iran was behind emails sent to people in Pennsylvania and Ohio threatening they would be attacked if they went to the polls. The people behind the intimidation attack used a domain that made it appear the emails came from the far-right authoritarian group Proud Boys. No officials have announced any Michigan voters getting similar emails.\n\nA new election playbook\n\nIt isn’t just foreign actors who are trying to confuse or mislead voters. Earlier this month, Jacob Wohl, a 22-year-old Los Angeles resident, and Jack Burkman, a 54-year-old resident of Arlington, Virginia, were charged with several felonies related to voter intimidation and election fraud. The pair, who pleaded not guilty, are accused of orchestrating a series of inaccurate robocalls to Michigan voters, telling them that law enforcement and debt collectors would use the information provided by those who cast an absentee ballot.\n\nPartisan news sites have also sprung up, all with innocuous names that an unwitting reader could mistake for just a normal local newspaper. There are at least 34 of these sites with names linked to Michigan areas.\n\nSites not always mentioned when talking about social media have also come under scrutiny, such as Spotify, which on Oct. 19 removed four QAnon conspiracy podcasts after Media Matters for America noted the group was being left to thrive on its platform, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe legacy of the 2016 Russian interference in U.S. elections is not that Russia created a blueprint for foreign interference, Tucker said. Rather it is a toolkit for anyone to do these coordinated campaigns online.\n\n“Who's got the biggest stake in the outcome of elections?” Tucker asked. “It's the domestic actors in those countries.\"\n\nPlatforms on guard\n\nAfter 2016, it seemed like the platforms were caught unaware both of the rapid rise of political disinformation and the foreign influence campaigns, Tucker said.\n\nThey’ve had four years to prepare for this and have made some changes, Tucker said, including monitoring for fake accounts and deplatforming (removing) pages that spread false information. Both Twitter and Facebook have added voting information links to content related to the U.S. elections. Facebook restricted new political or social justice advertising starting Oct. 27.\n\nAd campaigns submitted before the deadline continue to run, but changes to the content of those ads is limited and new campaigns are not allowed until after the election. The platform expects to host no political advertising for a week beginning on Nov. 4.\n\nTwitter added a new prompt that pops up when users try to retweet a link they haven't recently opened. The prompt tells the user, \"Headlines don't tell the full story,\" and gives them the option to read the story on Twitter before retweeting. The new feature was meant to \"give you better context and to reduce the unintentional spread of misleading information on Twitter.\"\n\n“Now, in the aftermath of these elections, will we see if they were more effective, I don’t know,” Tucker said. “And I don’t know about both of those things. I don’t know how much we’ll be able to see at the end of the day, and I’m also not sure what we’ll learn.”\n\nFacebook also announced in August it would partner with independent researchers to study whether the platform changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Dartmouth government professor Brendan Nyhan is one of the researchers who will participate in that effort.\n\nWhen Nyhan, who previously taught at the University of Michigan, studied how people's beliefs changed after exposure to misleading and false information, he found articles didn't change people's minds, but did appear to increase partisanship. More studies need to be done, he said, but he said he believes people should be more thoughtful about how they talk about disinformation.\n\n\"It doesn't mean this stuff doesn't matter, but we need to be more specific in thinking about how it might matter and for whom,\" Nyhan said.\n\nFadi Quran is the disinformation lead for Avaaz, an online activist organization group with more than 65 million members worldwide that focuses on issues such as climate change and disinformation. Social media platforms are the ones that can tell who has interacted with disinformation and how their behavior changed, and they don't do that, Quran said. He was skeptical the research being done by Nyhan and others would yield the type of transparency needed to answer questions about the effects of disinformation.\n\n\"In many cases, Facebook promises, gets all the positive PR and then pulls back,\" Quran said. \"We saw that with NYU recently.\"\n\nQuran was referring to Facebook demanding an end to the collection of data by New York University researchers whose tool, AdObserver, shows who is being micro-targeted by political ads on the platform. Users install the AdObserver browser extension and allow it to capture the ads they are served on Facebook.\n\nThe AdObservatory is part of NYU's Online Political Transparency Project. In a Medium post about the features of the AdObserver tool, NYU explained how political campaigns can upload to Facebook a spreadsheet of people’s names, phone numbers or email addresses to target them with advertising.\n\nFor instance, the AdObservatory shows that in Michigan, Sen. Peters uploaded an email list from Anne Lewis Consulting LLC, a media strategy firm used by Political Action Committees such as the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education Treasury Fund. Peters also targeted people in Ann Arbor and Marysville.\n\nPeters' opponent, Republican businessman John James, uploaded his own list to Facebook. He also targeted people with homes in Michigan and who liked Ben Shapiro, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and/or Tucker Carlson.\n\nIn total, Peters and his associated pages so far have spent about $1.4 million on Facebook advertising, compared with James, who has spent about $165,000, according to AdObserver's data.\n\nIn 2016, foreign actors had access to the same tools Peters and James use now.\n\nQuran pointed to the billions spent on Facebook advertisements as part of why he doubts the idea the platform doesn't have the power to change elections.\n\n\"The truth is if you're a marketer and you've used Facebook to sell your products, you do know how much influence the platform can have in terms of its reach on people,\" Quran said.\n\nThe truth is, even if disinformation campaigns are 5% effective or 3% effective, that could sway a swing state, Quran said.\n\n[ Please take our new survey: How concerned are you about disinformation? ]\n\nCountry divides\n\nAs acting assistant secretary of defense from 2015 to 2017, U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, said she saw what an effective tool disinformation can be in dividing countries. She watched Russia use disinformation campaigns in former Soviet states in Eastern Europe.\n\nRussia’s strategy was to turn people within a country against one another, Slotkin said. Part of the reason disinformation is so effective is that it capitalizes on real issues, such as what to do about a global pandemic and how to address racial divides, she said.\n\n“What they’re doing is taking those differences and amplifying them and making people feel like they have to take sides,” Slotkin said.\n\nWhile speaking to a group of about 40 Michigan voters recently, Slotkin asked how many had lost a friend or family member over politics this year. Almost everyone in the group raised their hand, she said. People can’t stand the tension and they just want this election to be done, she said.\n\nA limited, but dangerous threat\n\nWhile disinformation undermines some of the fundamental tenets of democracy, such as informed voting, Tucker did emphasize what a small percentage of overall media Russian trolls took up in 2016.\n\n“We always want to be careful about overstating the influence of a small number of tweets during the course of the election,” Tucker said.\n\nIt might have affected some individuals in 2016, but the idea that it affected a large number of people seems highly doubtful, Tucker said. Overstating how much false information was circulating in 2016 can lead people to feel helpless, when researchers know the problem wasn’t so large that disinformation drowned out legitimate news in 2016, he said.\n\nThree of Facebook's own security researchers wrote a report in April 2017 about information operations on the platform and said, \"The reach of the content shared by false amplifiers was marginal compared to the overall volume of civic content shared during the US election.\"\n\nWhen looking at all the content created during the run up to 2016, Kim said the idea that other content drowned out the disinformation campaigns makes sense. However, the strategy appeared to focus on minority groups in certain states — meaning they might have been inundated with disinformation.\n\nTo report misinformation\n\nIn anticipation of another year of deceptive advertising in Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson created an email address where voters can report misinformation to the Secretary of State's Office. Depending on the reach and content of the information, it can be corrected on the Secretary of State's fact check page or escalated to the Attorney General's office. Attempts to misinform the public in 2016 included claims that mailing in a ballot wouldn’t count, that certain polling places would be closed and that there were long lines to vote, Benson said.\n\n“A lot of the nefarious things would say, ‘Election Day’s been moved,’” Benson said.\n\nMinority groups in swing states are often the primary targets of this sort of messaging, Kim said. Those voters, especially, should be wary as Election Day approaches, she said.\n\nAshley Nerbovig covers mis- and disinformation for the Detroit Free Press. Contact her at anerbovig@freepress.com.

The ads were targeted to battleground states such as Arizona and Georgia. While YouTube was able to detect and reject every test submission and suspend the channel used to post them, the other two platforms fared noticeably worse, according to the report.\n\nTikTok approved 90% of ads that contained blatantly false or misleading information, the researchers found. Facebook, meanwhile, approved a “significant number,” according to the report, though noticeably less than TikTok.\n\nThe ads, submitted in both English and Spanish, included information falsely stating that voting days would be extended and that social media accounts could double as a means of voter verification. The ads also contained claims designed to discourage voter turnout, such as claims that the election results could be hacked or the outcome was pre-decided.\n\nThe researchers withdrew the ads after going through the approval process, if they were approved, so the ads containing misinformation were not shown to users.\n\n“YouTube’s performance in our experiment demonstrates that detecting damaging election disinformation isn’t impossible,” Laura Edelson, co-director of NYU’s C4D team, said in a statement with the report. “But all the platforms we studied should have gotten an ‘A’ on this assignment. We call on Facebook and TikTok to do better: stop bad information about elections before it gets to voters.”\n\nIn response to the report, a spokesperson for Facebook-parent Meta said the tests “were based on a very small sample of ads, and are not representative given the number of political ads we review daily across the world.” The spokesperson added: “Our ads review process has several layers of analysis and detection, both before and after an ad goes live.”\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the platform “is a place for authentic and entertaining content which is why we prohibit and remove election misinformation and paid political advertising from our platform. We value feedback from NGOs, academics, and other experts which helps us continually strengthen our processes and policies.”\n\nGoogle said it has “developed extensive measures to tackle misinformation on our platforms, including false claims about elections and voting procedures.” The company added: “We know how important it is to protect our users from this type of abuse – particularly ahead of major elections like those in the United States and Brazil – and we continue to invest in and improve our enforcement systems to better detect and remove this content.”\n\nWhile limited in scope, the experiment could renew concerns about the steps taken by some of the biggest social platforms to combat not just misinformation about candidates and issues but also seemingly clear cut misinformation about the process of voting itself, with just weeks to go before the midterms.\n\nTikTok, whose influence and scrutiny in US politics has grown in recent election cycles, launched an Elections Center in August to “connect people who engage with election content to authoritative information,” including guidance on where and how to vote, and added labels to clearly identify content related to the midterm elections, according to a company blog post.\n\nLast month, TikTok took additional steps to safeguard the veracity of political content ahead of the midterms. The platform began to require “mandatory verification” for political accounts based in the United States and rolled out a blanket ban on all political fundraising.\n\n“As we have set out before, we want to continue to develop policies that foster and promote a positive environment that brings people together, not divide them,” Blake Chandlee, President of Global Business Solutions at TikTok, said in a blog post at the time. “We do that currently by working to keep harmful misinformation off the platform, prohibiting political advertising, and connecting our community with authoritative information about elections.”\n\nMeta said in September that its midterm plan would include removing false claims as to who can vote and how, as well as calls for violence linked to an election. But Meta stopped short of banning claims of rigged or fraudulent elections, and the company told The Washington Post those types of claims will not be removed for any content involving the 2020 election. Looking forward, Meta has banned US ads that “call into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election,” including the midterms, according to company policy.\n\nGoogle also took steps in September to protect against election misinformation, elevating trustworthy information and displaying it more prominently across services including search and YouTube.\n\nThe big social media companies typically rely on a mix of artificial intelligence systems and human moderators to vet the vast amount of posts on their platforms. But even with similar approaches and objectives, the study is a reminder that the platforms can differ wildly in their content enforcement actions.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the only ad they submitted that TikTok rejected contained claims that voters had to have received a Covid-19 vaccination in order to vote.

It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission,” he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy Brian Fung Zach Wasser Logan Whiteside", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing.

Companies that abide by the voluntary agreement may be less likely to be accused of violating the law, or potentially given more benefit of the doubt, according to the European Commission.\n\nIn a statement, European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová cited Russian disinformation as a major driver for the new code.\n\n“This new anti-disinformation Code comes at a time when Russia is weaponising disinformation as part of its military aggression against Ukraine, but also when we see attacks on democracy more broadly,” she said. “We now have very significant commitments to reduce the impact of disinformation online and much more robust tools to measure how these are implemented across the EU in all countries and in all its languages.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/politics/fact-check-trump-claims-fbi-search/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Trump's false and uncorroborated claims in response to ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his representatives have offered up a dizzying flurry of defenses in the wake of the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago resort and residence in early August – and some of their claims are false, uncorroborated or sharply disputed.\n\nHere is a look at the facts, as we know them today, around five of the public arguments Trump and his team have made in the wake of the search.\n\nThe claim: Trump declassified everything\n\nThe Justice Department said in a court filing this week that the search of Mar-a-Lago resulted in the seizure of more than 100 unique documents with classification markings. But in posts on his social media platform, Trump has argued that he had declassified all of the documents in his possession.\n\n“Number one, it was all declassified,” he wrote in a post on August 12. “Lucky I Declassified!” he wrote in a post this Wednesday.\n\nTrump’s comments about this supposed declassification have been very vague. But conservative writer John Solomon, one of the people Trump named as a representative in his dealings with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), was more specific in a Fox appearance on August 12. Solomon read a statement, which he said was from Trump’s office, claiming that Trump “had a standing order…that documents removed from the Oval Office and taken to the residence were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them.”\n\nFacts First: Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so. Eighteen former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN in August that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nIt’s important to note that the laws under which the Justice Department is now investigating possible crimes – statutes about the willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of a federal investigation, and the concealment or removal of government records – do not require documents to be classified for a crime to have been committed. (A grand jury subpoena in May and the search warrant in August both sought documents with “classification markings,” not specifically documents that are currently classified.) Also, there would be major questions about the legal validity of any broad “standing order” to automatically declassify any document Trump carried out of a certain room.\n\nBut first things first: Trump has shown no corroboration for the claim that he did issue such an order.\n\nThe Justice Department said in the court filing this week that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified either when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings in January (after an extended back-and-forth with NARA) or when responding to the grand jury subpoena in June, when they returned another package of documents that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\n– CNN’s Jamie Gangel, Elizabeth Stuart and Jeremy Herb contributed to this item.\n\nThe claim: The feds could’ve just asked for the documents\n\nTrump has argued that the search was unnecessary because the federal investigators could have simply asked for the documents from his team, which he claimed had been fully cooperative.\n\n“They could have had it anytime they wanted—and that includes LONG ago. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK,” Trump posted on his social media platform on August 12.\n\nFacts First: It is not true that federal investigators could have long ago obtained the government records in Trump’s possession just by asking. By the time of the search, the federal government had been asking Trump for more than a year to return records from his presidency. Even when the Justice Department went beyond asking in May and served Trump’s team with the subpoena for the return of all documents with classification markings, Trump’s team returned only some of these documents – and then, in June, Trump lawyer Christina Bobb signed a document certifying on behalf of Trump’s office that all of the documents had been returned, though that was not true.\n\nIn other words: Trump claimed that the Justice Department could have just asked for the documents “LONG ago” even though his team explicitly and inaccurately told the department in June that there were no documents left to ask for. Relatedly, the department has called into question how cooperative Trump’s team was.\n\nIn its court filing this week, the department asserted that investigators “developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room” at Mar-a-Lago “and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation.” They said of the August search: “That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the ‘diligent search’ that the former President’s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter.”\n\nThe claim: It was the bureaucrats’ fault\n\nA member of Trump’s team has tried to pin blame on the General Services Administration, a federal agency that provides transition office space and assistance services to the outgoing president.\n\nKash Patel, a former Trump administration official whom Trump named as another representative to NARA, said on Fox on August 12 on that “the GSA has since come out, the Government (sic) Services Administration, and said they mistakenly packed some boxes and moved them to Mar-a-Lago. That’s not on the President. That’s on the National Archives to sort that material out.” Patel said that even if material was classified, which is “highly unlikely,” the fact that the GSA boxed the material “should have been the end” of the matter.\n\nFacts First: The GSA has repeatedly rejected Patel’s claim. The agency says it had no role in deciding which documents from Trump’s outgoing transition office in Virginia would be placed in boxes or which boxes would be shipped to Mar-a-Lago – and that these decisions were made by Trump’s team alone.\n\nA GSA spokesperson said in a statement last week that it was Trump’s team, not the GSA, that packed the boxes and that it was Trump’s team, not the GSA, that put these boxes on pallets and shrink-wrapped them for shipping from Trump’s transition office in Virginia. GSA did enter into a support contract for the actual September 2021 shipping, but “not for the packing of the boxes,” the spokesperson said – and “GSA did not examine the contents of the boxes and, accordingly, had no knowledge of the contents prior to shipping.”\n\nIt is not clear how many of the government documents recovered at Mar-a-Lago were part of the September 2021 shipments from Virginia. It is theoretically possible that some documents were taken to Mar-a-Lago at other times and in other ways.\n\n- CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this item.\n\nThe claim: The FBI may have planted evidence\n\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba said on Fox on August 9: “I’m concerned that they may have planted something; you know, at this point, who knows?” The next day, Trump suggested on social media that it was shady that the FBI would not allow witnesses, such as his lawyers, to be in the rooms being searched and “see what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, ‘planting.’”\n\nFacts First: There is zero evidence that the FBI planted anything at Mar-a-Lago. And it is routine, not suspicious, for searches to be conducted without witnesses such as lawyers being in the room; lawyers don’t have a right to watch.\n\nThe claim about possible “planting” is impossible to definitively debunk at this point. Once more, though, Trump and his allies have not shown even a hint of proof that it is true.\n\nThe claim: Obama took tens of millions of documents\n\nThe week of the search, Trump turned to a familiar tactic under pressure: confuse the public by making false claims about former President Barack Obama. Trump asserted that Obama had taken tens of millions of documents to Chicago, Obama’s adopted hometown and the location of his future library and museum.\n\nIn a social media post on August 11, Trump wrote, “What happened to the 30 million pages of documents taken from the White House to Chicago by Barack Hussein Obama? He refused to give them back! What is going on? This act was strongly at odds with NARA. Will they be breaking into Obama’s ‘mansion’ in Martha’s Vineyard?” In another statement on August 12, Trump claimed: “President Barack Hussein Obama kept 33 million pages of documents, much of them classified.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims about Obama are comprehensively untrue – and the National Archives and Records Administration issued an official statement making that clear. The statement explained that all of Obama’s presidential records remain in NARA’s “exclusive legal and physical custody”; that it was NARA, not Obama, that took about 30 million records to a NARA facility in the Chicago area; that the records it took to the Chicago-area facility are unclassified; and that classified Obama records are at a different NARA facility.\n\nNARA has more information here about the plan for Obama’s presidential records.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/china/china-russia-disinformation-campaign-ukraine-intl-dst-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's promotion of Russian disinformation indicates where its ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nIn public statements and at international summits, Chinese officials have attempted to stake out a seemingly neutral position on the war in Ukraine, neither condemning Russian actions nor ruling out the possibility Beijing could act as a mediator in a push for peace.\n\nBut while its international messaging has kept many guessing as to Beijing’s true intentions, much of its domestic media coverage of Russia’s invasion tells a wholly different story.\n\nThere, an alternate reality is playing out for China’s 1.4 billion people, one in which the invasion is nothing more than a “special military operation,” according to its national broadcaster CCTV; the United States may be funding a biological weapons program in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is a victim standing up for a beleaguered Russia.\n\nTo tell that story, major state-run news media outlets – which dominate China’s highly censored media space – have been largely echoing Russian state media stories or information from Russian officials.\n\nA CNN analysis reviewed nearly 5,000 social media posts from 14 Chinese state media outlets during the first eight days of Russia’s invasion posted onto China’s Twitter-like platform, Weibo. The analysis found that of the more than 300 most-shared posts about the events in Ukraine – which were each shared more than 1,000 times – almost half, about 140, were what CNN classified as distinctly pro-Russian, often containing information attributed to a Russian official or picked up directly from Russia’s state media.\n\nThe analysis, which focused on stories that got the most play on social media, may not be representative of all posts shared by state media outlets on Weibo. But it provides a snapshot of the state media-produced information that is most visible to the more than half a billion monthly users on the popular platform.\n\nIt’s not clear the extent to which these posts may be explicitly the result of a coordinated propaganda campaign between the two countries, but it is consistent with an ongoing pattern in which Russian and Chinese media have amplified and reinforced their often-interchangeable talking points on issues such as the treatment of Russian dissidents, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, or the supposed American role in fomenting “color revolutions” against authoritarian regimes.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping walk down the stairs as they arrive for a BRICS summit in Brasilia, Brazil in 2019. Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nSuch mutual reinforcement has also spilled over into the extensive overseas and English-language propaganda operations that both countries have built to promote their views globally – a route made more important with Russia’s state media outlets being banned on air and online in parts of the West.\n\nIn China’s top-down government-controlled media environment, all state-affiliated content is vetted and issued in accordance with government directives. That China has chosen to follow Russia’s lead in deliberately mischaracterizing the war only serves to underline Beijing’s closeness to Moscow – and almost makes a mockery of China’s self-proclaimed impartiality in helping to engage with Russia and bring an end to the violence.\n\nThe playbook\n\nRussian assurances that civilian sites will not be targeted – despite extensive evidence to the contrary, descriptions of Ukrainian soldiers using “Nazi” tactics, and misinformation regarding the whereabouts of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are all stories that have been funneled from Russian sources into China’s enclosed social media ecosystem – where many Western news outlets are blocked – by its state media outlets in recent days.\n\nThat dynamic was at play on Monday morning, when China’s state broadcaster CCTV released a package in its morning newscast highlighting Moscow’s erroneous claim that Washington had funded the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian labs. That insinuation is used to support the narrative that Ukraine – characterized by Moscow as an American puppet state – threatens Russia, and not the other way around.\n\nThe source? Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov, who on Sunday said Russian forces uncovered “evidence” of the “hasty measures to conceal any traces of the military biological program finance(d) by the US Department of Defense,” and referenced documents he said detailed the destruction of hazardous pathogens at these facilities on the order of the Ukrainian Health Ministry.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on “Russia’s false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine” and noted the “echoing” of those “conspiracy theories” by Chinese officials.\n\n“This is preposterous. It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,” Psaki said, adding that the US was “in full compliance” with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and “does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.”\n\n“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern,” Psaki said.\n\nThe subject was also raised in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, when Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland, asked if Ukraine had biological weapons, said it has biological research facilities, which the US was concerned Russian forces may be seeking to control.\n\n“We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces, should they approach,” Nuland said.\n\nResidents watch a TV screen showing news about Ukraine at a shopping mall in Hangzhou, in China's eastern Zhejiang province on February 25, 2022. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMinutes after the CCTV report aired, an affiliated news outlet released an online post repeating the claims from Russia’s Defense Ministry and started a related hashtag on Weibo, which began trending. The hashtag was viewed more than 45 million times over a period of hours that day.\n\nThe next day, after Russia doubled down on the biological weapons claims with further statements, without evidence, CCTV released a new television segment, which was again shared by prominent state media outlets on Weibo, gaining further traction.\n\nThe story then moved into the narrative of China’s officials when a state media reporter at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing asked a question about the laboratories, prompting the spokesperson to read a lengthy prepared response that repeated Russian disinformation.\n\n“We once again urge the US to fully clarify its biological militarization activities both inside and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.\n\nWithin hours, at least 17 state media outlets, including CCTV, Xinhua, and the People’s Daily, posted Zhao’s response on Weibo, where the topic racked up more than 210 million views. A related hashtag rose to be the top trending topic on Weibo by the following afternoon.\n\nThe pattern is just one example of a playbook that enables China to cover the war through the lens of Russian rhetoric and disinformation. Other examples include stories, such as repeated false claims that Zelensky fled the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv – sourced to a single Russian lawmaker, which were picked up and amplified by both Chinese and Russian state media outlets on their domestic and international platforms.\n\nA CNN analysis sought to understand how large a role such stories play in China’s tightly controlled media ecosystem, first by combing through nearly 5,000 social media posts from the Weibo accounts of 14 of China’s most influential state media outlets, focusing on the first eight days of the invasion and news about the events in Ukraine.\n\nNext, CNN analyzed which of those posts were the most highly engaged with, identifying more than 300 posts shared on Weibo more than 1,000 times. Of those more than 300 posts, an analysis found that nearly half showed Russia in a positive light – a category CNN defined as news sourced solely from Russian officials or Russian media, content that describes Ukraine negatively, misinformation about Zelensky, or pro-Putin coverage.\n\nWhile about 140 posts showed Russia in a positive light, the analysis identified fewer than 15 posts that portrayed Ukraine positively.\n\nA look at other characterizations showed only around 90 of these posts were neutral – for example, purely factual reports from reliable sources, news about humanitarian aid or updates on the evacuation of Chinese citizens from Ukraine.\n\nJust over a third were what CNN classified as anti-West or anti-US, for example: stories airing views that Russia was pushed to action in Ukraine by the expansion of NATO, or criticizing Western media coverage of the crisis.\n\nCNN reporters classified some posts into more than one category. A look at the distribution shows posts that depicted Russia in a positive light were more frequent than any other category.\n\nBecause CNN only studied posts with high engagement, the findings may not be representative of all posts produced by state media.\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday the country is a victim of disinformation.\n\n“Some anti-China forces and media have fabricated too many lies, rumors and disinformation about China on issues that include the situation in Ukraine,” it said in a statement. “They have smeared the image of China, poisoned the media environment and misled public worldwide. Such actions are hypocritical and despicable.”\n\nThe backdrop\n\nThe findings contrast the apparent middle line that China has tried to walk in its international diplomacy.\n\nThough Beijing has stood apart from the Western response to Russia’s invasion, with its diplomats refusing to condemn the invasion, or even call it such, and decrying Western sanctions, it has also frequently repeated that “all countries’ legitimate security concerns” should be addressed.\n\nIn a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for negotiations to bring about “peaceful outcomes” and stressed China’s promises to contribute humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\n“There is a difference between the way China talks to the international audience and the way it talks to the domestic audience … for the domestic audience, it’s important to preserve this partnership with Russia, because that’s a political priority for Xi,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow and the chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\nHe points to the increasingly close relationship between China and Russia in recent years, a strategic partnership strengthened, in part, by shared friction with the West.\n\n“So (China’s leaders) need to shape public perceptions about this, and explain why dealing with Russia is morally justified or is the right thing to do – and (China’s media coverage) serves this purpose,” he said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a daily media briefing in Beijing, China, March 19, 2021. Roman Pilipey/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nA glimpse into how China may seek to control its coverage was given in the days prior to the invasion, when an internal directive that was apparently accidentally shared on social media showed Chinese state media outlet Beijing News ordered its employees not to publish news reports that were “negative about Russia or pro-West.” Beijing News did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMaria Repnikova, director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University, said Russia-leaning coverage was in line with historical precedent: “Stories that are critical of Russia or are portraying Russia in an unfavorable manner are generally censored,” she said.\n\n“As a result of that, it is expedient to use Russian state media sources because they’re the ones portraying the (Ukraine) conflict with a more favorable eye or view from the Russian perspective,” she said.\n\nAnother sign of this has been which voices have been allowed to thrive on China’s heavily censored social media platforms in the wake of the invasion. There, pro-Russia and anti-Western, nationalistic voices have also dominated, while there has been a suppression of pro-Ukrainian or anti-war messages on platforms and across the media landscape.\n\nOne glaring example came Friday, when CCTV broadcast a speech from International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons, at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Paralympic Games, in which many parts of the speech were muffled and were not translated.\n\nThe offending context? Parsons’ “message of peace,” in which he did not name Russia or Ukraine but said he was “horrified at what is taking place in the world.”\n\nThose voices from within China who have tried to speak up – including five history professors who penned an open letter voicing their strong opposition to “Russia’s war against Ukraine” – have seen their posts swiftly deleted or social accounts suspended.\n\n“We have seen alternative, critical voices – some subtle critique or attempts to present scenes from the war zone and talk about humanity and empathy toward Ukraine – (but) a lot of these messages have been censored,” said Repnikova.\n\nSocial media platforms in China have taken action against extremist nationalist voices in recent weeks, with Sina Weibo “punishing” around 75 accounts and screening out more than 1,500 posts and video-streaming platform Douyin removing over 6,000 illegal videos, according to the state-owned Global Times. But the nationalistic voices that have dominated social media platforms fall in line with what Repnikova describes as “a significant spike in digital nationalism, (with) the US and the West (as) the key target of this nationalistic sentiment.”\n\nBreak the monopoly\n\nThat nationalist sentiment – fueled by a deep distrust of the US and concern about its role as the leading global power – are a critical part of the glue that has firmed up the Russian and Chinese relationship in recent years.\n\nIt’s also filtered in the kinds of media coverage that each have shared overseas, as both Russia and China have sought to deepen their propaganda efforts, launching social media-friendly news brands in English and other languages, like China’s CGTN and RT (formerly Russia Today).\n\nWhile experts say it’s unclear if top media officials from the two countries are discussing news coverage at an operational level and some official coordination is more symbolic in nature, there is a growing push in recent years for alignment and content-sharing.\n\nA large Ukrainian flag with the slogan \"We Stand With Ukraine\" written on it in Chinese characters is seen on the outside wall of the Canadian Embassy on March 1, 2022 in Beijing, China. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nA number of content-sharing arrangements exist between Chinese and Russian media outlets, and the shared vision is clear: these outlets together can “break the monopoly of Western media,” as a Global Times report on a China-Russia media forum in 2015 put it.\n\nFast-forward to the crisis in Ukraine and the upside of that collaboration, for one partner anyway, is clear.\n\nIn the European Union, Kremlin-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik were officially banned as of last Wednesday, with companies like Meta, parent of Facebook and Instagram, and Google’s YouTube stepping in to block their content.\n\nBut, on China’s channels like CGTN and Global Times, which continue to operate, those Russian talking points are still getting through.\n\nAlready this week, posts from those accounts have suggested Ukraine and the US have pro-Nazi leanings, repeated Russian misinformation on the laboratories, and cited Russia denying that it plans to overthrow the existing government in its “special military operation” in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}]}

Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago.

Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nMore on Williamson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nRepublican party candidates for 2024\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 55\n\nFamily: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.\n\nPrevious political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group.

He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.\n\nBurgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.\n\nHis views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.\n\nMore on Burgum's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 60\n\nFamily: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986.

Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.\n\nWhile in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once.

That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to \"contain China\" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.\n\nMore on Elder's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nFamily: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.\n\nShe and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.\n\nPrevious political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has \"never lost a race.\"\n\nIn 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia.

In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.\n\nHis views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China,\" − and \"if you don't like it, well, tough.\" His campaign's signature \"2 cents\" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.\n\nMore on Johnson's 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nLatest Perry Johnson news: Explore\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore on Pence's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015.

He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump.

The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics.

The following day, he was across the country in New Hampshire, with plans to visit South Carolina before the end of his first week.\n\nBut seven years later – and nearly three weeks into his 2024 presidential campaign – Trump has yet to leave his home state or hold a public campaign event in an early voting state.\n\nTrump’s disengaged posture has baffled former and current allies, many of whom experienced firsthand the frenetic pace of his two previous White House bids, and who now say he’s missed the window to make a splash with his 2024 rollout. The uninspiring launch of his supposed political comeback comes as his campaign appears to be operating on auto pilot, with few signs of momentum or enthusiastic support from donors or party heavyweights.\n\n“I don’t know why he rushed this. It doesn’t make sense,” one Trump adviser said of his lackluster announcement speech last month, which came one week after Republicans delivered an underwhelming performance in the midterm elections and as the rest of the party turned its attention to the Senate runoff contest in Georgia.\n\nTrump’s announcement was roundly panned for lacking zest, so much so that some audience members attempted an early exit, and his recent hosting of Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and embattled rapper Kanye “Ye” West at Mar-a-Lago only further galvanized GOP opposition against him. A person familiar with the matter said Trump spent the Sunday after Thanksgiving asking people around him if they thought the backlash to his private dinner with Ye and Fuentes was truly damaging.\n\n“So far, he has gone down from his bedroom, made an announcement, gone back up to his bedroom and hasn’t been seen since except to have dinner with a White supremacist,” said a 2020 Trump campaign adviser.\n\n“It’s 1000% a ho-hum campaign,” the adviser added.\n\nThe only other notable event to occur since Trump announced he was running again was both unintended and dreaded for weeks by the former president’s attorneys. Just three days after Trump launched his campaign, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee two ongoing criminal investigations into the 45th president and his associates.\n\nWhile some Republicans long speculated that Trump entered the presidential race early to inoculate himself from further legal peril, his candidate status instead appeared to serve as the catalyst for Garland’s announcement.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesman said the former president has held “multiple events since he announced,” noting his remote appearance at the annual Republican Jewish Coalition summit last month, video remarks to a conference for conservative activists in Mexico, a Patriots Freedom Fund event, his remarks at two separate political events held at Mar-a-Lago, and a tele-rally Monday night for Georgia Republican Senate hopeful Herschel Walker. None of these events were billed as campaign events.\n\nTrump’s current campaign trajectory has left both allies and Republican opponents wondering if he will flip a switch in 2023 or fail to adapt to a different political environment. Even as the GOP’s undisputed 2024 frontrunner, some of his closest allies say he simply cannot afford to take his position for granted at a moment when influential Republicans appear exceedingly interested in dislodging him from his influential perch.\n\n“If Trump was working in a lush jungle environment in 2016, he is in a desert today,” said a Republican close to the former president. “The political landscape has totally changed. He was irresistible because no one understood him but now everybody knows how to deal with him, so the question is, can he recalibrate?”\n\nSome sources said Trump’s first-out-of-the-gate strategy, which was said to be partly aimed at clearing the GOP primary field, already looks poised to fail.\n\n“You know what it’s done to dissuade people from getting in? Nothing. He hasn’t hired anyone. He hasn’t been to the early states,” said the 2020 campaign adviser.\n\nTrump’s lack of impact was on display a week after his announcement, as other 2024 Republican hopefuls took the stage in Las Vegas for the annual RJC summit. Some attacked the former President, while others, once allies of Trump, indicated they were ready to take him on in 2024.\n\nJust days before the event, Trump’s team announced plans for him to address the group remotely. Two people familiar with the matter said his virtual address was organized by aides at the last minute after he grew agitated upon realizing the event was a cattle call for Republican presidential prospects and he was not on its original list of speakers. The Trump campaign spokesman disputed this account, saying Trump’s remote remarks were planned “many weeks prior to the event.”\n\nOther sources who for months harbored concerns that Trump wasn’t as enthusiastic about running as he was letting on in public appearances now say his inactivity has increased their worry. Apart from a planned fundraising appearance for a classical education group in Naples last weekend, the former president has yet to announce any events before the end of the year. A person familiar with the matter said Trump’s team is toying with a pre-Christmas event of some kind, though his campaign has not yet finalized any travel. In a statement last week panning a move by Democratic officials to put South Carolina first on the party’s primary calendar, Trump appeared to tease a visit to Iowa, currently the first state to cast votes in both parties’ presidential nominating contests, “in the very near future.”\n\n“I can’t wait to be back in Iowa,” he said.\n\nCampaign is ‘taking a breather’\n\nInside Trump’s campaign, sources said his current approach is entirely intentional, dismissing concerns that he has forfeited the spotlight at a critical time but acknowledging that Trump is currently working with a bare-bones staff.\n\nThe campaign “is doing exactly what everyone always accuses [them] of not doing – taking a breather, planning and forming a strategy for the next two years,” said one source familiar with Trump’s operation said.\n\nSenior staff are holed up working on a plan,” this person added, noting that Trump’s campaign travel is expected to begin early in the new year, right as possible rivals who have taken the holidays to mull their own political futures may start launching their own campaigns or exploratory committees.\n\nAnd while some Trump allies have been surprised by his lack of a hiring spree right out of the gate, his campaign has been content to maintain a lean operation while he’s the only candidate in the field. The former president is not expected to tap a formal campaign manager, instead elevating three trusted advisers – Susie Wiles, Brian Jack and Chris LaCivita – to senior roles, but allies said he will likely need to build out his on-the-ground staff in early voting states in the months to come, as well as a robust communications operation if he finds himself in a competitive primary.\n\nWhile those hires don’t need to happen immediately, people close to Trump said his early entry into the 2024 race does raise questions about how he will sustain campaign-related costs over a longer period than other candidates who declare later, including chief potential rival Ron DeSantis. CNN has previously reported that the Florida governor, should he decide to take on Trump, would announce next May or June, after the conclusion of his state’s legislative session and just months before the Republican party could host its first primary debate, according to a party official involved in debate planning.\n\n“The question a lot of us have is can Trump sustain a campaign for two years. That’s the real difficulty here. The pacing we’re seeing right now is designed to do that,” said a person close to Trump.\n\nIn addition to planning rallies and events and building momentum around the former President, the campaign staff is also looking at how to best insulate Trump after many were caught off guard learning of Trump’s dinner with Fuentes and West. The event, and the days of fallout and negative coverage, has expedited some of the campaign’s long-term plans, including ensuring a senior campaign staffer is always with the former president, a source familiar with the campaign said.\n\nTrump’s White House staff worked with resort staff during his presidency in a similar fashion to protect Trump from potentially “unsavory” guests of members, the source said. Those close to Trump blamed “low level staffers” for allowing Fuentes to slip into the resort without any flags being raised.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/21/trump-leads-gop-field-iowa-poll/70639433007/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Donald Trump holds commanding lead in first test of 2024 ...", "text": "© Copyright 2023, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nDonald Trump holds a commanding lead over the rest of the 2024 Republican presidential field in Iowa — and a more than 2-to-1 lead over his closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — with about five months to Caucus Day, a new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nThe poll of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers comes as the former president grapples with the fallout of a fourth criminal indictment and a pack of other top contenders prepares to gather for a high-stakes GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\nAmong those likely caucusgoers, 42% say they plan to support Trump — a lead of 23 percentage points over DeSantis, who is at 19%. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina follows in third place with 9%.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy follows with 4%.\n\nThe poll finds many indicators of Trump’s strength, but the race is not settled and may be “closer than it may first seem,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducted the poll.\n\nMore:See where presidential candidates are campaigning in Iowa\n\nSixty-three percent of likely GOP caucusgoers say they support Trump as their first or second choice in the caucuses or are actively considering him. That footprint is on par with the 61% who say the same for DeSantis.\n\nPlenty could shift by Caucus Day on Jan. 15.\n\nA majority, or 52%, of likely GOP caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate, while 40% say their minds are made up. Seven percent do not have a first-choice candidate.\n\nIn addition, just 7% of poll respondents say they are considering only one candidate for president. Seventeen percent say they are considering two candidates; 19% say three; and 55%, four or more.\n\nThe poll of 406 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 13-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nIt is the Iowa’s Poll’s first test of the field of 14 Republican candidates vying for their party’s chance to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nIn addition to the top contenders, seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nThey include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is at 2%, and former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, who has 1%.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Binkley, conservative radio host Larry Elder, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez all register below 1%.\n\nAs they think about which candidate to support, 65% of poll respondents say it’s most important to find a candidate who comes closest to their own views on issues, while 29% say it’s most important to pick a candidate who has the best chance of defeating Biden.\n\nDonald Trump’s legal challenges may be helping him in Iowa\n\nEven as Trump faces mounting legal troubles, his support appears only to grow.\n\nA grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump Aug. 15 for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election there.\n\nThe Iowa Poll, which was conducted Aug. 13-17, showed greater support for Trump in the days after the indictment was unveiled.\n\nIn the days before the indictment, Trump led DeSantis 38% to 20%. In the days after, his lead grew to 43% over DeSantis’ 18%.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint, combining his first-choice support, second choice and those actively considering him, also increased 12 percentage points after the Georgia indictment was announced — from 55% to 67%.\n\nDonald Trump leads, but Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott have room to grow\n\nAlthough Trump leads overall, the poll measures candidates’ full footprint of support in Iowa, where caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by Caucus Day.\n\nThe footprint adds together those who say the candidate is their first choice for president, those who say the candidate is their second choice and those who are actively considering supporting the candidate.By that measure, about as many likely GOP caucusgoers are considering DeSantis as are considering Trump.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint includes the 42% who say he is their first choice for president, 10% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him. That’s 63%, or nearly two-thirds of likely Republican caucusgoers, who are considering caucusing for Trump.\n\nDeSantis’ support includes the 19% who name him as their first choice, 20% who say he is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering him — totaling 61%.\n\nScott is the only other candidate whose Iowa footprint tops 50%.\n\nIn addition to the 9% who say Scott is their first choice for president, 15% say he is their second choice and 29% say they are actively considering him. That gives him an Iowa footprint of 53%.\n\nHaley’s Iowa footprint totals 40%, Ramaswamy’s is 34% and Pence’s is 31%.\n\nSelzer said other candidates have the opportunity to gain on Trump and turn people who are actively considering them into firm supporters, but “there’s a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrump’s support is more firmly locked in than DeSantis’; 66% of those who name Trump as their first choice say their minds are made up, while 34% say they could be persuaded to support someone else.\n\nFor DeSantis, it’s nearly the inverse, with 31% who say their minds are made up and 69% who could be persuaded.\n\nMore:Donald Trump, at Iowa fair, woos crowds, rebuffs 'wise guy' question on taking plea deal\n\nTrump also leads DeSantis among self-identified Republicans, the core of caucusgoers, 51% to 20%.\n\nAmong those who say they will be attending their first caucus in January, Trump leads the Florida governor 47% to 18%.\n\nAnd among evangelicals, an influential group in Iowa that’s often key to a caucus win, Trump leads with 47% who say he is their first choice for president. He’s followed by DeSantis, who gets 20% of evangelicals and Scott who gets 7%.\n\nPhil Marchand, a 42-year-old Sergeant Bluffs resident and poll respondent, said he caucused for Trump ahead of the 2016 election and has been “on the Trump train” ever since.\n\nMarchand is steadfast in his support for Trump in the current election cycle. He said he considered other Republican candidates, including DeSantis and Scott, but ultimately decided to caucus again for the former president come January.\n\n“The more time I spend listening to DeSantis and the more I listen to the things Trump is saying, the more I think that it has to be (Trump). It can’t be anyone else,” he said.\n\nMore:Trump is wrestling with 5 big legal cases. Here's how they may collide with the campaign calendar.\n\nMarchand said he appreciates Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy and his efforts to grow the economy and jobs.\n\nIf Trump does not receive the Republican nomination, Marchand said he would likely register as an independent and vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nIndependent caucusgoers could be ‘the way in’ for Trump challengers\n\nAmong independents, Trump and DeSantis are nearly evenly split, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nAnother 13% of independents support Scott, 12% support Christie, 10% support Haley and 6% each support Pence and Ramaswamy. No other candidate tops 5% with independents.\n\nSelf-identified independents who say they will likely caucus with Republicans make up 25% of the poll’s respondents.\n\n“To me, that's a little bit of something to be paying attention to,” Selzer said. “Because we've seen this happen in the past. A non-Trump candidate could say, 'I've got to get people to come to the caucus who are outside of the GOP base.’ So, if a candidate can grow the people who are coming to the caucuses, that is the way in, because Trump is strong with that base.”\n\nBrian Alstrom, a 48-year-old independent voter and poll respondent, said he would consider caucusing in January — if it looks like some of the candidates opposing Trump have a chance.\n\n“I did vote for him both times because it was the lesser of two evils,” Alstrom said of Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. “But it was hard to even listen to him speak. I’m just done with him. Hopefully I don’t have to vote for him again, because I’m not going to vote for Joe Biden.”\n\nAlstrom, who is a Dorchester resident, said he’s soured on Trump’s personal approach to managing conflicts and his combative attitude. He said DeSantis is his top choice for president, followed by Scott.\n\nIn DeSantis, Alstrom sees an appealing candidate with a “common sense approach” to issues that are important to him, such as the economy and national security.\n\n“Florida speaks for itself in how successful they’ve been,” he said. “... I’d love to see that transfer to the rest of our country.”\n\nDonald Trump has never been viewed favorably by more Iowa Republican caucusgoers\n\nSince his presidency ended and as he has mounted a third campaign for the White House, Trump has been criminally indicted four times, has attacked Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s popular Republican governor, and has held relatively few campaign events in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nAnd yet, Trump has never been viewed favorably by more of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers than he is now, the Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn August 2015, Trump was viewed favorably by 61% and unfavorably by 35% — his best showing among likely GOP caucusgoers during the 2016 caucus cycle. Trump went on to finish second in Iowa’s Republican caucuses behind U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nMore:Candidates try to clear GOP debate fundraising hurdles. Is it changing their Iowa strategy?\n\nNow, Trump is viewed favorably by 65%. That includes 42% who view him “very favorably” — the best showing of any of the 2024 candidates. Another 33% view him unfavorably, and 2% are not sure.\n\nTrump’s best showing is among self-identified Republicans, with 77% viewing him favorably and 21% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHe also does well with those who make less than $70,000 a year (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable) and among evangelicals (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable).\n\nDeSantis’ overall favorability numbers are about on par with Trump’s.\n\nThe Florida governor is viewed favorably by 66% of likely GOP caucusgoers and unfavorably by 29%. Another 5% are not sure.\n\nAmong self-identified Republicans, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 74% and unfavorably by 21% — numbers that are about equal to Trump’s.\n\nMore:Republican presidential candidates woo Iowa's pivotal evangelicals to pry them away from Trump\n\nPoll respondent Rick Williams, a 72-year-old Holstein resident and self-identified Republican, said he considers himself a Trump supporter and believes the former president is being unfairly targeted in the series of criminal indictments that have been unveiled this year.\n\nStill, he plans to support someone else in the caucuses. Right now, he prefers DeSantis.\n\n“Trump supporters are going to support him no matter what if he's the nominee,” Williams said. “But we need the independents. We can't win with just us. We've got to get the independents, and I don't know if he can swing them.”\n\nThe Florida governor has higher favorability ratings with independents than Trump: 52% view him favorably, and 43% view him unfavorably.\n\nMore:Mike Pence is asking Iowans to choose him for president. Some say Jan. 6 is 'holding him back'\n\nFor Trump, it’s the inverse: 44% of independents view him favorably, while a majority, 53%, view him unfavorably.\n\nWilliams, a semi-retired paramedic, said Scott is currently his second-choice candidate.\n\nScott is viewed favorably by 59% and unfavorably by 17%. But a higher percentage — 24% — are unsure, indicating they don’t know enough about him to say one way or the other.\n\nGenevieve Hefel, a 63-year-old Dubuque resident and poll respondent, said she voted for Trump in the 2020 election but has felt her support for the former president wane.\n\nBecause of the recent indictments, Hefel, a retired Army sergeant, said she believes there’s “too much noise” around Trump for him to be able to defeat a Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nHefel said she’s still considering other Republican contenders in the race, but she’s drawn to Scott’s “positive message and Christian beliefs” and plans to caucus for him.\n\n“He's able to carry on a conversation to get his point across without having to be ignorant or raise his voice,” Hefel said, reflecting on an interview she saw Scott give recently. “He handled it very professionally and calmly, and I thought he made very good points.”\n\nScott does best with those age 55 and older, with 70% viewing him favorably and 16% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHaley is viewed favorably by 53% and unfavorably by 26%. Another 21% are not sure.\n\nMike Pence, Chris Christie among those with highest unfavorable ratings\n\nSeven candidates are underwater, meaning more likely Republican caucusgoers view them unfavorably than favorably.\n\nThey include Binkley (12% favorable, 21% unfavorable), Hurd (13%-22%), Hutchinson (20%-32%), Johnson (18%-22%) and Suarez (12%-23%).\n\nPence is viewed favorably by 42% and unfavorably by 53%, with 5% who aren’t sure. Even though he’s underwater, a plurality — 33% — say they have a “mostly” favorable view of the former vice president.\n\nBut he holds no advantage with evangelicals, despite his efforts to highlight his own faith and connect with Iowa’s religious conservatives: 43% view him favorably and 51% view him unfavorably — numbers that mirror his overall favorability numbers.\n\nAmong all the candidates, Christie is viewed unfavorably by the greatest share of poll respondents, with 60% saying they view him unfavorably, including 31% who view him “very” unfavorably. Another 28% say they view him favorably and 12% say they’re not sure.\n\nNo 2024 presidential candidate performs better than Iowa’s own Republican elected officials.\n\nReynolds commands the highest numbers, with 81% viewing her favorably (including 50% who view her very favorably), 18% who view her unfavorably and 1% who are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is viewed favorably by 73%, unfavorably by 22%, and 5% are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst is viewed favorably by 72%, unfavorably by 24%, and 4% are not sure.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at bpfann@dmreg.com or 515-284-8244.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 406 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/herschel-walker-donald-trump-georgia/index.html", "title": "Herschel Walker's defeat delivers another blow to Trump and his ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump was hoping for a win on Tuesday amid the slow start to his latest presidential campaign, believing a victory for his longtime friend and hand-picked candidate Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate runoff would mitigate calls for new Republican leadership following a spate of losses for his endorsed candidates in high-profile 2022 races.\n\nInstead, Trump’s first cycle as a so-called GOP kingmaker ended with one final blow to his scorecard.\n\nWalker lost by nearly 3 percentage points to Sen. Raphael Warnock, handing Democrats a wider Senate majority than they’ve had the past two years and plunging the former president into deeper scrutiny as the GOP’s only declared 2024 contender.\n\n“OUR COUNTRY IS IN BIG TROUBLE. WHAT A MESS!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site shortly after several networks called the race for Warnock late Tuesday night.\n\nOne source close to Trump said the Georgia results were likely to further damage the 2024 Republican hopeful’s third presidential campaign, which has been marred by a series of self-inflicted wounds and legal troubles in the three weeks since Trump announced he was running.\n\n“This is really, really bad,” this person said.\n\nMany in the former president’s orbit are concerned that this will boost demand for other Republicans to challenge him for the party’s presidential nomination.\n\n“Trump backed the wrong candidates and lost virtually all of them in the Senate in 2022. He then goes and attacks two of the most popular Republican governors, the governor of Virginia and Florida, and now he talks about terminating the Constitution. He’s destroying himself,” longtime GOP pollster Frank Luntz told CNN.\n\nIn the six states where Trump’s MAGA Inc. political action committee spent tens of millions boosting candidates with his backing, he notched only one victory: Sen.-elect J.D. Vance in Ohio, a state that has trended Republican in recent years. Trump aides insist he remains pleased with his roughly 80% success rate for the 250-plus endorsements he doled out this cycle – many of which went to heavily favored incumbents, Republican hopefuls running for reliably red seats, or candidates who ran unopposed – even as the former president has privately complained to allies about the blame he’s facing for elevating low-caliber candidates and suggesting that many of them could have run better campaigns, sources said.\n\n“Conservatives across the country are tired of losing. 2024 is key to winning the future again. Choose well,” Bob Vander Plaats, a prominent Iowa Republican who endorsed Trump’s 2020 reelection bid, wrote on Twitter late Tuesday as Walker appeared headed for defeat.\n\nErick Erickson, a Georgia-based conservative radio host who also endorsed Trump in 2020, said Tuesday’s outcome in his home state further demonstrated that voters “in the swing states that matter have kept rejecting candidates tied to Trump.”\n\n“You want to win? Move on from an angry old man with nothing left but a knockoff Twitter feed. And move on from candidates who are objectively not good fits,” Erickson wrote in a Wednesday morning column, suggesting that Walker, a candidate besieged by domestic abuse allegations and claims that he paid for multiple abortions, didn’t lose solely because of Trump and but likely wouldn’t have entered the Senate race last summer had the former president not encouraged him to. Walker has denied the allegations from two separate women who claim he encouraged them to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n‘I want to back a winner’\n\nMembers of Trump’s orbit had hoped for a Walker win to breathe new energy into the former president’s own stagnant campaign, but are now grappling with the reality that this has likely set them back farther.\n\nOne Mar-a-Lago member who is close to Trump said the former president’s 2022 scorecard has cemented his decision to financially support an alternative in the Republican presidential primary, most likely Ron DeSantis if the Florida governor runs.\n\n“Donald’s got his problems right now and they are so numerous that I don’t think he can win and I want to back a winner,” this person said. “There are a lot of friends of mine who don’t want to have Trump at the top of the ticket because they feel it’s a killer.”\n\nThomas Peterffy, a billionaire GOP donor who lives just down the street from Trump in Palm Beach, said the former president “is to blame for many of the Republican losses in the gubernatorial and senatorial races” this cycle.\n\n“Right now, I think his negatives are so much stronger than his positives,” said Peterffy, who has met with some of Trump’s potential 2024 rivals.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Trump’s team was bracing for a deluge of blame to be placed on the former president for the Georgia outcome, in addition to other party leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, National Republican Senatorial Committee chief Rick Scott, and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, all of whom have faced calls from fellow Republicans to either step down from their leadership roles or stop enabling Trump’s influence.\n\nBut while some Republican operatives have called for the party to reevaluate its election tactics and chart a new course, others said Trump’s grip on the GOP should never be underestimated.\n\nThe former president has faced a seemingly endless string of legal troubles since mounting his 2016 campaign for the White House and constantly attracts bipartisan scrutiny for his behavior – and still, throngs of grassroots Republicans remain besotted with the former businessman. Rarely has he seen a significant chunk of his supporters wander away from him.\n\n“There is still a large portion of the Republican base who only care about Donald Trump,” one former Trump Republican told CNN.\n\nTrump allies and advisers hope he can keep his grip on that portion of the party as the 2022 cycle reaches its conclusion and voters and rumored Republican presidential hopefuls shift their attention to the 2024 primary season. But some aren’t sure he still wields the same power that he did even just months ago, before the November midterms, when GOP lawmakers and candidates were flocking to his Mar-a-Lago club for meetings and fundraisers and polls showed him drawing steady support among Republican voters.\n\n“(Trump is) still very popular in the party. People appreciate his presidency. They appreciate his fighting spirit. But there’s beginning to be a sense, can he win?” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, told CNN.\n\nIn the weeks since his campaign announcement, signs of Trump’s dwindling power over the party have been on full display as some Republicans seem emboldened to publicly distance themselves from the former president and former allies – including Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo – have indicated that they are prepared to potentially take him on in 2024.\n\n“You just can’t deny what the results are. You can’t go around sincerely saying, ‘(Trump) is not a drag on the party,’ and won’t be a profoundly negative force if he winds up on the top of the ticket in 2024,” said a former Trump campaign official.\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that the former president’s 2024 strategy “is being implemented even though the presidential calendar hasn’t been set yet and the 2022 midterm cycle just ended.”\n\n“President Trump is the single most dominant force in politics and people – especially those who purport to be close to him – should never doubt his ability to win in a decisive and dominant fashion,” Cheung said.\n\nOther hurdles\n\nEven before Walker lost Tuesday’s runoff, Trump’s 2024 campaign had been confronted with setbacks.\n\nWithin days of Trump announcing his run, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to take over two criminal investigations into the former president and his associates surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents after leaving office. Then, shortly before Thanksgiving, Trump drew widespread backlash for dining with Kanye West, who has spent the past month publicly spouting antisemitic remarks, and White nationalist Nick Fuentes at his Palm Beach residence. He then drew a fresh round of criticism this week after calling for the “termination” of the US Constitution in a Truth Social post over the weekend to allow him to be reinstated as president. And on Tuesday, just hours before Walker’s defeat, Trump’s Manhattan-based real estate company was convicted by a New York City jury on multiple charges of tax fraud and other financial crimes.\n\n“The special counsel wasn’t a huge surprise but the Kanye dinner was a completely avoidable mistake,” said one Trump adviser. “It made his campaign look completely incompetent and that’s catnip for potential rivals.”\n\nTrump’s physical avoidance of Georgia also raised questions about his ability to appeal to crucial swing state voters, who will likely hold the key to another term in Washington if he emerges on the other side of the 2024 GOP primary as the party’s nominee. After not visiting Georgia ahead of the November midterm elections, Trump continued to keep his distance before the runoffs. The former president did host a tele-rally on Monday, hoping to galvanize Republican voters to support Walker the following day.\n\nBut that decision was welcomed by Georgia Republicans, given Trump’s relationship with the Peach State.\n\nAfter winning Georgia in 2016, Trump’s record across the state has spiraled downward. In 2020, he became the first GOP presidential candidate to lose Georgia in nearly three decades, only to lash out at statewide Republican officeholders, baselessly accusing them of concealing widespread voter fraud for which he provided no evidence. Shortly after his defeat, the state’s two incumbent Republican senators – Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue – lost their respective runoff contests against Jon Ossoff and Warnock, handing Democrats a slim Senate majority at the beginning of Joe Biden’s presidency. Many in the party blamed Trump’s election denialism and criticism of mail-in ballots for lower party turnout in those runoff contests.\n\n“There were many in 2020 saying, ‘Don’t vote by mail. Don’t vote early,’ and we have to stop that and understand that if Democrats are getting ballots in for a month, we can’t expect to get it all done in one day,” McDaniel, the current RNC chairwoman, said in an apparent reference to Trump during a Fox News appearance just hours before polls closed on Tuesday.\n\nAnd after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger refused to help Trump overturn Biden’s victory in the state, Trump waged an effort to exact political retribution, endorsing unsuccessful primary challenges against the two men. Kemp and Raffensberger went on to handily win their general election contests last month.\n\nIn part because of his losing record in the state, aides to both Walker and Trump believed the political risk was too great for Trump to appear alongside Walker. Still, the two men continued to speak by phone regularly in the lead up to the November midterms – and his ultimate defeat on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Kristen Holmes Gaborr", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/12/2024-presidential-election-who-running/11648842002/", "title": "Tim Scott eyes White House bid: Who is running for president in 2024?", "text": "As the country moves closer to the 2024 election, candidates seeking the White House are beginning to formally throw their hats into the ring.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen.

Two more years!\" at his victory party - signaling they want him to seek the presidency.\n\nSome analysts said the Republican establishment must confront Trump if it is to regain the majority.\n\nWASHINGTON – After Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis cruised to a blockbuster reelection win last week, some supporters cheered for him to start planning another campaign: a 2024 Republican presidential bid against Donald Trump.\n\n\"Two more years! Two more years!\" they chanted at a victory rally where DeSantis became the brightest star on a dim election night for Republicans. The GOP's lackluster performance in an array of congressional races dented Trump's aura of inevitability and created a bigger opening for a potential challenger to the former president, who is hinting he may announce a fresh presidential bid Tuesday.\n\nDays after the midterms, Trump is playing defense and attacking Republicans who blame him for GOP losses and want the party to move past the volatile ex-president.\n\nDeSantis' emergence adds an element of uncertainty to an already unprecedented election cycle: a former president trying to become the first to regain the White House since Grover Cleveland in 1892 – all while facing a series of criminal investigations and possible indictments.\n\nTrump, who watched the election returns from his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, appears intent on diminishing DeSantis, calling him \"average REPUBLICAN Governor with great Public Relations\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\nDeSantis has remained mum on 2024 plans, as he and aides say he wants to focus on Florida issues.\n\n\"Florida is the center of gravity for Republican politics,\" said David Urban, a Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist and former campaign adviser to Trump. \"But the headquarters is no longer in Mar-a-Lago; it's shifted to Tallahassee.\"\n\nTrump vs. DeSantis? What happens now?\n\nIn the wake of the midterm debacle, Republican political consultants are trying to game out a potential Trump-DeSantis battle royal.\n\nIt may depend on how many other Republicans jump into the fray. Former Vice President Mike Pence is among several Republicans who may give it a go. Trump benefited from a crowded field in 2016, capturing the populist wing of the GOP while other candidates split the anti-Trump vote.\n\nIf Trump is hoping his announcement and his attacks will force DeSantis to commit one way or another, he is likely to be disappointed, analysts said. They don't expect DeSantis to make his announcement until the late spring or summer of next year because he already has a day job.\n\nWith the Florida legislature scheduled to meet March 7 through May 5, pollster Frank Luntz and others said DeSantis would be wise to continue building a solid record as governor before making a presidential announcement – a formal announcement, that is.\n\nBehind the scenes, DeSantis will probably be sounding out people to play roles in campaign and fundraising organization, consultants said. In some ways that process has already begun: DeSantis traveled extensively during the midterm elections, speaking for GOP candidates in battleground states such as Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"He should be on the phone right now, reaching out,\" Luntz said.\n\nThe set-up: The 2024 presidential race in 2022: What to know about Trump, DeSantis, Pence and Biden\n\nTrump tease: Donald Trump tells Iowa crowd: 'I will very, very, very probably' run for president\n\nDeSantis isn't going to stop making national appearances. He is one of several potential presidential candidates who is scheduled to address the Republican Jewish Coalition at its annual leadership meeting next weekend in Las Vegas.\n\nDeSantis can run for president on a gubernatorial record that ranges from tax relief to legislative rollbacks to countering allegedly \"woke\" Democrats and corporations, such as Disney, after it objected to the so-called to legislation critics called Florida’s \"Don't Say Gay\" bill regarding elementary schools.\n\n\"We will never ever surrender to the woke mob,\" DeSantis said in his victory speech. \"Florida is where woke goes to die!\"\n\nDeSantis' combativeness – he once sent a plane to Texas to transport Venezuelan migrants to Martha's Vineyard – made him a Republican star before Tuesday's election. His reelection win by more than 19 percentage points – in Florida, a pivotal state in any presidential election – made him the Republican of the moment and a serious presidential aspirant, analysts said.\n\nAbove all, Republican consultant Alex Conant said DeSantis \"needs to run his own campaign,\" and not let Trump or anybody else \"dictate his strategy.\"\n\nThat includes ignoring Trump's constant gibes, said Conant, who worked for Marco Rubio's presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n\"No one's ever gotten into the mud with Trump and come out better for it,\" Conant said.\n\nOf course, that may be easier said than done.\n\nTrump taunted Bush, Rubio and Cruz in 2016. Now, he's targeting DeSantis.\n\nIf the past is any guide, Trump will continue targeting DeSantis for as long as it takes, taunting him the same way he mocked Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and other Republican opponents in 2016.\n\nThis time, however, Trump is attacking from a defense posture.\n\nMany in the party are angry at him for dominating the spotlight in the final weeks of the midterms in campaign rallies that fired up Democrats and reminded some swing voters about what they dislike about the GOP.\n\nTrump's role as kingmaker during the GOP primaries is also coming back to haunt him. Many of the candidates he favored, such as Pennsylvania Senate contender Mehmet Oz, ended up losing. Don Bolduc, a Senate candidate in New Hampshire who embraced Trump's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, also went down to defeat.\n\n\"You look all over the country, there’s a very high correlation between MAGA candidates and big losses, or at least dramatically underperforming,” Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., told CNN. Toomey is retiring from the Senate seat that Oz lost to Democrat John Fetterman.\n\nFormer Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News that Trump should at least delay his 2024 announcement until after a Senate runoff election in Georgia on Dec. 6.\n\n\"I think he needs to put it on pause, absolutely,\" McEnany said.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, predicted to Fox: \"There’s going to be a lot of distancing: Of money, of voters, of folks saying clearly they have decided it’s time for us to move on.”\n\nIt is unlikely Trump will heed these complaints.\n\nHis counterattacks have included racism. In one Truth Social post, Trump taunted another possible Republican presidential aspirant, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin: \"Young Kin (now that’s an interesting take. Sounds Chinese, doesn’t it?).\"\n\nTrump has been in trouble before, especially after the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, and subsequent impeachment. Yet he continued to dominate the Republican Party right up to the 2022 reversals.\n\n'Trumpty-Dumpty'?\n\nWith votes still being counted nationwide, the GOP appears favored to win the House; but even if it does, it will be by the most slender of margins – far from the \"red wave\" party leaders hoped for.\n\nDemocrats retained control of the Senate.\n\nAs a result, even Trump-friendly media organizations are urging the GOP to move past the ex-president.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page described Trump as the GOP's \"biggest loser\" of the election, and said \"Trumpy Republican candidates failed at the ballot box in states that were clearly winnable.\"\n\nPence vs. Trump?Pence might not vote for Trump in 2024, says there might be 'somebody else' he'd prefer\n\nTrump failed to win the popular vote in 2016, and has been unable to develop GOP majorities in 2018, 2020 and now 2022, skeptics pointed out. Said the Journal: \"Since his unlikely victory in 2016 against the widely disliked Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump has a perfect record of electoral defeat.\"\n\nThe New York Post, which like the Journal is owned by conservative stalwart Rupert Murdoch, made its point via its patented screaming headlines. \"TRUMPTY DUMPTY,\" said one.\n\nAnother New York Post headline praised DeSantis as \"DeFUTURE.\"\n\nEven so, challenging Trump would not be easy.\n\nSarah Longwell, an anti-Trump Republican political consultant who conducted numerous focus groups of GOP voters during the 2022 cycle, said \"there's a real appetite among GOP voters for a Ron DeSantis run.\"\n\nBut she added it will be hard for DeSantis or any other Republican to \"take the GOP back from Trump,\" given his hold on large segments of the party and his willingness to viciously attack anyone who gets in his way.\n\n\"He doesn't own the party,\" she said. \"He owns the base, and the base is quite large.\"\n\nPence, other potential rivals and legal complications for Trump\n\nThe fate of a Trump-DeSantis race could also be decided in part by other Republicans who run.\n\nThey include Trump's former vice president. Pence is about to embark on a media tour for his book, which is to be published Tuesday, the same day Trump is planning to make his announcement about 2024.\n\nFlorida connection: Love him or hate him, Ron DeSantis is Republican Party's best shot at moving past Trump\n\nAny number of other long-shot Republicans could also jump into the fray.\n\nPossibilities include several Republican senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas, a runner-up to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential race; Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican in the Senate; and Rick Scott of Florida, who ran the GOP's Senate campaign committee.\n\nFormer Republican officials are also taking a look at 2016, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nPompeo appeared to take a shot at Trump by tweeting that \"conservatives are elected when we deliver. Not when we just rail on social media.\"\n\nA Trump presidential bid is also subject to unpredictable events: a series of criminal investigations.\n\nTrump faces possible indictments over efforts in Georgia to overturn his election loss in 2020; any involvement he may have had in the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021; and claims that he stole classified information upon exiting the White House.\n\nDeSantis-Trump history\n\nFor now, Trump is showing every sign he takes seriously the prospect of a DeSantis challenge.\n\nEven before Election Day, Trump threatened DeSantis, telling reporters: \"If he did run, I will tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering. I know more about him than anybody other than perhaps his wife, who is really running his campaign.”\n\nBut they were once friendly.\n\nTrump endorsed DeSantis during his first campaign for Florida governor in 2018 and still takes credit for his victory. In fact, DeSantis won despite Trump. He eked out a close victory in a midterm election during the Trump presidency in which the president's unpopularity dragged down most Republican candidates.\n\nWatching Trump and DeSantis: 'It'd be fun'\n\nThere are signs Trump's grip on the party may be loosening.\n\nIn a recent NBC News poll, Republicans said they considered themselves bigger supporters of the party than of Trump by a margin of 62%-30%, the biggest gap yet on that question.\n\nTrump-Biden, redux: Run again? Poll finds Biden's bad 2024 numbers get better, Trump's bad numbers get worse\n\nExit polls from the midterm election generated bad numbers for Trump; 60% of respondents had an unfavorable view of him, raising questions about how he might fare against President Joe Biden or any other Democrat.\n\nAs Trump plans to announce – and DeSantis prepares for the early part of his second term – Republican strategists will be busy studying polls and interpreting the candidates' comments, right on up to the Iowa caucuses in early 2024.\n\nDemocrats will also be watching, hopeful that a Trump-DeSantis blowout will further fracture a divided opponent.\n\nThose include Biden, whose standing is enhanced by the midterm election results and who is clearly enjoying the emerging Trump-DeSantis show.\n\n\"It'd be fun watching them take on each other,\" he said last week.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/gop-midterms-trump-2024/index.html", "title": "Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid disappointing GOP ...", "text": "Palm Beach, Florida CNN —\n\nDonald Trump wanted to catapult himself into a third presidential campaign with a wave of Republican midterm gains behind him. Instead, he emerges from Tuesday’s underwhelming election night facing questions about his political future and with the momentum behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, potentially his potential chief nemesis in a 2024 primary.\n\nWith key races still too early to call in Arizona and Nevada, and with Georgia heading to a Senate runoff, Trump entered Wednesday with few victories to tout and the possibility that they might soon be overshadowed by further losses.\n\nHis chosen candidates for open Senate seats in Ohio and North Carolina prevailed, as did incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But he lost a critical Senate contest in Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz, whom he backed in the primary despite widespread concerns about his electability, was defeated by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Michigan, Trump’s candidate in the governor’s race failed to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And while Republicans still appear to be on track to capture a House majority, it is likely to be far slimmer than initially thought.\n\nAs powerful as Trump is in the Republican Party, we learned that he cannot anoint anyone a winner. You still need candidates who have the fundamentals,” said Bryan Lanza, a longtime Trump adviser.\n\nOthers were more blunt in their assessment of Tuesday’s known outcomes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-Trump official: Election shows that Trump is holding GOP back 00:49 - Source: CNN\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican who won reelection and was endorsed by Trump, appeared to cast the former president as a drag on other GOP candidates in a radio interview Wednesday.\n\n“There’s just a lot of negative attitudes about Trump,” Nehls said. In a statement to CNN after this story published, the congressman said he remains supportive of Trump and “will support him as the 47th president.”\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, a current Trump adviser, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, conceded that Trump “is in a tough spot coming out of tonight.”\n\n“Two narratives are going to take hold over the next week and neither one is going to be easy to dispel,” the adviser said.\n\nAcutely aware of his unprecedented involvement in Republican primaries earlier this year, this adviser and other Trump allies said they expect the former president will be blamed for elevating flawed candidates in some of the party’s most important contests – especially Oz, a daytime talk show host who had barely resided in Pennsylvania before launching his Senate campaign there.\n\nTrump’s disappointment was palpable inside the gilded ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he gathered with dozens of aides, allies and donors to watch returns on Tuesday evening. When he returned to the party halfway through the night following a private dinner, his mood had visibly shifted.\n\n“Interesting evening,” he shouted to reporters before taking the stage for brief and unenthused remarks.\n\nAs the crowd dwindled, Trump sat at a table in front of a television tuned to Fox News with just a handful of advisers. Meanwhile, several guests whose names appeared on a VIP list that one Trump adviser circulated to reporters were nowhere to be found, including some who apparently decided to skip the event – surfacing as television pundits throughout the night from studios elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe end result was the exact scenario Trump’s advisers had hoped to avoid: an election where his top recruits fizzled or flopped and his primary Republican rival soared to new stardom.\n\nSources familiar with the matter said Trump left the party at the end of the night in a sour mood and resentful of the attention on DeSantis, who won reelection with a monstrous margin of victory and became the first Republican governor to carry Miami-Dade County, a densely populated and diverse area, for the first time in two decades. Just hours before the Florida governor’s victory, Trump had trashed DeSantis in comments to reporters aboard his 757 plane, threatening to dish unflattering information about him and suggesting he could have been more “gracious” for Trump’s endorsement in his 2018 bid for the governor’s mansion.\n\n“It wasn’t a great night for Trump and makes 2024 more competitive,” said one Republican operative.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump was in touch with allies in early 2024 voting states as he worked to develop a message that could carry him forward, according to two people briefed on those talks. In Iowa, Trump plans to tout Republican Brenna Bird’s defeat of incumbent Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller even though he didn’t endorse Bird until November 5, three days before her election.\n\nAs he works to plot his next steps, one of the biggest questions he is grappling with is how to approach DeSantis, sources said.\n\nBefore his resounding success on Tuesday, the Florida governor “was already having a moment but the spotlight just quadrupled in intensity,” said one Trump adviser.\n\n“We’ve got to figure out how to get it back before next Tuesday,” the Trump adviser added, referring to the “big announcement” Trump has teased for November 15, when he is expected to formally declare his third campaign for the White House. DeSantis’ strength was reflected in CNN exit polls on Tuesday, which showed the Republican governor exceeding President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin of victory among Latino voters in Florida and maintaining a small edge among independents, which Biden carried in the state by 11 points two years ago.\n\nBoth data points could prove compelling GOP primary between DeSantis and Trump, who made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in some 2020 states but not to the degree of the Florida Republican.\n\nTwo people close to the former president said he backed himself into a corner by publicly setting a date for his expected campaign announcement before the outcome of the midterm elections was known, something he did at an Ohio campaign rally on election eve to compromise with allies who did not want him to use the event as the launch site for his campaign.\n\n“He has to [announce],” said a source close to Trump, adding that it is too late for him to back out. “It would be embarrassing.”\n\nAnother Trump ally noted it would be “less embarrassing to delay than to get out there to a bunch of silence.”\n\nSome in Trump’s circle hoped a runoff in Georgia could help the former president delay the announcement and save face.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said that Herschel Walker – who will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December 6 runoff, CNN projected Wednesday – should be the priority.\n\n“I’ll be advising him to delay it until after the Georgia runoff, assuming that’s where the race is still trending,” Miller said.\n\nOthers expect that advice will fall on deaf ears. One source noted that Trump had so far been resistant to arguments that he should postpone his announcement and as of Wednesday morning, it was still unclear to some of the former president’s closest aides how he would handle his 2024 ambitions. Would he proceed defiantly – launching a campaign with disregard for the potential obstacles that lie ahead – or entertain a rare recalculation?\n\n“I could see him claiming that Republicans didn’t turn out in droves because he wasn’t on the ballot and blaming everyone but himself,” said one of his advisers.\n\nDesire to be a kingmaker\n\nFor Trump, Tuesday’s underwhelming results followed months of intense engagement in a midterm cycle that marked a notable departure from the post-presidential activities of his modern predecessors. As early as last summer, he began working to recruit candidates for key Senate contests who would advance his false claims about the 2020 election.\n\n“He wanted to be seen as a legendary kingmaker,” said a former Trump campaign official.\n\nBy this spring, Trump was directly meddling in contested primaries – endorsing candidates he deemed to be the most MAGA, criticizing their opponents in statements and Truth Social posts, and patently ignoring advice from some of his advisers to remain on the sidelines until the general election began. Trump often argued that his involvement would pay dividends in the end, not only ushering in majorities in both congressional chambers but ensuring elected officials loyal to him – not the party – were installed in Washington and key governor’s mansions.\n\nIn many cases, even candidates that Trump didn’t endorse emblazoned their campaign websites with his image or familiar phrases like “America First” or “MAGA fighter.” Throughout the cycle, GOP contenders regularly trekked to Mar-a-Lago to seek his support. Others shelled out thousands of dollars to host fundraising events at the waterfront property, hoping the former president would take note of their devotion and reward them with an endorsement.\n\nTrump ended the cycle by spending more than $16 million through his MAGA Inc. super PAC in the final weeks to boost many of his hand-picked candidates and link his top Democratic targets to Biden, who has grappled with sinking favorability during his first two years in office. Hours before results began pouring in on Tuesday, Trump’s team circulated a memo touting his “unprecedented success in 2022” that quantified his campaign trail appearances and assistance to Republican candidates.\n\n“President Donald J. Trump has endorsed over 330 candidates this election cycle,” the memo read, adding that Trump has “raised nearly $350 million” for GOP candidates and the party overall since leaving office.\n\nWith votes still being tabulated in some states, it is unclear just how many of the hundreds of candidates who earned Trump’s endorsement prevailed on Tuesday. What is clear is that Trump allies entered Tuesday night believing it would be an undeniable success for the 45th president.\n\nAs he gathered with other Trump campaign alums at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Miller described the former president as a “juggernaut” at the beginning of the evening.\n\n“It will be a much different-looking party now because of the Trump MAGA movement,” Miller had predicted.\n\nAsked about the 330 endorsements that could make or break his political future, Trump himself began the night suggesting that he should emerge on the other side of the midterms unblemished, telling NewsNation hours before polls closed, “I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional statement from Rep.

The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here,\" DeSantis said.\n\nChris Christie: Kick Donald Trump 'off the island'\n\nNone of the Republican debaters wanted to vote one of their fellow candidates \"off the island,\" though Chris Christie suggested running Donald Trump out of the GOP primary.\n\n\"This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families all over this country,\" Christie said. \"He needs to be taken out of this process.\"\n\nOther candidates balked at the last question of the evening, one borrowed from the game show \"Survivor:\" Who would you vote \"off the island.\"\n\nDeSantis voiced his objection, calling it \"disrespectful\" to the candidates who showed up to the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRon DeSantis takes on Donald Trump over abortion\n\n“He should be here,” Ron DeSantis said of Donald Trump during Wednesday's debate, calling on the former president to explain his stance on abortion.\n\nTrump recently called the Florida governor’s six-week abortion ban “a terrible mistake” and refused to state his position on a federal ban, while on NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nDeSantis, who has also fielded criticism from anti-abortion advocates for not taking a strong enough national abortion stance, called out Democrats for what he said are extremist abortion rights positions.\n\n“We’re better off when everybody counts,” he said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Bring it, Tim:' South Carolina candidates Haley, Scott argue about experience\n\nThe two South Carolina candidates in this race went after each other over who has the better experience: Former Gov. Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n– David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia’s war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to “level with the American people” on the issue.\n\n“Just because…Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,” he said, bringing up the country’s ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, “A win for Russia is a win for China.” She added, “But I forgot, you like China.”\n\nRamaswamy hit back that “hurling personal insults” were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a “greenlight” to China to invade Taiwan. “Peace comes through strength,” Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n“This is where President Trump went wrong,” Haley said. “He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don’t know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‘I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American’\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said “I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.”\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n“We've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,” Pence said. “You empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida’s new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a “hoax” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida’s other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n“Florida is showing how it’s done,” DeSantis said, boasting his administration’s focus parents’ rights and having “eliminated critical race theory.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‘honey, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.’\n\n“Why is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?” Haley said. “When I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there’s two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n“It is our job to make sure that never happens,” Ramaswamy said. “But it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox. Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter.\n\n'Donald Duck': Chris Christie calls out Donald Trump for absence\n\nWhile answering a question on crime rates in America, Chris Christie took time to address Donald Trump directly, calling him too afraid to join the debate stage.\n\n“We’re going to call you Donald Duck,” Christie, who turned directly to the camera to address the former president, said Wednesday night.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTim Scott criticizes Vivek Ramaswamy after he says he's not ‘bought and paid for’\n\nIn the first Republican debate, Vivek Ramaswamy said that he was the only GOP candidate “not bought and paid for.” Scott invoked those comments in the Wednesday's debate when he criticized Ramaswamy over business in China.\n\nRamaswamy pushed back by saying that while he opened a subsidiary in China, what he did differently from other companies is that he “got the hell out of there.”\n\nWhat's the CCP? It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the “spirit” of Tim Scott’s comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n“I understand that hardship is not a choice,” Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes “victimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can’t fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn’t think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n“What I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing — showing up,” Scott told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right – and wrong\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in California will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nAnd one of the sponsors of the debate is the Fox Business Network, so expect a lot of discussion of the economy. You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden’s border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He’ll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‘vice presidential debate at best’\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. At least that’s how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” he told CBS News. “This is the JV team.”\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday’s discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is “running away” with the primary in every poll.\n\n“This is the XFL, and it’s entertainment, I guess,” he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president − and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn’t given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n“I think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,” he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion’s harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley’s comments during the event, saying abortion is “a moral issue.”\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate − she certainly garnered the best reviews − and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn’t alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn’t allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump’s four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him – while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. “It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. – John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country’s future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

Byron Donalds of Florida in 2020 had broken a law intended to keep money raised for a state campaign out of federal elections.\n\nBut election lawyer Brett Kappel closely followed the case, and he immediately thought of one person who could benefit greatly from the outcome: Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe Florida governor is shattering national fundraising records as he seeks a second term, attracting gobs of money from Republican donors eyeing DeSantis as a potential presidential candidate in 2024. At the end of May, DeSantis was sitting on $111 million – more money than any candidate has ever needed to win an election in the Sunshine State. More donations come in almost every day.\n\nKappel believes that the FEC’s inaction against Donalds could give DeSantis a blueprint for how to raise money for a prospective presidential campaign while still running for governor.\n\n“Every time the FEC deadlocks on one of these innovative financial structures, it’s a big neon sign saying, ‘Do this! You can get away with it!’” Kappel said.\n\nPublicly, DeSantis has dismissed questions about his future political ambitions. “Nice try,” DeSantis recently told “Fox & Friends” when asked if he would mount a campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the governor’s political team has already identified ways to turn the massive war chest DeSantis has raised for his reelection race into money that could be spent in a federal campaign, a source with knowledge of those conversations told CNN.\n\n“It can be done,” the source said.\n\nAs momentum builds for DeSantis to run for president as soon as next year, he is collecting donations from every corner of the Republican Party, from the wealthiest donors to everyday watchers of Fox News in each state. He has received millions in donations from Trump’s biggest financiers, such as Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, powerhouse Republican backers Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, and retired venture capitalist William Buckley, but also from megadonors who have never financially supported Trump, such as Ken Griffin, the billionaire who recently announced he was moving his investment firm Citadel from Chicago to Miami.\n\nAn individual involved in Republican fundraising in Florida said the expectation is DeSantis will raise about $200 million this cycle, and he will need less than half of it for his reelection campaign. That will leave DeSantis with at least $100 million in seed money for a super PAC to support a White House bid, giving him a financial head start that at the moment is only rivaled by Trump’s own fundraising machine. Trump’s Save America PAC had $106 million in its coffers as of May.\n\n“I think that’s totally the plan,” the individual said. “It would be ludicrous of anyone to try to dissuade you that it’s not what’s happening.”\n\nDeSantis’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n‘DeSantis will be able to do what he wants’\n\nUnlike donations to a candidate’s campaign, there are no caps on contributions to super PACs. As it is, super PACs have become a key cog in the election efforts of most serious presidential contenders. There are still some limitations on super PACs (for example, they can’t raise money from federal contractors or foreign nationals), but the laws are tested and stretched each election cycle.\n\nOn paper, the law discourages candidates from turning money raised for a state race from supporting a federal campaign. But the FEC, divided between three Republican commissioners and three Democrats, hasn’t demonstrated an appetite for pursuing complaints against super PACs that violate the spirit of that law, said Daniel Weiner, a former lawyer for an FEC commissioner and now at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n“A lot of this falls into the gray area, and the rules are only as strong as the people enforcing them,” Weiner said. “For the last decade plus, enforcement has been pretty weak. … As long as he does not blatantly violate the law, DeSantis will be able to do what he wants.”\n\nThe particulars of Donalds’ case before the FEC are strikingly similar to the situation DeSantis could find himself in next year.\n\nIn Florida, candidates often choose to fundraise through state-registered political committees. Much like super PACs, there are no limits to how much a state political committee can receive from any single entity, be it a person, corporation or dark money group.\n\nIn 2019, Donalds formed a state political committee called Friends of Byron Donalds and started raising money. Early in 2020, Donalds resigned as chairman of the committee and three days later filed to run for an open US House seat in southwest Florida.\n\nAround that time, a super PAC called Trusted Conservatives registered with the FEC. When Friends of Byron Donalds closed its doors in June 2020, it sent its remaining reserves, about $107,000, to Trusted Conservatives. For the next three months, Trusted Conservatives spent most of that money on ads supporting Donalds or tearing into his Republican primary challengers. Donalds ultimately won the race by just 777 votes and was elected to Congress that November.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, an election watchdog, filed a complaint arguing federal committees could not spend money raised for state races. The arrangement also seemed to violate federal rules that prohibit coordination between a super PAC and a candidate, the organization said. The FEC’s general counsel agreed and recommended action. Donalds’ legal team argued that he had left the political committee months before it disbanded and that he was not involved in directing the money to Trusted Conservatives.\n\nThe FEC split 3-3, and the case was closed.\n\nLike Donalds, DeSantis operates a state-registered political committee called Friends of Ron DeSantis. It has raised $115 million this campaign cycle.\n\nSaurav Ghosh, who spent seven years in the FEC’s Office of General Counsel, previously thought it would have been “really brazen” for DeSantis to build a super PAC with money collected by his political committee.\n\n“But in view of the Donalds (case), I think certain FEC commissioners have left open a major loophole for that to happen,” said Ghosh, who is now a director at the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nThe Republican FEC commissioners did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDeSantis’ political team includes Phil Cox, a veteran political operative who ran the super PAC supporting former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. DeSantis’ campaign, his political committee and the Republican Party of Florida have also combined to spend $21,000 in the past eight months at Dickinson Wright, a Washington, DC, law firm that specializes in advising super PACs.\n\n“DeSantis has built a team that knows how to do this,” the individual involved in Republican fundraising in Florida said.\n\nA super PAC named Ready for Ron launched earlier this year to encourage DeSantis to run for president. The committee, formed by longtime Republican consultant Ed Rollins, is unaffiliated with DeSantis, but it is already airing ads on Fox News.\n\n“The most important thing for a presidential candidate is who is running your campaign, but the second-most important issue is who is going to run the super PAC in a legally competent manner,” said Scott Reed, the former top strategist for the US Chamber of Commerce. “DeSantis being up this cycle allows him to do a dry run on fundraising. And he’s been wildly successful.”\n\nMillions coming in, little out the door\n\nFueling speculation that Desantis is raising money for two campaigns at the same time is the reality on the ground in Florida: He is building an unprecedented cash advantage and so far hasn’t tapped into it much.\n\nDeSantis has brought in more money than any gubernatorial candidate in US history that wasn’t self-funded, CNN first reported earlier this year, a record that grows each month when fundraising totals are updated. Since the start of June, his political committee has collected hundreds of donations, ranging from $1 to six figures, including $400,000 from the facility management company Florida Care, Inc.; $200,000 from former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner; and $100,000 from New Jersey investment company The Portopiccolo Group.\n\nThe $130 million his campaign has accumulated in the past four years far exceeds the $90 million that his predecessor, then-Gov. Rick Scott, spent to win reelection in 2014, a record at the time.\n\nScott, though, was one of the country’s least popular governors by the end of his first term and was a primary target of national Democrats, who still saw Florida as a tossup state. Scott needed every dollar he raised plus $18 million of his own money to narrowly win a second term against Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee.\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, is the heavy favorite in his bid for another four years in office. National Democrats so far have focused their energy and resources on governor’s races in other states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. No Democratic entity has so far reserved space on Florida’s airwaves. DeSantis won’t know who is opponent is until after the Democratic primary in late August, and neither challenger, Crist or state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, have come close to matching DeSantis’ fundraising.\n\nAt this point in 2014, Scott had already racked up more than $18 million in expenses. DeSantis has spent $7 million this year between his campaign and political committee. He has purchased a modest $1.8 million of commercial time for the fall, but has mostly relied on the free exposure he receives from local and national news outlets and conservative media organizations that often promote his agenda and brand. “Fox & Friends” recently featured the “Top Gun”-inspired campaign merchandise the DeSantis campaign is selling on its website.\n\nIt remains possible that by November, DeSantis will have used more money than expected. The source close to his political team said DeSantis wants “a big, blowout election win,”which could be costly to achieve.\n\nThe source added that DeSantis has not committed to challenging Trump in a GOP presidential primary. CNN previously reported that the former President has considered announcing his intention to run again from Florida as soon as October, in part to preempt DeSantis and bigfoot his former protege.\n\n“We’ve heard all of that,” the source said. “It does not change our deliberations.”\n\nReed said many donors want to “turn the chapter on Trump” and are placing their early bets on DeSantis as the GOP’s best chance in 2024.\n\n“It’s clear that DeSantis is building a national finance organization, with great success,” Reed said. “Your two best friends in politics are money and message, and he’s positioning himself to be in pole position when the gun goes off.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/child-vax-rates-school-mandates/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 vaccines will be on the 2023 vaccine schedule, but that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCovid-19 vaccines will be part of recommended immunization schedules in 2023 for both children and adults, after a unanimous vote by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nThat doesn’t make the vaccines mandatory for anyone, a point that was emphasized in a discussion before Thursday’s vote. The board members addressed concerns from the public that adding Covid-19 vaccinations to the schedule would force schools to require the shots.\n\n“We recognize that there is concern around this, but moving Covid-19 to the recommended immunization schedule does not impact what vaccines are required for school entrance, if any,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, a committee member and director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Indeed, there are vaccines that are on the schedule right now that are not required for school attendance in many jurisdictions, such as seasonal influenza. Local control matters, and we honor that. The decision around school entrance for vaccines rests where it did before, which is with the state level, the county level and at the municipal level, if it exists at all. They are the arbiters of what vaccines are required, if any, for school entry. This discussion does not change that.”\n\nIn fact, Covid-19 vaccines are explicitly banned from being included in school mandates in at least 20 states. Only California and the District of Columbia have announced that Covid-19 shots will be among mandated vaccinations for students, but those mandates were not implemented for this school year.\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since eligibility for the Covid-19 vaccine was expanded to include everyone in the US 5 and older, but coverage among children still lags behind that of adults. Even as these vaccines and the related mandates have become highly politicized over the course of the pandemic, experts say vaccine hesitancy among parents isn’t new.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 shot will not become mandatory for school, all 50 states do have laws requiring specific vaccines for students – most of which include shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and varicella.\n\nUptake for these vaccines, mandated by schools long before Covid-19, fell during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2020-21 school year, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell to less than 94% – dropping below the overall target of 95% that was set as an objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services in the Healthy People project for the first time in six years.\n\nA CNN analysis of the latest CDC data suggests that students in states with stricter school vaccine requirements are more likely to have their shots.\n\nAll school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAccording to the CNN analysis, states that were stricter with exemptions were much more likely to still meet the 95% coverage target. In the 2020-21 school year, an average of about 96% of kindergarten students had their MMR vaccine in states that allowed only medical exemptions, compared with 92% of students in states that also allowed philosophical or moral exemptions.\n\nThe full effect of the pandemic on children’s routine vaccination rates isn’t clear: It will be another few months before the CDC shares national data for compliance rates for mandatory vaccinations in the 2021-22 school year, and schools are in the midst of outreach and programming to ensure that as many students as possible will continue through the 2022-23 school year up to date on their vaccines.\n\nVaccine hesitancy isn’t new\n\nCorrecting the drop in vaccination coverage in students will probably depend more on better access to care, information and outreach – and school vaccine mandates can help.\n\nWith many people who are hesitant, it’s “because of something they’ve heard or something they’ve read,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician who co-authored a clinical report about countering vaccine hesitancy in 2016. “Most people [who are hesitant] have a very free-floating worry about vaccines. It’s not specific in most cases.”\n\nA small share of parents – about 2% or 3% – are adamantly opposed to vaccines, and that rate has stayed mostly consistent over the years, said Hackell, who is also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine.\n\nOverall vaccination coverage fell among kindergarteners in the 2020-21 school year, but the share of students who had an exemption also declined from 2.5% to 2.1%, according to CDC data. The rate has changed by less than 1 percentage point over the past 10 years.\n\nAbout 3% of kindergarteners in the US – about 120,000 students – were considered to be out of compliance with mandatory vaccines in the 2020-21 school year.\n\n“Mandates may not do anything to those people who would pull their kids out of public school,” Hackell said. “But the vast majority of parents are not opposed. They’re hesitant, or they’re uncertain. And when there’s pressure to do it for another reason, such as getting your kid into school, they come around.”\n\nResponsibility for enforcing vaccine mandates falls to the education system, and practices vary by state. Some students are ultimately turned away because they aren’t up to date, but most states offer provisional enrollment periods that allow kids to stay in school if they are in progress with at least one shot in a series or evidence of an upcoming appointment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, “school officials may prefer to keep students in school where they have access to education, safe supervision, nutrition, and social services while working with parents or guardians to get children vaccinated.”\n\nAnd many states do their best to help students stay up to date on their immunizations, with vaccination drives and direct followup with parents.\n\n“I think that the drop in the past year or two is partly pandemic-related,” Hackell said. “What we’re seeing, I think, is a little bit of a disparity between kids who have a medical home and have a private [doctor] versus kids who get their immunizations from a public source” like a school clinic.\n\nA model of high vaccination: Mississippi\n\nMississippi is an impressive example of finding ways to keep child vaccination rates high, Hackell says. Public schools are the only option for many in the state, where poverty rates are higher than anywhere else in the US.\n\nDespite the large public need and additional resource struggles that the pandemic brought, 99% of kindergarteners in Mississippi met required vaccination coverage in the 2020-21 school year – better than any other state, according to the CDC.\n\n“They’ve done a tremendous job at that,” Hackell said, and it demonstrates the power of mandates. Mississippi is strict with exemptions – one of just six states allowing medical reasons only – and just 0.1% of kindergarteners were exempt in the 2020-21 school year.\n\nHackell says he would be most concerned if he sees a sustained drop in vaccination rates for highly transmissible diseases, especially measles and polio. And he’s worried about pockets of low vaccination rates in certain communities.\n\nSchools are public spaces with a level of control, and 95% vaccination coverage is a goal with intent.\n\n“We know it’s never going to be 100% because there are some people who cannot medically be vaccinated. But if you have 95%, that means in any given school classroom of 30 kids, there might be one unvaccinated kid. And so if that child brings a case of something into the class, there’s nobody else to give it to,” he said. “It stops there with one case.”\n\nAnd when it comes to adding Covid-19 vaccines to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule, the focus is still on public health – not on adding another requirement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’ve had parents who come in my office, and I say, ‘What are you here for?’ And they say, ‘Well, we’re here for vaccines so that our kids can go to school.’ And I’ve said, ‘OK, I understand that, but really I’m not vaccinating so you can go to school, I’m vaccinating because I want to prevent serious disease and death in your kids,’ ” Dr. Matthew Daley, an ACIP member and senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said at Thursday’s advisory meeting.\n\n“And the fact that there’s a school immunization requirement helps because it brought you into the office, but that’s not my goal.

The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also signed off on the shots.\n\nVaccine makers already have begun shipping supplies of the new vaccines after receiving FDA approval.\n\nThe vaccines have been updated to target more recent variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, which has been evolving since it first appeared in late 2019. Although the variant targeted by the new shots is no longer the most commonly circulating one, studies have suggested that the new vaccines will be effective against current variants.\n\nWill the new vaccines fight BA.2.86?Should you be worried about latest COVID variant?\n\nRight now, a variant called EG.5 is the most common in the United States, according to CDC data, but it accounts for only about 22% of cases, with another half-dozen variants each accounting for 5% or more. All are part of the omicron family of variants, which began spreading globally around Thanksgiving of 2021.\n\nThat's likely why vaccines still provide protection, even against the newest variant. BA.2.86, which has not spread much in the U.S. yet, but which had raised early concerns because it has a large number of mutations distinguishing it from other variants.\n\nResearch presented at Tuesday's advisory committee meeting show that vaccines continue to provide people with safe, effective protection against COVID-19.\n\nThe people who get the most benefit from the shots are those at highest risk for severe disease from infection, including people with weakened immune systems from older age, health conditions or medications.\n\nThe federal advisory panel, which consists of 14 experts in infectious diseases, immunology, family medicine or medical research, recommends everyone get vaccinated, but particularly emphasized the need for vaccines for people who are:\n\n65 or older;\n\nInfants under 6 months;\n\nPregnant people; and\n\nThose younger than 65 who have conditions that affect their immune system, or are taking immune-suppressing medications to treat cancer, because of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, or following an organ transplant.\n\nCOVID-19 infections have been rising since early July, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. Hospitalizations are up nearly 16% and deaths about 11% in the week that ended Thursday, compared with the week before, though totals remain well below previous peaks.\n\nThe bivalent vaccine, which has been available since last year, is no longer recommended.\n\nWhat the data shows about COVID vaccines\n\nAs of this week, 700 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States.\n\nThey have proven safe overall, CDC data shows, despite short-term side effects and some cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart, largely among older adolescent males and young men. Myocarditis occurred most often after the second vaccine dose and was not seen after the most recent booster, though not very many in the most vulnerable age groups received that shot.\n\nThe only other safety signal picked up by national data was an increased risk for stroke among people over 65 who received both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines last winter. That risk was short-lived, however, and it's not clear exactly what was driving it, whether it was a coincidence or caused by the combined vaccines or an increase in COVID-19 infections, CDC officials told the committee.\n\nAbout 5 people per every 1 million vaccinated suffered a severe allergic reaction to the shot.\n\nAmong children hospitalized with COVID-19 this year, 75% of babies had no underlying health conditions, 59% of those ages 6 months to 2 years had no previous health problems and 42% of toddlers were otherwise healthy, CDC data shows. Among older children and adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19, asthma was the most common health condition followed by neurological disorders and obesity.\n\nOf babies hospitalized for COVID-19, 86% were unvaccinated. More than 60% of children ages 5-11 hospitalized with COVID-19 were unvaccinated and another 28% had not gotten a COVID-19 booster. Among adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19, only 6% were fully vaccinated and boosted, the data shows.\n\nFor adults hospitalized with COVID-19, most of all ages had three or more health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or neurological disorders. Many more adults of all age groups were hospitalized from COVID-19 than from flu between October of last year and July of this year.\n\nWhat the committee members considered\n\nThe lone member of the committee to vote against the recommendation said he supports the vaccine but felt it should be limited to people at highest risk for severe disease.\n\n“We really need to level with our patients and say what is known and is unknown rather than make a complete recommendation,” said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, a professor of pediatrics at The Ohio State University – Nationwide Children’s Hospital. He advocated a “shared decision-making” process for people outside the highest risk groups, in which patients and their doctors decide together whether a shot is beneficial.\n\nOther committee members opposed shared decision-making, saying it excluded people who did not have easy access to a doctor.\n\nPlus, CDC data found that a number of people, including half of the young children hospitalized from COVID-19, had no previous health conditions putting them at high risk for severe disease. Limiting vaccine access to people at high risk would prevent those who might not fit into a preordained category from getting vaccinated.\n\n“Those deaths are vaccine preventable,” said member Dr. Matthew Daley, a senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado in Aurora. “The disease burden does vary greatly by age, but there is serious illness, death across all age groups, including those without underlying medical conditions.\"\n\nThe other 12 members agreed and voted to recommend vaccination for everyone\n\n“I have been astonished at the number of people who have not been vaccinated,” said member Dr. Camille Kotton an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She said a clear, simple recommendation that allowed anyone to choose to get a vaccine would be the best, most equitable approach. “Let’s keep America strong. Healthy. Let’s do away with COVID-19 as best we can.”\n\nCOVID spike has GOP fighting over masksThe White House wants no part of it.\n\nWhich COVID vaccines will be available soon?\n\nThe FDA's actions Monday related just to the vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nBoth of their vaccines will be updated to target the omicron variant XBB.1.5, which was the dominant variant this spring and early summer.\n\nIt has since been replaced by other variants, but early research suggests the new vaccines will be protective against those, too.\n\nUnlike previous years of the pandemic, the government will no longer cover the cost of all COVID-19 vaccinations. People with health insurance should have coverage for the shot, but people without insurance may have to pay out of pocket for the $110 to $130 cost per shot.\n\nA third vaccine, made by Novavax, is also ready for delivery, though it was not covered by the FDA's action Monday. Novavax presented updated data on its vaccine at Tuesday's committee meeting. The FDA is considering emergency authorization for the vaccine in people ages 12 and up.\n\nAccording to the company, doses of the vaccine, which is protein-based and does not use the mRNA technology of the other two, arrived in the U.S. on Monday.\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted 13-1 earlier Wednesday in favor of recommending the expanded use of Covid-19 boosters for children in this age group.\n\nThe CDC had ​authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for use as a booster in ages 16 and 17 in December.\n\n“It is critical that we protect our children and teens from COVID-19 infection and the complications of severe disease,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a news release. “Today, I endorsed ACIP’s vote to expand eligibility and strengthen our recommendations for booster doses. We now recommend that all adolescents aged 12-17 years should receive a booster shot 5 months after their primary series. This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant. I encourage all parents to keep their children up to date with CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.”\n\nThe ACIP recommendation came after the members heard research on rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in young people who have gotten Covid-19 vaccines and noting that many parents are concerned about long-term side effects of vaccines. They also considered that vaccine uptake among 12- to 17-year-olds has slowed recently and weighed the record numbers of Covid-19 cases in children amid a surge of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\nThe CDC signed off Tuesday on shortening the booster interval from six months to five months for people who got the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It has also recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised 5- to 11-year-olds receive an additional primary dose 28 days after their second shot; only the Pfizer/BioNTech shot is authorized for that age group.\n\nPfizer’s booster dose contains the same amount of the vaccine as the initial doses: 30 micrograms.\n\nAdolescents ages 12 to 15 became eligible to receive their initial series of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in mid-May, opening vaccinations up to about 17 million additional people.\n\nNow, about half of the 12 to 15 population – about 8.7 million – is fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 5 million of them have been fully vaccinated for more than five months and are now eligible to receive a booster shot.\n\nChildren in this age group represent about 5% of the total US population.

That’s less than half of the nearly 180 million people who are eligible to receive their booster shot and about a fifth of the total US population.

Early reports out of South Africa, where omicron was first identified, indicate omicron is at least partially able to elude vaccine-induced protection, although most initial infections among the vaccinated have resulted in mild illness.\n\nDelta is the problem, not omicron. At least for now.\n\nThe latest mutation of the coronavirus, omicron, is making headlines across the nation. But the previous severe mutation, delta, is responsible for the soaring number of infections and hospitalizations across the nation. Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, says omicron, first identified in South Africa last month, \"almost certainly is not more severe\" than delta.\n\n\"There is some suggestion that it might even be less severe,\" Fauci told Agence France-Presse this week. \"When you look at some of the cohorts that are being followed in South Africa, the ratio between the number of infections and the number of hospitalizations seems to be less than with delta.\"\n\nNew cases in the U.S. climbed from an average of nearly 95,000 a day on Nov. 22 to almost 119,000 a day this week, and hospitalizations are up 25% from a month ago. The increases are almost entirely from the delta variant, though omicron has been confirmed in at least 21 states and is sure to spread even more.\n\nDeaths are running close to 1,600 a day on average, back up to where they were in October. And the overall U.S. death toll less than two years into the pandemic figures to hit the 800,000 milestone in a matter of days.\n\nFDA authorizes new COVID drug for people with serious health problems\n\nFederal health officials on Wednesday authorized a new COVID-19 antibody drug for people with serious health problems or allergies who can’t get adequate protection from vaccination. The AstraZeneca antibody drug cleared by the FDA is the first antibody treatment intended for long-term prevention against COVID-19 infection, rather than a short-term treatment. Beneficiaries will include cancer patients, organ transplant recipients and people taking immune-suppressing drugs for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Health experts estimate about 2% to 3% of the U.S. population falls into that group.\n\n“These people still have to shelter in place because they’re at really high risk of severe disease and death,” Dr. David Boulware of the University of Minnesota said ahead of the announcement. “So having this therapy will enable a lot of them to get back to their normal lives.”\n\nCOVID vaccine refusers fuel chain reaction of problems to health care\n\nThose who refuse to take COVID-19 vaccines are creating a deadly domino effect, a Michigan doctor is warning. They are getting sick, spreading the virus to loved ones and the community, filling hospital beds and using up scarce medical resources, said Dr. Marschall Runge, CEO of Michigan Medicine and dean of the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\n\"The bottom line is COVID-19 is not only life-threatening for those who have COVID-19. The surge of COVID-19 is putting others at risk by keeping us from delivering lifesaving care\" for everything from heart attacks to cancer to strokes, Runge said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe number of Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19 reached 200 million Wednesday amid a dispiriting holiday-season spike in cases and hospitalizations. Runge said the death rate from cardiovascular disease went up 3% in 2020 after years of steady declines because people delayed treatment. The unvaccinated make up the vast majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Michigan Medicine, Runge said, and every coronavirus patient who is on a ventilator is unvaccinated.\n\n\"It's a dire situation across the state right now,\" Runge said. \"The state of Michigan reached a record high (number of) hospitalized COVID-19 patients this week – the highest number since the very beginning of the pandemic, now more than a year and a half ago.\"\n\n– Kristen Jordan Shamus, Detroit Free Press\n\nVaccine makers updating jabs for omicron, await newer variants\n\nVaccine makers are preparing to update their jabs against the newest coronavirus threat even before it’s clear a change is needed. The World Health Organization has appointed an independent scientific panel to advise on whether the shots need reformulating. Experts doubt today’s shots will become useless but say it’s critical to see how fast companies could produce a reformulated dose and prove it works. Omicron is not likely to be the last worrisome mutation.\n\nOmicron “is pulling the fire alarm. Whether it turns out to be a false alarm, it would be really good to know if we can actually do this – get a new vaccine rolled out and be ready,” said immunologist E. John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe US is undercounting COVID deaths, researchers say\n\nData released by the CDC this week could help answer questions about what types of non-COVID deaths increased during the pandemic and which COVID-19 deaths have been misclassified as something else, such as a death from heart disease, stroke or a respiratory illness. Andrew Stokes, an assistant professor of demography and sociology at Boston University’s Department of Global Health, said the new data allows researchers to \"drill down\" to the county level and see how the pandemic is evolving locally.\n\n“That is unprecedented compared to where we were at just a year ago,\" Stokes said. “In a public health emergency, real-time surveillance is critical.\"\n\n– Dillon Bergin, Betsy Ladyzhets, Mohar Chatterjee and Derek Kravitz, Brown Institute for Media Innovation\n\nFinland prime minister apologizes for clubbing after COVID exposure\n\nFinland Prime Minister Sanna Marin, one of the world's youngest elected leaders, apologized this week after facing backlash for spending a night out in Helsinki after she was exposed to COVID-19. Marin explained in a Facebook post on Monday that she was told Saturday that Foreign Affairs Minister Pekka Haavisto had tested positive after being in close contact with her. But she said she was told ministers were not asked to quarantine as long as they had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSo, Marin and her husband met with friends and went out to dinner that night.

This would be a third dose for healthy children and a fourth dose for children who are immunocompromised.\n\nThe committee voted for the booster after hearing details about Pfizer’s application to the FDA to expand access to the boosters for this age group. Waning antibody levels have been seen in children who have received a primary vaccination series, and booster doses achieved antibody levels higher than what was seen after the primary series.\n\nThe company said data from its clinical trials showed it raised Omicron-fighting antibodies by 36 times in this age group. The trial that included 4,500 children ages 5 through 11 saw no new safety issues, according to the company.\n\n“Overall, the benefits of Covid vaccines continue to outweigh the risks as we continue to see, regardless of what age group is highlighted, receipt of the Covid vaccine primary series continues to be critically important for the prevention of severe Covid-19 morbidity and mortality and overall Covid-19 vaccine booster doses have been shown to increase protection against all outcomes in those 12 and over,” said Dr. Sara Oliver, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and the lead for the Covid-19 vaccines ACIP Work Group. “It’s likely that children ages 5 through 11 would benefit from a Covid-19 vaccine booster dose.”\n\nThe Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been tough on kids. Studies from the New York State Department of Health and the CDC found that the effectiveness of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for children ages 5 to 12 fell significantly during the Omicron surge, falling from 68% to about 12% against infection. Two doses of the vaccine did seem to keep kids out of the hospital.\n\nWhile not at the same levels as during the Omicron wave, Covid-19 cases among children have been increasing. The number of new Covid-19 cases among children in the US grew nearly 76% last week from two weeks prior, the American Academy of Pediatrics said Monday.\n\nAccording to the latest report from the CDC, 1,547 children have died of Covid-19 in the US and 364 of them were in the 5-11 year-old age range.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that almost 13.2 million kids in the US have tested positive for Covid-19 during the pandemic, with more than 5.3 million of those cases coming this year. Those numbers are probably undercounted, as testing has fallen off in much of the country.\n\nLooking at electronic health records, with more than 700,000 doses administered, there were no real safety problems found with the Pfizer vaccine in children, according to a presentation given to the committee.\n\nAnaphylaxis rates in children ages 5-11 following the Pfizer vaccination were comparable to the rate seen in people ages 12 and older. In the three months after the initial vaccine series, there were 10 potential cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, both types of heart inflammation, but four of those cases were determined not be related to the vaccination, the CDC said in its presentation.\n\n“The general picture is that myocarditis associated with mRNA vaccination relative to viral myocarditis tends to be clinically mild and patients have good prognosis and a fairly short recovery period,” the CDC’s Dr. Tom Shimabukuro told the committee.\n\nThe rates were also lower in this age group than were seen in adolescence. The rate was also lower after a booster dose.\n\nMost children, if they experienced any problems with the vaccine were considered non-serious, like pain at the injection site. This was similar to adults’ reaction after their second dose.\n\nVaccination is an important protection for children. The risk of dying from Covid-19 for children 12 years and older in February of 2020 was 20 times higher among unvaccinated children, compared to those with the primary vaccine series and a booster dose.\n\nWhile scientists initially believed that Covid-19 didn’t impact children nearly as much as it did adults, deaths from Covid-19 in 5 -11-year-olds were greater than for a number of other pediatric vaccine preventable diseases. In 2020, it was one of the leading causes of death for children in this age range.\n\n“It’s important to highlight that vaccine coverage for these other conditions, these other diseases, is relatively high, indicating that most parents accept vaccination for Hepatitis A, meningococcal, varicella, rubella and rotavirus even though deaths from these diseases are relatively rare,” said Dr. Matt Daley, who is chair of the COVID 19 vaccines workgroup and a senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research Kaiser Permanente Colorado.\n\nParents should also keep in mind that a child who gets Covid-19 can, like adults, develop long-Covid, Daley said, even after a child has a mild case of Covid-19. Long Covid symptoms can last for years after the initial infection. People who were previously vaccinated were less likely to have symptoms between 12 and 20 weeks after infection compared to those that were unvaccinated, the CDC said.\n\nChildren ages 5 - 11 were also the most vulnerable age group to develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, also known as MIS-C, a rare but serious Covid-19-related condition. Among this age group, there have been 3,800 MIS-C cases and 16 deaths, according to the CDC’s presentation.\n\n“Data do not suggest potential safety concerns regarding a Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster for children five to seven years of age beyond those previously identified in older age groups,” said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot in her safety findings presentation to the committee.\n\nTalbot was the one expert who voted against the booster dose for this age group. While she is in favor of vaccinating children against Covid-19, she thinks public health leaders should concentrate on the low vaccination rate among this age group instead of focusing on boosters.\n\n“I really want children to be vaccinated,” said Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University. “We really need to spend our time and effort on educating the 70% who have not been (vaccinated). Boosters are great once we’ve got everyone their first round and I think that needs to be a priority.”\n\nIn the 5-11 age group, only 35% of children have had one dose and only 28% are fully vaccinated according to the CDC.\n\nFollowing the ACIP vote, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky will decide whether to sign off on the ACIP recommendation.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWalensky, who gave opening remarks in the meeting advocated for more people of all ages to get the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n“There are too many who do not have the protection necessary as we face yet another increase in cases and hospitalizations,” she told the committee. “We all hoped to never see the death tolls rise this high, reaching a number that was unfathomable when we first learned of this virus.”\n\n“The sadness I feel for lives lost, the families devastated and the communities changed is steep,” Walensky added. “We have the tools we need to protect these people from severe disease and prevent any more tragic deaths.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/coronavirus-omicron-travel-vaccine-children-health-wellness/index.html", "title": "Should your child receive the updated Covid-19 booster? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nLast week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance recommending the updated Covid-19 booster for children ages 5 to 11.

If a child has not been vaccinated yet, are they eligible for the updated booster?\n\nTo guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health,” and the mother of two young children.\n\nCNN: Who is now eligible to receive the updated Covid-19 booster? Does it matter how many vaccines they’ve previously received?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: Essentially, everyone 5 and above can receive the new bivalent Covid-19 booster, as long as they have completed their primary vaccine series. It doesn’t matter how many boosters they may have had. That means a child who received just the initial two doses of Pfizer or Moderna can get the booster, as can a child who already got one booster dose, as long as it’s been at least two months since their last vaccine dose.\n\nCNN: What should parents and caregivers consider before choosing the updated booster for their children?\n\nWen: There are two key questions to ask. First, is your child at high risk for severe illness due to Covid-19? The most important reason to get vaccinated is to reduce the chance of hospitalization and other severe outcomes. The initial two doses of the vaccine are very good at achieving this for most children. Some may still be at higher risk for worse outcomes, however — if a child has serious underlying medical conditions, for example, is on chemotherapy or is a transplant recipient. A booster dose would be advisable in these circumstances.\n\nSecond, is it very important for you to avoid Covid-19 infection in your children? Many families have decided that once their kids are vaccinated, if the risk of severe illness is very low, they do not prioritize eliminating Covid-19 infection.\n\nOn the other hand, others remain very vigilant and cautious. Perhaps they are concerned about the unknowns around long Covid. Perhaps they want to avoid their kids being sick, leading to missed school days and work days for caregivers. Or perhaps there is another household member to protect, such as an elderly grandparent or someone else with chronic underlying conditions. All of these are reasonable considerations for getting kids the booster sooner than later.\n\nThose age 5 and older can get the bivalent Covid-19 booster if they've received a primary vaccine series, the CDC said. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nOne thing I’ll caution is that we don’t know how long the booster will be effective in reducing symptomatic infection. Some studies have shown that the effectiveness of the primary vaccine against symptomatic infection may wane within a few months. That said, a lot can happen with Covid-19. We could see rising cases this fall and winter. There could be a new variant that becomes dominant. Many parents may want to get their kids optimal protection in case of another surge, and then decide again next year if another booster is needed.\n\nCNN: Are there circumstances that might prompt families to wait to boost their kids?\n\nWen: If a child has just had Covid-19, I think it’s advisable to wait at least three months, as the CDC recommends before boosting. Reinfection is unlikely in this time period, and it might be beneficial to allow the body time to develop its own immune response.\n\nThe same goes with a previous vaccine. The CDC says that children and adults can get the updated booster as long as it’s been at least two months since their last vaccine shot.\n\nI think these are both minimum intervals. Many experts, including me, believe that there is benefit to waiting longer — perhaps four to six months — after infection or last vaccination. That longer time period can allow the body to develop improved immunity before another boost, as some studies have suggested. However, I also understand and appreciate the CDC’s need to have streamlined guidance, and it’s reasonable to follow their guidelines as stated.\n\nCNN: Is there any downside to giving kids the booster?\n\nWen: This is an important question to ask. The way that I’d answer is to clarify that every intervention — including vaccines — has upsides and potential downsides. Parents and families will weigh the upsides and downsides differently. The evidence is very clear that for the initial vaccines, the upsides far outweigh any potential risk. The evidence is less clear for boosters.\n\nIn the case of a child with serious underlying medical conditions, for example, there is a significant upside to getting the booster to prevent severe outcomes due to Covid-19. For other children, especially for younger children under 12, the initial vaccines are probably still very protective, and it’s not yet clear what the added benefit of the booster is in reducing the risk of hospitalization.\n\nThere are some common side effects to Covid-19 vaccines. The vast majority are benign and self-resolving; symptoms like body aches, fatigue, fever, and soreness around the site of the booster jab usually go away in a couple of days. (There are very rare cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle most often seen in the adolescent male. These, too, tend to resolve on their own and do not cause long-term effects.) Broadly speaking, these should not be a major consideration for parents.\n\nThe CDC has recommended the booster, and I think it’s reasonable for parents who wish to follow the guidance to do so. For those on the fence, having a frank conversation with your pediatrician about your family’s specific circumstances can also guide you in your decision.\n\nCNN: What about children who just turned 5 — should they get the new booster?\n\nWen: I have a son who recently turned 5, and received his primary series when he was 4. His last shot was in July. I am not planning to give him the booster yet. I’m waiting at least six months for the reasons mentioned above.\n\nCNN: Can parents and caregivers choose to give their kids a dose of the original booster?\n\nWen: No. The US Food and Drug Administration has withdrawn its authorization for the original monovalent vaccine and replaced it with the updated bivalent booster. That means you can only receive the updated booster. That applies to children as well as adults.\n\nCNN: If a child has not been vaccinated yet, are they eligible for the updated booster?\n\nWen: No. Children who have not yet been vaccinated can only receive the original vaccine for their primary series. Parents who wish for their kids to get the updated bivalent vaccine have to complete the primary series — two doses of Pfizer or Moderna — and then get the updated booster.\n\nI want to emphasize the importance of the primary series. Numerous studies have found that the first two doses are highly protective against severe illness, including in kids. In one New England Journal of Medicine study, the first two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines reduced hospitalization among children by more than 80%. This should be a call to action for families who have not yet gotten their kids any Covid-19 vaccines to get them the initial vaccination.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/health/thanksgiving-updated-covid-booster/index.html", "title": "Thanksgiving is two weeks away. Get your updated Covid-19 shot ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith Thanksgiving just two weeks away, people who are eligible for an updated Covid-19 vaccine booster but still haven’t received the shot will need to roll up their sleeves Thursday to get as much protection as possible before the holiday.\n\nHealth officials are worried about a possible surge in respiratory illnesses this winter – including Covid-19, flu, RSV and rhinoviruses – and they are urging people who are not up-to-date on their Covid-19 shots to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n“The way it makes protection is to create these proteins, which we call antibodies, that then circulate in the bloodstream. Well, that can’t be done with a snap of the finger. There’s a biological process that takes place,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nAfter getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine, that biological process can take about 10 to 14 days.\n\n“So it starts right away, and gradually you get more and more of these antibodies into your bloodstream until, by about two weeks, you’re close to having a maximum,” Schaffner said. “The booster actually functions as a booster: You get an increase in antibody that’s faster than if you started from scratch.”\n\nThe rollout of the updated boosters has been sluggish, and there’s some urgency to building protection before gathering with family and friends for the holidays – the first festive season of the pandemic since most prevention measures, including masks and social distancing, largely became things of the past.\n\nIn October, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine is “the most important thing” Americans can do for their health right now.\n\n“The most important thing every American can do to reduce their likelihood of having significant, preventable health issues in the next three to six months is to go get an updated Covid vaccine,” Jha said. “Beyond that, we need to make sure that everyone over the age of 50 or otherwise with high-risk conditions gets treatments if they do get infected. We have treatments widely available.”\n\nAs colder weather arrives, people spend more time indoors and more holiday celebrations are planned, concern mounts among local health officials that there will be some uptick in the spread of Covid-19, flu and RSV in the weeks ahead, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nThat concern is heightened even more because relatively few people across the United States have gotten the updated Covid-19 vaccine booster that is now available for those 5 and older.\n\n“The message from the local health departments on this is that you should by now – if you are eligible and able – be getting your booster to protect you through the holidays,” Freeman said.\n\n“The longer that time goes on since you’ve received your last booster, the more that your immunity wanes and the more susceptible you become again to getting sick with the virus,” she said. “So all those things together spell out that we have prevention to do right now as we get ready for the end of the year and the holiday season upon us.”\n\nLess than 10% of the US population – about 26 million people 5 and older – has gotten an updated Covid-19 booster dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coverage is highest among older adults: More than 1 in 5 seniors who got their primary series have also gotten an updated booster, compared with about 1 in 15 adults under the age of 30.\n\nBut the pace of uptake is relatively slow.\n\nAbout 1 in 5 adults who have their primary series say they will probably or definitely not get the updated booster – a share that has been consistent since at least September, CDC data shows.\n\n“What clearly will happen if we still don’t have widespread acceptance of this Covid booster is that the anticipated increase that we expect with Covid this winter will increase even more,” Schaffner said. “So we could make the season worse from the point of view of more serious disease.”\n\nHe added that with rising flu activity, an ongoing surge in RSV and the growing concerns around a possible increase in Covid-19 this winter, that is why it will be important to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and flu ahead of the holidays – and to make sure those around you will be vaccinated, washing their hands and staying home when sick.\n\n“You could have a rule: You’re all welcome at the Thanksgiving table, for example, if you’re vaccinated and not only against Covid, against influenza, too,” Schaffner said.\n\nHealth officials say it’s fine to get the updated Covid-19 booster and flu vaccine at the same time.\n\nFlu activity continues to ramp up\n\nFlu is already spreading at high levels in some areas.\n\nLast week, government health officials warned of an early and severe start to cold and flu season in the United States, saying they were closely monitoring hospital capacity and medical supplies and were ready to send help if needed.\n\n“We suspect that many children are being exposed to some respiratory viruses now for the first time, having avoided these viruses during the height of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jose Romero, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nAcross the United States, cases of RSV and influenza are increasing. At the same time, Covid-19 cases, which had been dropping, appear to have plateaued over the past three weeks, Romero said. A raft of new variants has been gaining ground against BA.5, the Omicron subvariant that caused a wave of illness over the summer.\n\nLooking ahead, some vaccine makers, including Novavax and Pfizer and BioNTech, are developing two-in-one combination vaccines that will offer protection against both flu and Covid-19 in a single shot.\n\nLast week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the first study participant has received a dose of their investigational flu-Covid combination vaccine in a Phase 1 trial. The vaccine candidate contains components of the companies’ updated Covid-19 booster and their investigational flu vaccine.\n\nIn October, Novavax announced that its Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine generated immune responses against coronavirus and influenza strains, showing “positive results” in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. That trial is “the first of its kind” to evaluate a Covid-flu combination vaccine, the company said, and insights from the trial will inform a Phase 2 study that’s expected to start by the end of this year. The investigational vaccine is a two-in-one combination of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine and its quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate.\n\nModerna is also developing a combined flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and another combination vaccine targeting flu, Covid-19 and RSV.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHealth officials have long suspected that Covid-19 vaccinations will be needed annually in the future, similar to how seasonal flu vaccines are given each year.\n\nA combination vaccine could be available as soon as for the next flu season, Freeman said, making it easier for people to roll up their sleeves on an annual basis.\n\n“We may see as early as next year,” she said. “And that will help make it easier for people to make that choice to get both their flu and Covid either together in one vaccine or together at once wherever they’re able to get their vaccine.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/health/covid-omicron-booster-explainer-wellness/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 vaccine: Everything you need to know about the Omicron ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s a new kind of Covid-19 shot coming to a pharmacy or clinic near you.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on updated boosters that target the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.\n\nHow are these new bivalent vaccines different?\n\nThe new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.\n\n“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”\n\nHaving twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.\n\n“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.\n\nPfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It’s authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.\n\nMillions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.\n\nCVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots. Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.\n\n“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.\n\nAs with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.\n\nAmericans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.\n\nExperts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.\n\n“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nAdults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.\n\nYou should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.\n\nFor those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious. For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started. Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.\n\nYou may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.\n\n“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.\n\nUS health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations. This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.\n\nThe government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nOne vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance. The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nThe CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nChildren ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now. Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\nUntil those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.\n\nYes, but that’s not all. If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld. Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.\n\nEvusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up. It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free. The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.\n\nIf you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it. But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.\n\nA recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.\n\nVery rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men.\n\nThe highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.\n\n“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.\n\nThe evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.\n\nThe FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway. FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.\n\nOfficials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.\n\n“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”\n\nOffit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.\n\n“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’ I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’ We’re extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.\n\nFDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence.\n\nThe first is the vaccines’ track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.\n\nThe second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.\n\nEarlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.\n\nThe BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n“It’s fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. … It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.\n\n“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. “I’m very confident about this.”\n\nIn the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.\n\nIn a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.\n\nThey found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.\n\nVariant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.\n\nAs the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.\n\nThe hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.\n\nThere is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.\n\nAmong the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months.\n\nSo there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/18/health/cdc-covid-vaccine-children-under-5/index.html", "title": "CDC recommends Covid-19 vaccines for children as young as 6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on Covid-19 vaccinations for children under 5 on Saturday, clearing the way for vaccinations to be administered soon.\n\nThis move comes after vaccine advisers to the CDC voted unanimously on Saturday in support of recommending the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to children as young as 6 months.\n\n“Together, with science leading the charge, we have taken another important step forward in our nation’s fight against COVID-19. We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated, and with today’s decision, they can,” Walensky said in a statement. “I encourage parents and caregivers with questions to talk to their doctor, nurse, or local pharmacist to learn more about the benefits of vaccinations and the importance of protecting their children by getting them vaccinated.”\n\nVaccinations may not begin until Tuesday in some places.\n\nPresident Joe Biden praised the CDC’s decision to recommend the vaccines on Saturday.\n\n“Today is a monumental step forward in our nation’s fight against the virus, with virtually every American now eligible for the protections that COVID-19 vaccines provide,” Biden said in a written statement, adding: “For parents all over the country, this is a day of relief and celebration.”\n\nWalensky signed off on the administration of two doses of Moderna’s vaccine in children ages six months to 5 years, and three doses of Pfizer’s vaccine in children ages six months to 4 years. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) noted on Saturday that if any Pfizer vaccine is given, then the vaccination series needs to contain three doses.\n\n“We’ll be monitoring inventory as the vaccines are delivered starting Monday to clinics, pharmacies and other clinical settings to determine when the search for the under-five vaccines will be available on vaccines.gov,” Dr. Kevin Chatham-Stephens, the Pediatric Vaccine Planning and Implementation Lead with the CDC’s Vaccine Task Force, said in ACIP’s meeting.\n\n“Parents and caregivers can reach out to the child’s pediatrician or family practice doctor or a local health department, pharmacy, et cetera to ask if they have the vaccine, understanding that not every clinic or pharmacy will get their vaccine on Monday.”\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for young children\n\nOn Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorizations for Moderna’s vaccine to include children 6 months through 17 years and Pfizer/BioNTech’s for children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nThe CDC’s vaccine advisers will be discussing use of the Moderna vaccine in older children ages 6 to 17 years of age at their meeting June 23.\n\nAbout 17 million kids under the age of 5 are now are eligible for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nCovid-19 is the leading cause of infectious disease-related death in people up to 19 years old, but data shows that those deaths can be prevented through vaccination, Dr. Matthew Daley said in Friday’s ACIP meeting.\n\n“Covid-19 is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases for people ages 0 to 19 years. And Covid-19 is the seventh most common of all causes of death for people ages 0 to 19 years,” Daley, senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, told the committee.\n\n“Through March of 2022, unvaccinated people 5 years of age and older had 10 times the risk of dying from Covid-19 compared to those vaccinated with at least the primary series,” Daley said, adding that in other words, the data “provide real-world evidence that most deaths from Covid-19 are preventable through vaccination.”\n\nIn Saturday’s ACIP meeting, Dr. Veronica McNally said she was “struck” by the impact Covid-19 has had on children.\n\n“I am struck by these numbers: 2 million cases, 20,000 hospitalizations and over 200 deaths. And I am also concerned that there’s really an underappreciation for the potential severity of a respiratory virus in kids in this age and an unclear understanding sometimes in parents about the long-term consequences, including MIS-C,” McNally said.\n\nWill the youngest children get vaccinated?\n\nMany public health experts worry that even though the Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for younger age groups, parents of these children might not take their kids to get them.\n\n“The hard work only continues,” after recommending the vaccine, Daley said, citing the importance of communicating to parents “how vitally important these vaccines are to protect children’s lives.”\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in children.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said Wednesday.\n\nBarouch, who is not involved in the FDA’s or CDC’s decisions, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November. But just 29% of these children are fully vaccinated with their two-dose primary series in the United States, according to the CDC, compared with about:\n\n60% of adolescents 12 to 17\n\n64% of adults 18 to 24\n\n67% of adults 25 to 39\n\n75% of adults 40 to 49\n\n82% of adults 50 to 64\n\n94% of adults 65 to 74\n\n88% of adults 75 and older\n\n“We are planning and preparing for the rollout of pediatric vaccines. Of course, there’s a lot of work to be done to look at uptake of this vaccine. Some of the polls and surveys that have gone out to the public have indicated an ongoing lessening of parents considering giving their children these vaccines over time,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nAccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation’s Vaccine Monitor survey published in May, only 18% of parents of children under 5 said they would vaccinate their child against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine was available.\n\n“I think the more the pandemic is in the rearview mirror for some people – or they believe it is – then the less compelled they will be to do this, and so we have a big public health education campaign ahead of us,” Freeman said. “Also, health departments at the local level will be looking to understand the landscape of their community in terms of how many providers, pediatricians and pharmacies have actually signed up to give out the vaccine.”\n\nPediatrics groups support ACIP’s recommendation\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) both released statements Saturday in support of a vote to recommend Covid-19 vaccines in children as young as six months.\n\nSpeaking in the CDC meeting on Saturday, Dr. Bonnie Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said it would be important to focus distribution equitably.\n\n“As of June 8, 23 million children ages five to 17 have received two doses of Covid vaccine. But another 26 million in this age group have yet to receive any doses. Our work is cut out for us. We must also all work together to reduce disparities and address barriers to vaccination in every community so that all children and families can benefit from the protection of these vaccines,” she said.\n\nPatsy Stinchfield, with NAPNAP, also spoke in support of the recommendation but asked ACIP to stress the importance of vaccination in this age group.\n\n“I was a bit dismayed with some of the headlines coming out after the VRBPAC decision emphasizing quote, it’s up to the parents. This can be misinterpreted to consider this vaccine in young children as optional. We don’t say to parents of a baby with a cardiac defect, ‘it’s up to you for your child to have open heart surgery.’ We say, ‘your child needs open heart surgery’,” she said.\n\n“We don’t get out of pandemics with ‘it’s-up-to-you’-type strategies,” she said.\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\nUnder the FDA’s authorization, the Moderna vaccine can be given as a two-dose primary series, at 25 micrograms each dose, to infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age. For older children, ages 6 to 11, the doses are 50 micrograms each.\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine now can be given as a three-dose primary series, at 3 micrograms each dose, for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, a vaccine adviser to the FDA, said Wednesday that children who get the Pfizer vaccine will have to complete a three-dose series to get sufficient protection.\n\n” ‘Do the benefits outweigh the risks’ is something I can support, but I do have some concerns about this vaccine,” said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Jeannette Lee of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who also serves on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, agreed.\n\n“Three doses will certainly benefit. I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get a third dose,” she said. “My concern is that you have to get the three doses to really get what you need.”\n\nAccording to clinical trial data, common side effects for both vaccines include pain at the injection site, headache, fever, chills and fatigue. The vaccines appeared to elicit similar immune responses in children as has been seen in adults.\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee determined that the benefits of both vaccines outweigh the risks and noted that the vaccines have been “well-tolerated” among the children who got them in clinical trials.\n\n“The benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks, particularly for those with young children who may be in kindergarten or in collective child care,” committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a discussion about the Moderna vaccine.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in children is concerning and much higher when compared with influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\n“There still was, during the Omicron wave, a relatively high rate of hospitalization during this period,” he said. “That rate of hospitalization actually is quite troubling, and if we compare this to what we see in a terrible influenza season, it is worse.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMarks said the number of deaths for children 4 and under during the first two years of the pandemic “also compares quite terribly to what we’ve seen with influenza in the past.”\n\n“We are dealing with an issue where I think we have to be careful that we don’t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here. Every life is important,” he said, adding that “vaccine-preventable deaths are ones we would like to try to do something about.”\n\nHe added that the Covid-19 vaccines are an intervention similar to the influenza vaccine, which has been broadly and routinely used and accepted to prevent deaths in all ages.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard", "The Moderna", "Pfizer Biontech Vaccines Are Now Authorized For Young Children"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}]}

PFAS can also be found in the ink used to print logos and instructions on food containers.\n\nThe new report comes more than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic, when the public has relied heavily on takeout and grocery deliveries.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) a “public health concern,” citing studies that found the human-made chemicals can harm the immune system and reduce a person’s resistance to infectious diseases.\n\n“There is evidence from human and animal studies that PFAS exposure may reduce antibody responses to vaccines,” stated the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. “More research is needed to understand how PFAS exposure may affect illness from COVID-19.”\n\nMore than 100 food products tested\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation collected 118 food packaging products sold by 24 companies in the tristate area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It tested those products for organic fluorine – a marker for PFAS. Researchers then sent samples of products with the highest levels to an independent laboratory that could perform more specific tests, said Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist for advocacy at Consumer Reports.\n\nRegulatory limits for how much PFAS food packaging should contain can vary greatly. In the US, there are no federal limits, leaving action up to the states. Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington have passed bills banning intentional use of PFAS in food packaging, but haven’t yet specified a limit, according to Consumer Reports. In January 2023, a new law in California will set the limit at less than 100 ppm (parts per million).\n\nHowever, Denmark set a much lower regulatory limit of 20 ppm with great success, said Xenia Trier, a chemicals, environment and human health expert at the European Environment Agency.\n\n“In Denmark we’ve seen both a decrease in noncompliance by industry from 60% to about 30% and a decrease in levels of PFAS in packaging products over the past 10 years,” Trier told CNN. “It does work to set limits and enforce them. It is possible to find alternative solutions and if one manufacturer can make packaging without PFAS, then it should be possible for everybody to do it.”\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation found the highest indicators for PFAS – 876 ppm and 618 ppm – in two types of bags for sides at Nathan’s Famous restaurants.\n\nHigh indicators of PFAS (in the 500s) were also found in a Chick-fil-A sandwich wrapper and in fiber bowls at Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant chain.\n\nIndicator levels in the 300s and 400s were found in a bag of cookies at Arby’s, bamboo paper plates at Stop & Shop, and in a bag for both cookies and French toast sticks at Burger King.\n\nLevels of PFAS indicators in the 200s were found in a Sweetgreen paper bag for focaccia, additional items at Cava, and in bags for french fries, cookies and Chicken McNuggets at McDonald’s.\n\nHowever, all of the companies listed had additional food packaging that tested at levels below 200 ppm. Four companies – Arby’s, Nathan’s Famous, McDonald’s and Stop & Shop – also sold food in packaging that had no detectable levels of PFAS, the report said.\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation did not test packaging from every food product sold at each company.\n\n“I would not urge consumers to take these brand names and only go to this one or that one, as this investigation only looked at just over 100 products,” said Graham Peaslee, a professor of physics, chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.\n\n“However, this will hold industry’s toes to the fire, so in that sense, I think it’s a valuable report,” he added. “Measuring and saying PFAS is there and it’s dangerous gets people’s attention, and companies tend to avoid attention like that.”\n\nHealth impact of PFAS\n\nPFAS chemicals are in many products: nonstick cookware, infection-resistant surgical gowns and drapes, cell phones, semiconductors, commercial aircraft and low-emission vehicles. The chemicals also are used to make carpeting, clothing, and furniture resistant to stains, water and grease damage.\n\nIn use since the 1950s, PFAS are chemicals most Americans have “in their blood,” especially perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),” according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is charged with protecting the public from hazardous substances.\n\nIn the Consumer Reports investigation, the most common chemical found in the food packaging that was tested was PFOA, with PFOS coming in fifth, according to the report.\n\nIn addition to impacts on the immune system, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry said studies in humans and lab animals have found links between certain PFAS chemicals and an increase in cholesterol levels, alterations in liver enzymes, a higher risk of developing kidney or testicular cancer, small reductions in infant birth weights and an additional risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women.\n\n“PFAS have also caused birth defects, delayed development, and newborn deaths in lab animals,” the agency stated, while adding “not all effects observed in animals may occur in humans.”\n\nAs environmental groups and the public began to take notice of the health impacts of the chemicals, manufacturers started to voluntarily phase out the use of PFOS and PFOA in the US. Between 1999 and 2014, blood levels of PFOS in Americans had declined by more than 80% and blood levels of PFOA had declined by more than 60%, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry stated.\n\nHowever, “as PFOS and PFOA are phased out and replaced, people may be exposed to other PFAS,” the agency continued. Newer versions of PFAS in food packaging appear to be absorbed by food more readily than the older versions, according to a 2016 study.\n\nStudies in Denmark have shown that PFAS do “migrate from the paper into the food,” Trier said. “Even though it was not 100%, we still saw substantial transmission. In general, transmission from packaging to food is increased as the temperature of the food rises and the time spent in wrapping materials increases.”\n\nIndustry response\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation mirrored results of reports in 2018 and 2020 by Toxic-Free Future and Safer Chemicals Healthy Families. Those reports found “harmful” levels of PFAS in fast-food packaging and in nearly two-thirds of takeout containers made of paper, like those used at self-serve salad buffets and hot bars.\n\nIn response to the 2018 report, Whole Foods became the first grocery chain in North America to publicly commit to remove PFAS from takeout containers and deli and bakery paper. Other companies have followed suit, including Ahold Delhaize, Albertsons, Amazon.com, Cava, Chipotle, Freshii, McDonald’s, Panera Bread, Sweetgreen, Trader Joe’s and Wendy’s, according to Toxic-Free Future.\n\nIn the new investigation, Consumer Reports tested 13 food packaging products from retailers that had previously committed to phasing out PFAS. Seven of the 13 had levels of PFAS above 20 ppm, the report said.\n\nBurger King, which had high levels of PFAS in three of six products tested, had not made a public commitment to phase out PFAS, according to Consumer Reports. Early Thursday, parent company Restaurant Brands International announced it will globally phase out any “added” PFAS from “guest-facing packaging materials” at the Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes brands “by the end of 2025 or sooner.”\n\nNathan’s Famous, which Consumer Reports said also has not made a public commitment to reducing PFAS, told CNN the company had begun phasing out the bags. “One of our goals in this complete package redesign is to reduce PFAS,” said Phil McCann, vice president of marketing at Nathan’s Famous. “Full transition will be complete by December 2022.”\n\nChick-fil-A told CNN it had been on a four-year journey to phase out PFAS: “Chick-fil-A has eliminated intentionally added PFAS from all newly produced packaging going forward in our supply chain. While some legacy packaging may still be in restaurants, it is expected to be phased out by the end of this summer,” the company tweeted Wednesday.\n\nCava, which had previously pledged to reduce PFAS but had five out of six products with indicators between 200 ppm and 548 ppm, told CNN that “due to a multitude of factors related to the pandemic, and especially global supply chain shortages, the transition to eliminating added PFAS, which began in August of 2021, is taking longer than planned. Our teams are working with our suppliers to complete the transition within the year.”\n\nA McDonald’s spokesperson said less than 7.5% of the company’s global food packaging contained added PFAS at the end of 2020 and said the company was continuing its search for alternative materials that offered proper grease-resistant barriers, with a goal of reducing deliberately added PFAS by the end of 2025.\n\nSweetgreen told CNN the company was “proud to share that we are currently in the process of rolling out new PFAS-free focaccia bags that will be available in all Sweetgreen locations by the end of Q2.”\n\nJennifer Brogan, director of external communications and community relations for Stop & Shop, told CNN the company could “confirm that these Nature’s Promise brand plates have been removed from all store locations.”\n\nA spokesperson from Arby’s told CNN in an email that the company has “minimal packaging materials containing PFAs and is on track to have PFAs removed from all packaging products by the end of 2022.”\n\nActions the public can take\n\nExperts say people who want to avoid PFAS in their takeout and food delivery packaging should favor companies that have pledged to remove the chemicals.\n\nTake food out of the container as soon as you receive it, and never reheat food in its original container. Instead, remove your food and heat it in ceramic or glass containers, Trier said.\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation found some of the highest levels of PFAS were in paper bags (192.2 ppm) and molded fiber bowls and trays (156.8 ppm). Paper plates tested at 149 ppm, and food wrappers and liners came in at 59.2 ppm.\n\nDon’t be fooled by “environmentally friendly” claims – they don’t guarantee a product is PFAS-free. When Consumer Reports tested those products, some had levels of PFAS above 100 ppm, and most had some detectable levels, the report said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nExperts also suggest reducing the frequency of takeout meals to once a week or less, and recommend that people instead make food at home.\n\nYou can also reach out to your congressional representative and senators and support the bipartisan bill Keep Food Containers Safe from PFAS Act, experts said.

What to know after Skittles lawsuit", "text": "In a lawsuit filed last week, a consumer alleged that Skittles were \"unfit for human consumption\" because the rainbow candy contained a \"known toxin\" – an artificial color additive called titanium dioxide.\n\nIn a statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday, Justin Comes, vice president of research and development for Skittles maker Mars Wrigley North America, said the company couldn't comment on pending litigation – but that its use of titanium dioxide and \"all Mars Wrigley ingredients are safe and manufactured in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements established by food safety regulators, including the FDA.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in a wide range of food products and consumer goods – from candy to sunscreen and house paint. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide, specifically as a color additive in food, is safe under some restrictions.\n\nHowever, some experts and food regulators in other countries disagree – pointing to potential, serious health consequences and rising concerns about the additive. Starting August 7, for example, the use of titanium dioxide in food will be banned in the European Union.\n\nHere's what you need to know about titanium dioxide:\n\nCustomer sues Mars:Skittles are 'unsafe' for consumers, lawsuit charges, because they contain 'a known toxin'\n\nWhat is titanium dioxide? Why is it used in food products?\n\nTitanium dioxide, or TiO2, sometimes referred to as E171, is an inorganic, solid substance used in a wide range of consumer goods including cosmetics, paint, plastic and food, according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\nIn food, titanium dioxide is often used as an artificial color additive. Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist at the consumer health nonprofit Environmental Working Group, says titanium dioxide can generally be thought of as a \"paint primer\" – it often goes on a hard-shelled candy like Skittles before the color is added to give it a \"uniform shine.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide \"can also be found in dairy products to make them whiter and brighter … like frosting or cottage cheese,\" Stoiber told USA TODAY, adding that the additive is used in other products – such as food or beverage instant mixes – as an anti-caking agent.\n\nPhthalates on the fast-food menu:Chemicals linked to health problems found at McDonalds, Taco Bell\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in an enormous range of food products, which can feel jarring when looking at some of its other uses.\n\n\"It's sort of ironic, maybe ironic is the wrong word, that the ingredient in paint that makes your kitchen shiny also makes your Hostess cupcakes shiny,\" Environmental Working Group's senior vice president of government affairs Scott Faber added.\n\nIs titanium dioxide dangerous? Has it been linked to any health issues?\n\nWhile the FDA maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide is safe, the European Food Safety Authority and some other experts warn of potential, serious health risks.\n\nMost notably, a European Food Safety Authority safety assessment published in May 2021 pointed to genotoxicity concerns, as suggested by previous research. Genotoxicity is the ability of chemicals to damage genetic information such as DNA, which may lead to cancer.\n\n\"After oral ingestion, the absorption of titanium dioxide particles is low, however they can accumulate in the body,\" Maged Younes, chair of the European Food Safety Authority's expert Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings, said in a May 2021 statement.\n\nCan cancer patients skip post-surgery chemo? New research says some may be able to.\n\nThe authority did not identify a safe amount of titanium dioxide that could be consumed.\n\nMatthew Wright, chair of the authority's working group on titanium dioxide, noted that \"the evidence for general toxic effects was not conclusive,\" but that the panel couldn't rule out genotoxicity entirely. There were also some current data limitations and the assessment \"could not establish a safe level for daily intake of the food additive,\" he stated.\n\nWhat other candies and food contain titanium dioxide?\n\nIt's hard to determine the total amount of food products that have titanium dioxide because federal regulations don't require all producers to list its use on ingredient labels, but the list of foods containing the substance certainly doesn't end with Skittles.\n\nOf the products that include the additive in their labels, Thea Bourianne, senior manager at data consultant Label Insights, told Food Navigator USA in May 2021 that more than 11,000 products in the company's database of U.S. food and beverage products listed titanium dioxide as an ingredient. Non-chocolate candy led those numbers at 32%. Cupcakes and snack cakes made up 14%, followed by cookies at 8%, coated pretzels and trail mix at 7%, baking decorations at 6%, gum and mints at 4% and ice cream at 2%.\n\nFood recalls:Some Jif peanut butter products recalled over salmonella outbreak concerns\n\nIn addition to Skittles, other candies that contain titanium dioxide include Nice! mints, Trolli sour gummies and Ring Pops, according to Environmental Working Group.\n\nOther food products that list titanium dioxide are Lucerne cottage cheese, Beyond Meat's chicken plant-based tenders, Great Value ice cream and Chips Ahoy! cookies.\n\nWhat is the FDA limit for titanium dioxide?\n\nThe FDA's Code of Federal Regulations allows for the legal, regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products, under some restrictions.\n\n\"The FDA continues to allow for the safe use of titanium dioxide as a color additive in foods generally according to the specifications and conditions, including that the quantity of titanium dioxide does not exceed 1% by weight of the food,\" the FDA said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThe FDA first approved the use of titanium dioxide in food in 1966, following its 1960 removal (along with the removal of other color additives) from the agency's original \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" list. In 1977, titanium dioxide joined the list of color additives that are exempt from certification, which means \"titanium dioxide\" doesn't have to be listed on the packaging of every product it's used in, Faber noted.\n\n\"There are many uses of titanium dioxide that we don't know about because they were made exempt from being on the package in 1977,\" said Faber, who added that \"nothing much has changed\" since – other than the FDA approving some other uses of the color additive, such as expanding the use of mica-based pearlescent pigments (prepared from titanium dioxide) as color additives in distilled spirits over recent years.\n\nFDA guidelines:Americans are eating too much salt. So the FDA wants food manufacturers to cut back on sodium.\n\nFaber argued there hasn't been enough change in these federal regulations in the decades following the FDA's approval of titanium dioxide – especially as others increasingly point to potential health consequences.\n\n\"What titanium dioxide is really emblematic of ... is the failure of FDA to look back at these old decisions and ask whether its decisions that were made in this case ... 56 years ago (in the 1966 approval) still hold up,\" he said.\n\nIn its statement to USA TODAY, the FDA maintained that, in all post-approvals for food additives, \"our scientists continue to review relevant new information to determine whether there are safety questions and whether the use of such substance is no longer safe under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\"\n\nWhen asked about the recent Skittles lawsuit, the FDA said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nIs titanium dioxide illegal in other countries?\n\nThough the regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products is legal in the U.S. and Canada, it's banned in some other countries, notably throughout Europe. In May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority announced that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered safe as a food additive.\"\n\nFollowing six months of phasing out the additive, titanium dioxide will be completely banned in the European Union starting August 7. France had previously banned the use of titanium dioxide in food starting in January 2020.\n\nHow can I tell if a product has titanium dioxide in it? How can I avoid the ingredient?\n\nSome food products will include titanium dioxide on their nutrition label. But again, it can be hard to tell for those who don't list the ingredient.\n\nIf you want to avoid titanium dioxide, Stoiber and Faber urge consumers to try and avoid processed foods as best as you can.\n\n\"By reducing processed foods in your diet, you can reduce the likelihood of not only eating titanium dioxide but eating other chemicals of concern,\" Faber said, noting that consumers can also call their elected representatives urging them to support increased food safety legislation and take action with organization alliances like Toxic Free Food FDA. \"America, once again, is falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to chemical safety.\"\n\n\"We're not only just concerned about titanium dioxide, there's a whole host of other food additives that also have known harmful health risks associated with them as well,\" Stoiber added.\n\nHealthy eating:Don't focus on 'good' or 'bad' food.

These PFAS chemicals have been detected in the blood of 99% of Americans, according to a 2015 report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThousands of varieties of PFAS are used in many of the products we purchase, including nonstick cookware, infection-resistant surgical gowns and drapes, mobile phones, semiconductors, commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles.\n\nThe chemicals are also used to make carpeting, clothing, furniture and food packaging resistant to stains, water and grease damage. Once treated, the report said, textiles emit PFAS over the course of their lifetimes, escaping into the air and water in homes and communities.\n\nThe report did have some good news for consumers, Schreder said.\n\n“We didn’t find PFAS in any of the items that were not marketed as stain or water-resistant,” Schreder said. “Consumers can just choose those to be safe.”\n\nRaincoats, of course, are a different story, because consumers need them to be rain-repellent. But there is a rainbow here as well, Schreder added. To accomplish the goal of repelling water, a few companies are using tighter weaves, PFAS-free membranes between coat layers, and “paraffin wax, which is the only coating that has been publicly assessed and found to be safer.”\n\nBanned PFAS still found\n\nOver the last decade, American chemical manufacturers have voluntarily stopped producing two heavily studied PFAS substances that have been linked to cancer, heart disease, immune and endocrine disorders, and more: the eight-carbon chain perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS).\n\nHowever, testing by Toxic-Free Future found 74% of the imported products still contained the older PFAS chemicals.\n\n“I was alarmed that the older, longer PFAS chains, touted by industry as having been phased out, were found in these imported products,” said Melanie Benesh, a legislative and regulatory lawyer for the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy group dedicated to reforming chemical safety and agricultural laws. Neither Benesh nor EWG were involved with the report.\n\nA spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, an industry trade organization, told CNN that importation could explain why “legacy chemistries that have been phased out were identified and could indicate a greater need for control over imported products.”\n\nNewer chemicals found\n\nThe report said product testing also found a number of newer PFAS chemicals created by industry to take the place of PFOA and PFOS. Experts say the new versions, which simply replace the eight-carbon chain with four- or six-carbon chains, appear to have many of the dangerous health effects as the older chemicals. Thus, experts say, consumers and the environment are still at risk.\n\n“They went to the shorter chain carbons, and you study them, and they do just about the same thing,” microbiologist Linda Birnbaum, the former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, told CNN in a prior interview.\n\n“Some people call it the ‘Whac-a-Mole’ problem. Others call it the chemical conveyor belt,” Birnbaum said. “Why would we think that you can make a very minor change in a molecule you are manufacturing and the body wouldn’t react in the same way?”\n\nThe American Chemistry Council took issue with the report’s findings, saying not all PFAS are equal and should not be regulated in the the same manner.\n\n“Lumping all PFAS together as if they are the same is at odds with mainstream science,” said Tom Flanagin, director of product communications for the American Chemistry Council, in an email. “Consumers need to be wary of reports that use flawed assumptions unsupported by the science.”\n\nGood news for consumers\n\nThere are an increasing number of ways consumer can avoid clothing and other products laced with PFAS, experts say. One of the most effective: voting with your pocketbook.\n\n“The easiest thing a consumer can do is don’t buy things that are marketed as stain- and water-resistant,” EWG’s Benesh said. “When it comes to clothing you want to be more waterproof, I think you’d have to do your research with the retailer to see which products are actually PFAS-free.”\n\nThere are lists of companies which are PFAS-free – or at least are in the process of becoming so, experts say. The Environmental Working Group has curated a list of companies who have not intentionally added PFAS to their products.\n\nConsumers can also check the list of GreenScreen Certified products, which is a “globally recognized tool designed to assess and benchmark chemicals based on hazard,” said Shari Franjevic, the GreenScreen program manager for Clean Production Action, an organization dedicated to assessing green chemicals, sustainable materials and environmentally preferable products.\n\n“The key value of GreenScreen is that it takes really complex toxicology and distills it down to a score between one and four in harm (with four being the safest). That allows people to place chemicals on a continuum and say, ‘OK, this is safer than that,’ and begin to select safer chemicals for their products.”\n\nYou still may need to read labels, however. That’s because not every item in a company’s portfolio may yet be free of toxic chemicals, while legacy products being phased out may still be on the shelves in stores.\n\nReading a label may be tougher than you think, considering the alphabet soup of initials used to name various PFAS chemicals. Here are just a few:\n\nPFBA\n\nPFPeA\n\nPFHxA\n\nPFUdA\n\nPFDoA\n\nPFTrDA\n\nPFHpA\n\nPFTeDA\n\nPFNA\n\nPFDA\n\nPFHxDA\n\nPFODA.\n\nThat list doesn’t include the two legacy chemicals being phased out: PFOA and PFOS.\n\n“The most common way companies mislead is that they’ll say it’s PFOA-free, even though other PFAS’s have been used in the product,” said Scott Faber, EWG’s senior vice president for government affairs.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGoing to the trouble to do your research is worth it, said GreenScreen’s Franjevic, because there are many other problematic chemicals in our lives than PFAS.\n\n“One of the things we’re trying to educate the public on is just because it’s PFAS-free doesn’t mean it’s safer,” Franjevic said. “We are really encouraging people to understand that you want PFAS-free and what we call ‘preferred chemistry’ – products made without other carcinogens or mutagens or reproductive toxins.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/09/skittle-ban-california-law-additives/71116657007/", "title": "New California law won't ban Skittles, but could change food additives", "text": "California became the first state in the nation to ban the use of four food additives commonly found in thousands of products across the United States, including cereals, sodas and candies.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed the law misleadingly known as the \"Skittles ban,\" which will prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye 3. The four chemicals are used in as many as 12,000 food products across the country despite never having been approved for consumption by the Food and Drug Administration, according to the Environmental Working Group.\n\nAdvocates have long expressed concerns about the potential health problems that can be caused by eating products containing the additives, which other countries have already banned.\n\nIn a signing message, Newsom said the law is a \"positive step forward\" until the FDA reviews and establishes national regulations on the use of the four additives. The law takes effect in 2027 to give companies time to revise their recipes to exclude the \"harmful chemicals,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"Californians trust that the food products they consume are safe,\" Newsom said in his statement. \"I appreciate the author and stakeholders for working on amendments, which advance our shared public health objectives while maintaining consumer choice.\"\n\nPresidential debates:How to watch GOP candidates debate during Exeter Town Hall presidential forums\n\nHealth concerns prompt opposition to additives in food\n\nMost chemicals added to food and packaging are meant to enhance flavor or appearance or are simply to preserve freshness.\n\nWhile most are safe to eat, Consumer Reports and other advocacy groups say the four food chemicals included in the California Food Safety Act have been linked to a number of serious health concerns. Red Dye 3, for instance, has been found to cause cancer in animals, although there is not enough research linking the additive to cancer in humans.\n\nBut the use of Red Dye 3 − banned from cosmetics in the U.S. since 1990 − in food has elicited opposition nonetheless.\n\nConsumer Reports, an advocacy and research nonprofit, earlier this year called on the maker of Peeps candies to stop using Red Dye 3 in its products. Additionally, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer food safety organization, was among 24 groups and scientists that joined Consumer Reports in starting a petition last fall calling on the FDA to formally remove Red Dye 3 from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines.\n\nThe chemicals banned by the California Food Safety Act haven’t been reviewed by the FDA for 30 to 50 years, if ever, according to Consumer Reports, which co-sponsored the bill with the Environmental Working Group.\n\n“We’ve known for years that the toxic chemicals banned under California’s landmark new law pose serious risks to our health,” Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. “California has taken an important stand for food safety at a time when the FDA has failed to take action.\"\n\nCalifornia law became known as the 'Skittles ban'\n\nThe legislation became known as the \"Skittles ban\" because an earlier version also targeted titanium dioxide, a coloring agent found in candies including Skittles and M&Ms, as well as some dairy products such as Kraft fat-free shredded cheddar cheese.\n\nLast year, a California man sued Skittles manufacturer Mars Inc., saying the candy is \"unfit for human consumption\" because it contains the substance. Mention of titanium dioxide was removed, however, when the legislation was amended in September.\n\nDemocrat Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, who wrote AB 418, praised the bill's passage into law as \"a huge step in our effort to protect children and families in California from dangerous and toxic chemicals in our food supply.”\n\n“It’s unacceptable that the U.S. is so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to food safety,\" Gabrial said in a joint statement with Consumer Reports. \"This bill will not ban any foods or products − it simply will require food companies to make minor modifications to their recipes and switch to safer alternative ingredients that they already use in Europe and so many other places around the globe.\"\n\nBut not all were happy about Newsom's decision to sign the bill, which will impose fines of up to $10,000 for violations.\n\nAssociations representing business interests have for months opposed the restrictions. And after it became law, the National Confectioners Association released a statement accusing California lawmakers of \"once again making decisions based on soundbites rather than science.\"\n\n\"Governor Newsom’s approval of this bill will undermine consumer confidence and create confusion around food safety,\" the statement read. \"This law replaces a uniform national food safety system with a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements created by legislative fiat that will increase food costs.\"\n\nOther California news:Starbucks announces seven store closures in San Francisco. Critics question why\n\nLaw could affect consumers across the country − not just Californians\n\nAdvocacy groups say the law probably will change how manufacturers produce products in not just California, but across the nation.\n\n\"Given the size of the state’s economy, it is unlikely manufacturers will produce two versions of their product − one to be sold in California and one for the rest of the country,\" according to Consumer Reports.\n\nMeanwhile, other states have already started to follow California’s lead. A similar bill making its way through committee in the New York legislature also seeks to ban the same four chemicals, along with titanium dioxide.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group has signed two petitions being considered by the FDA that would be a blanket ban on the use of titanium dioxide and Red Dye No. 3 in food.\n\n“These petitions offer the FDA a chance to step up to the plate and do its job to protect Americans from toxic food chemicals,” Scott Faber, the group's senior vice president for government affairs said in a statement. “We urge the FDA to take action on these petitions and protect the health of all consumers across the country.\"\n\nColumbus Day:Is commemorating Columbus Day offensive? Why the day's namesake is disrespectful to some\n\nEuropean regulators have already largely banned additives\n\nAll four additives have already been banned by European regulators, with the narrow exception of Red Dye 3 in candied cherries, according to Consumer Reports.\n\nThe European Union's ban came in 2008 after it launched a full review of the safety of all food additives.\n\nRebuking the misnomer of \"the Skittles ban\" for the law, Newsom pointed out in his statement that the popular candy continues to be sold in places like the European Union despite existing bans on a number of chemical additives and colorants.\n\n\"The food industry is capable of maintaining product lines while complying with different public health laws,\" Newsom said. \"Californians will still be able to access and enjoy their favorite food products, with greater confidence in the safety of such products.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The company must cease marketing and sales of the Juul vaping device and four types of liquid pods: Virginia tobacco flavored and menthol flavored pods with nicotine levels of 5% and 3%.\n\nThe agency said retailers should contact Juul with question about products they have on shelves or in their inventory. The sales and marketing ban does not restrict consumer possession or use of the popular devices; the agency does not enforce consumer use of vaping or other tobacco products.\n\nThe FDA has reviewed marketing applications from Juul and hundreds of other companies amid calls from anti-tobacco groups to crack down on products that led to a surge in youth vaping in the past decade. But advocates of these nicotine-delivering devices say they can help adult smokers kick the habit of smoking cigarettes or using other tobacco products.\n\n►Why did the FDA ban Juul?:What to know about the latest response to vaping concerns\n\nThe agency said Juul's application to continue selling its products lacked evidence that the chemicals used would be \"appropriate for the protection of public health.\" While the FDA said it has not received clinical information suggesting a hazard from using Juul's vaping device or liquid pods, the agency determined there is not enough evidence to \"assess the potential toxicological risks of using the JUUL products.\"\n\nAlso unknown are potential harms from mixing Juul's device or liquid pods with other manufacturer's vaping products, the agency said.\n\n“Today’s action is further progress on the FDA’s commitment to ensuring that all e-cigarette and electronic nicotine delivery system products currently being marketed to consumers meet our public health standards,” FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement.\n\nJoe Murillo, Juul Labs chief regulatory officer, said the company believes it provided enough evidence to meet the FDA's standards.\n\n“We respectfully disagree with the FDA’s findings and decision and continue to believe we have provided sufficient information and data based on high-quality research to address all issues raised by the agency,\" he said.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company intends to seek a stay and is \"exploring all of our options under the FDA’s regulations and the law,\" Murillo said. \"We remain committed to doing all in our power to continue serving the millions of American adult smokers who have successfully used our products to transition away from combustible cigarettes, which remain available on market shelves nationwide.”\n\nIn 2020, the FDA required all e-cigarette and vaping companies to submit applications to continue marketing products. The agency also banned fruit- and mint-flavored juice pods used in e-cigarettes and vaping products, a ban that did not apply to menthol and tobacco-flavored products.\n\nIn September, the FDA banned the sale of hundreds of thousands of vaping and electronic cigarette products but did not rule on Juul, which came under fire for its appeal to youth vapers.\n\nThe FDA's removal of Juul products, rejecting the company's application to continue selling its vaping device and menthol- and tobacco-flavored pods, is \"long overdue,\" said Erika Sward, the American Lung Association's national assistant vice president of advocacy.\n\n\"Juul is largely responsible for the youth vaping epidemic,\" Sward said. \"No company and no product that has such blatant disregard for the health of our children and public health should be allowed to remain on the market.\"\n\nJohn Banzhaf III, a George Washington University professor of public interest law who has long sought tougher regulation of vaping devices, said Juul's marketing to kids likely influenced FDA's ban.\n\nJuul's \"promotion was directed to kids, and I think that's one of the reasons that the FDA went after them first,\" Banzhaf said. \"This is really the opening gun.

Usage is on the rise despite health risks ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

A guide to understanding chemicals behind ...", "text": "PFAS is an acronym for a family of chemicals called per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances that are celebrated for their use in nonstick cookware and water resistant clothing but also feared for their potential toxicity, which has been linked to types of cancer and other harmful effects.\n\nThese chemicals are synthetic and do not appear naturally in the environment. They were originally discovered in 1938, when a chemist working on refrigerants accidentally created a slippery, white substance that would later lead to the creation of the Teflon brand of nonstick pots and pans.\n\nAs of February 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency counted about 12,000 different kinds of PFAS. The common characteristic of all PFAS is that they include a carbon-fluorine molecule bond, one of the strongest known in chemistry. Other molecules cannot break between the carbon-fluorine bond, and instead slide off of surfaces treated with PFAS.\n\nThat same characteristic can also make PFAS harmful, as the chemicals are virtually indestructible and do not fully degrade in the environment or within living tissue. For that reason, they're often referred to as “forever chemicals.”\n\nRED F:Is EPA putting interests of chemical companies ahead of your health? These experts think so\n\nWhich products contain PFAS?\n\nPFAS chemicals are perhaps best-known for their use in nonstick cookware. The Teflon brand revolutionized such products, but the use of PFAS is widespread across many nonstick cookware brands.\n\nPFAS are also often behind any product that boasts waterproof or stain-resistant properties. Such products include clothing, rainwear, furniture, outdoor equipment, tapes, and cosmetics. They are also frequently used in food packaging to minimize the leaking of grease.\n\nPFAS are also frequently used in electronics, medical equipment, and renewable technologies. The military has used them in foams to help douse fires, particularly those that involve oil and can be water-resistant.\n\nWhat are PFOA and PFOS?\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are perhaps the two most studied PFAS chemicals. PFOA was a product primarily used by DuPont in its product lines, while PFOS was primarily used by 3M.\n\nDue to concerns about their persistence in the environment and potential for toxicity, DuPont, 3M, and other manufacturers reached an agreement with the EPA in 2006 to phase out PFOA and PFOS in the U.S.\n\nThat resulted in the increased use of a new generation of PFAS, still used today in many common products. Concerns have also arisen over their safety, most notably the “GenX” PFAS chemical, which led to significant contamination in North Carolina.\n\nWhat do PFAS do to your body?\n\nResearch is ongoing about how PFAS move through the environment, how Americans are exposed, and what the chemicals may do to our health.\n\nHealth experts become particularly concerned with any persistent chemical that also displays two other characteristics: those that are bioaccumulative, meaning they build up in living tissue, and those that are toxic, which means they harm living organisms, like plants, animals, and humans.\n\nThe degree to which PFAS are bioaccumulative or toxic changes based on both the specific PFAS chemical considered, and the opinion of researchers.\n\nIt is increasingly well established that PFOA and PFOS in particular are likely both bioaccumulative and toxic. Federal testing shows that they are in the blood of more than 98% of Americans and stay in the body years after exposure.\n\nLarge and numerous studies of highly exposed populations have linked them to health effects including ulcerative colitis, diagnosed high cholesterol, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.\n\nResearchers are also concerned about exposure to PFOA and PFOS among the general U.S. population, with some studies showing that even typical blood levels could be measurably driving up rates of kidney cancer, weakening immune systems and possibly causing tens of thousands of low-birthweight babies each year.\n\nThe threat posed by the 12,000 types of PFAS as a class of chemicals is a point of contention. Advocates of the chemical industry often argue that each PFAS chemical should be judged separately, and that newer PFAS chemicals are less likely to be harmful due to their chemical structures.\n\nBut advocates for stricter regulation say studies suggest many have shared characteristics and risks. They say testing each PFAS chemical individually is not feasible because of how many exist, and that instead the chemicals should be regulated as a class as a precaution.\n\nWhat’s the solution to PFAS?\n\nBecause the commercial and technological benefits of PFAS are substantial, it would be difficult stop their use. The chemicals also are already widely spread in the environment, even in remote areas such as the Arctic.\n\nIn the U.S., the EPA has laid out plans to learn where PFAS are, how to clean them up, how toxic they are, and which regulations need to be implemented to protect the public.\n\nBut many environmental groups and scientists say that more should be done, up to a complete phaseout of PFAS, except for absolutely essential uses.\n\nA commonly held view among environmental groups is that PFAS should at least be regulated as a single class in drinking water and the environment, to simplify the process of evaluating toxicity and deciding when to filter water.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/business/unilever-shampoo-recall/index.html", "title": "Dove, Nexxus and other dry shampoos recalled for cancer-causing ...", "text": "1.

The post continued to be widely read and circulated in May of this year.\n\n\"BVO is a toxic chemical that is banned in many countries because it competes with iodine for receptor sites in the body, which can lead to hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease and cancer,\" Clark's post states.\n\nA main ingredient of BVO, bromine, is a \"poisonous, corrosive chemical\" that has been linked to major organ damage, birth defects and other medical issues, the post says.\n\nClark's post quotes an online article — whose link in the Facebook post no longer works — that says there is \"flame retardant\" in Mountain Dew.\n\nBVO is a patented flame retardant for plastic and has been banned as a food additive in Europe and Japan. Soda binges have led to medical issues for some patients, the quote claims.\n\nClark updated her post this month, saying she had emailed PepsiCo Inc., which makes Mountain Dew, and received confirmation that the company has removed BVO as an ingredient for Mountain Dew.\n\nClark did not return a request for comment.\n\nWhat is brominated vegetable oil?\n\nBrominated vegetable oil has been used as a food additive since the 1930s to keep ingredients from separating in sodas and other beverages.\n\nRobert McGorrin, professor of food science and technology at Oregon State University, said BVO works as an emulsifier, particularly in beverages that use citrus oils, to keep the citrus oils from floating to the top of the drink.\n\n\"Instead of them kind of coalescing and ringing at the top — forming a film at the top of the soda — they're uniformly dispersed throughout,\" he said.\n\nBut the additive is banned in some countries due to concerns about possible health risks when it's ingested in large amounts.\n\nThe product originally carried the \"generally recognized as safe\" designation from the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., but that designation was removed in the 1970s. The FDA's position since 1977 is that BVO can be used safely \"on an interim basis,\" provided it is used in amounts of under 15 parts per million.\n\nMcGorrin said most beverages that contain BVO use it in much smaller amounts, such as 8 parts per million.\n\nIn 2014, Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo announced that they would remove brominated vegetable oil from their soft drinks. The announcement came as public pressure to remove the additive mounted, partially due to a Change.org campaign begun in 2012 by Mississippi teenager Sarah Kavanagh. Her campaign started when she began asking PepsiCo to remove BVO from its Gatorade products.\n\nDespite the 2014 announcement by both companies, reports from as recently as last year showed the ingredient remained in Mountain Dew.\n\nBut that ingredient has recently been removed. Nutrition facts posted on PepsiCo's product information website no longer include brominated vegetable oil as an ingredient. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment on when and why it removed the ingredient from the soft drink.\n\nIs brominated vegetable oil really a flame retardant?\n\nFor years, BVO has drawn a comparison to brominated flame retardants, leading to claims like the one mentioned in the post that there is \"flame retardant\" in Mountain Dew.\n\nBut the reality is more nuanced, said Christopher Reddy, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has studied brominated flame retardants and other brominated compounds.\n\nBVO could be used — and has been patented as — a flame retardant, he said. But the fact that it's patented doesn't mean it's in common use, or related to the vast majority of other brominated flame retardants.\n\nThe common brominated flame retardants in use are different from the food additive, he said.\n\n\"To lump all brominated flame retardants as one single entity about how it may interact with humans and the environment is not accurate,\" he said.\n\nMcGorrin said the common brominated flame retardants in use have different chemical makeups than BVO. Equating the two would be like comparing Splenda, a sweetener, with bleach, since both contain the element chlorine.\n\n\"People (are) just hearing the word 'brominated' and thinking all the negative connotations the word bromine brings with it,\" he said.\n\nResponding to articles comparing BVO to flame retardants, the Bromine Science and Environmental Forum — an industry group that represents companies that produce brominated flame retardants — issued a statement that said its member companies \"have never marketed BVO as a flame retardant.\"\n\n\"Apart from the fact that both contain bromine, there is no direct connection between brominated vegetable oil and brominated flame retardants,\" the statement said.\n\nIs brominated vegetable oil safe?\n\nBrominated vegetable oil has been controversial for years, and questions have continued about the general safety of the additive.\n\nAmerican Beverage Association spokesperson Danielle Smotkin said in a statement that BVO is \"safe, permitted by the FDA, and when used is listed as an ingredient.\"\n\nBut some scientists have recommended more study of the ingredient over the past decade. An article from Environmental Health News that was published in Scientific American in 2011 said there have been some some cases of patients who needed medical attention for bromine-related symptoms such as memory loss and nerve disorders after drinking large amounts of soda — more than 2 liters a day — that contained BVO.\n\nWalter Vetter, a food chemist at Germany's University of Hohenheim who has studied brominated vegetable oil, told Environmental Health News that \"the scientific data is scarce\" surrounding BVO, and it merits further study.\n\nCharles Vorhees, a toxicologist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center who studied BVO's effects more than 30 years ago, also told Environmental Health News that evaluations of chemicals has improved over the years, and he believes BVO should be reexamined.\n\nThe New York Times also reported in 2012 that some limited studies of BVO in humans and animals found bromine building up in tissues.\n\nReddy told USA TODAY that he believes there's still gray area in scientists' understanding of BVO.\n\n\"We know we drink it,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's fully understood about where it goes once it passes your teeth, how long it stays in your body and whether it breaks down in your body — whether it creates significant harm to the body or even chronic harm.\"\n\nHe said the stories mentioned in articles like the Scientific American are often from acute use, significant amounts drunk at once. But drinking smaller amounts over time could be different.\n\n\"I haven't seen the data that really works on those types of differences,\" he said.\n\nKatherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Mayo Clinic who has written about the use of brominated vegetable oil in beverages, agreed that she doesn't believe there's as much research on the buildup over time.\n\nShe said she believes it's unlikely that drinking soda in moderation, such as a can a day, would pose harmful effects. The worries come when a person drinks larger amounts.\n\n\"There's a concern that — with this additive, in particular, and many others — your body has to process it somehow,\" she said.\n\nZeratsky said she advises that people avoid drinking large amounts of beverages that contain BVO.\n\nOur ruling: Partly false\n\nThe Facebook post's claim that brominated vegetable oil is no longer in Mountain Dew is true. The use of brominated vegetable oil has declined over the years as major companies have removed the additive from their drinks in favor of other emulsifiers.\n\nBut experts agree that a sweeping comparison of the additive to flame retardant lacks nuance. It has been patented as one but is not the same as the brominated flame retardants in popular use.\n\nExperts also say it has also not been conclusively proven that drinking the amount of brominated vegetable oil found in soft drinks will lead to all of the negative health effects mentioned in the post. However, scientists agree more information is likely needed to broaden understanding of the ingredient's ability to build up in the human body over time, and that some people drinking large amounts of soda at once have experienced adverse effects.\n\nThat caution is reflected by the FDA's categorization of BVO as allowed in certain amounts on an \"interim\" basis, as well as the banning of the ingredient in some countries overseas.\n\nFor those reasons, we rate this post as PARTLY FALSE.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nIan Richardson covers the Iowa Statehouse for the Des Moines Register.

The CEH, which conducted the testing, is a non-profit consumer advocacy group focused on exposing the presence of toxic chemicals in consumer products.\n\nUnder California law — specifically Proposition 65, enacted in 1986 — the maximum allowable dose level for BPA via skin exposure is 3 micrograms per day.\n\nThe group also tested athletic shirts from brands that included The North Face, Brooks, Mizuno, Athleta, New Balance, and Reebok and found similar results.\n\nThe CEH said Wednesday it has sent legal notices to the companies, which will have 60 days to work with the center to remedy the violations before the group files a complaint in California state court requiring them to do so.\n\nTo date, the watchdog said its investigations have found BPA only in polyester-based clothing containing spandex. “We want brands to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols including BPA. In the interim, we recommend limiting the time you spend in your activewear by changing after your workout,” the group said.\n\nAthleta, Nike, Reebok, The North Face and Victoria’s Secret (which owns PINK) did not immediately provide a comment.\n\nBPA (Bisphenol A) is found in a large number of everyday products, from water bottles and canned foods to toys and flooring. In adults, exposure to BPA has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and erectile dysfunction.\n\nPremature death was also associated with BPA exposure, a 2020 study found. More recently, BPA has also been linked to asthma in school-age girls.\n\n“People are exposed to BPA through ingestion, from eating food or drinking water from containers that have leached BPA, or by absorption through skin,” Kaya Allan Sugerman, CEH’s illegal toxic threats program director, said in a statement.\n\n“Studies have shown that BPA can be absorbed through skin and end up in the bloodstream after handling receipt paper for seconds or a few minutes at a time. Sports bras and athletic shirts are worn for hours at a time, and you are meant to sweat in them, so it is concerning to be finding such high levels of BPA in our clothing,” Allan Sugerman said.\n\nOver the past year, the group has asked more than 90 companies, including Walgreens and socks and sleepwear brand Hypnotic Hats, to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols, including BPA. Some have already agreed to do so.\n\n“Even low levels of exposure [to BPA] during pregnancy have been associated with a variety of health problems in offspring,” said Dr. Jimena Díaz Leiva, science director with CEH.\n\nAlthough CEH litigates under California’s Clean Drinking Water and Toxics Enforcement Act of 1986, it says the repercussions of its settlements extend beyond California “as it is most often economically infeasible for companies to reformulate for just the California market.”\n\n“Our legal action has been successful in pushing entire industries to remove certain chemicals from products like children’s candy or toys,” the group said in a statement to CNN Business. “These cases not only serve to protect California consumers but also consumers throughout the country.”\n\n– CNN’s Sandee LaMotte contributed to this story", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}]}

Ron DeSantis railed against President Joe Biden over the influx of migrants across the nation’s southern border before signing a new state law Wednesday imposing tough penalties and new restrictions on undocumented immigrants in Florida.\n\nDeSantis, expected soon to announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, spoke in Jacksonville from a podium with a sign proclaiming, “Biden’s Border Crisis.”\n\nThe measure, approved last week by the Florida Legislature, has been condemned by critics as cruel and potentially leading to law enforcement profiling. It’s considered among the toughest steps taken by any state to deter illegal aliens from arriving.\n\n“We have to stop this nonsense, this is not good for our country,” DeSantis said, adding “this is no way to run a government.”\n\nA new surge of migrants is gathering at the U.S.-Mexico border in advance of the looming end of Title 42, a COVID pandemic policy that enabled authorities to quickly oust many migrants who entered the country without permission, rather than letting them stay while courts considered their cases.\n\nFrom USA TODAY:Biden says border will be `chaotic for a while' when Title 42 ends\n\nTitle 42 expires Thursday, as part of the end of the official COVID health emergency.\n\n“We’re bracing for some turbulent times ahead,” DeSantis said. “And I think when you have a president who has turned a blind eye to what’s gone on at the border... you’re likely to see it get a lot worse. We’re protecting Floridians, to the full extent of our ability.”\n\nThe federal Department of Homeland Security has unveiled plans aimed at dealing with the border, post-Title 42, including setting up additional facilities along the border to process migrants, bolstering transportation and leaning on a fast-track deportation process.\n\nSteps called cruel by advocates\n\nBut immigrant advocates said Florida’s approach targets with new criminal penalties and restrictions a community already struggling to survive. Immigrants, legal and illegal, represent a huge share of the state’s workforce, leaders added.\n\n“The immigrant community in Florida is facing an unprecedented attack on our ability to live, work and take care of our families,” said Pastor Omar Johnson, a co-founder of Mission Talk, which is among faith and social service organizations united under the name, Evangelicos for Justice.\n\nEvangelicos had urged DeSantis to veto the measure.\n\n“This legislation would harm the immigrant community by placing unnecessary and cruel obstacles to participation in nearly every part of daily life,” he added.\n\nThe bill (CS/SB 1718) signed by DeSantis strengthens employment requirements and allows state law enforcement officials to conduct random audits of businesses suspected of hiring undocumented workers.\n\nIt also gives DeSantis an additional $12 million for a migrant relocation program similar to the one used by the governor last year to lure almost 50 mostly Venezuelan asylum-seekers from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard off the Massachusetts coast.\n\nWhat to know:Florida House passes sweeping new immigration bill. Here's what's in SB 1718:\n\nLegislature on board with governorIllegal immigration crackdown approved by Florida House, sent to DeSantis\n\nMore relocations to come:State picks contractors for DeSantis' migrant relocation program amid Florida illegal immigration crackdown\n\nFlorida governors, then and nowTwo Florida Republican governors with different paths on immigration, elections on mind\n\nMore:Immigration checkpoints: Are there any in Florida?\n\nThat program already had $10 million set aside for it in a special legislative session earlier this year. Now, the state’s Division of Emergency Management under DeSantis has already selected three companies to carry out future rounds of migrant relocation.\n\nSuch relocations, also deployed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, drop ill-prepared migrants in blue state enclaves in a clearly political move aimed at embarrassing Biden and other Democratic leaders who the GOP blames for the immigration crisis.\n\nVoters say immigration system is broken\n\nA recent poll conducted for the immigrant advocacy groups Immigration Hub and Voto Latino showed that more than eight-in-10 voters believe the immigration system is broken. But the measure is especially animating among Republican voters.\n\nUnder the new law, which takes effect July 1, criminal penalties are increased for human smuggling, with third-degree felony charges imposed on anyone caught “knowingly” and “willingly” transporting anyone illegally in the country across state lines into Florida.\n\nTransporting a minor or more than five undocumented people into the state carries a second-degree felony penalty. Illegal migrants also could face felony charges by displaying a false ID to obtain employment.\n\nIn addition, all businesses with 25 or more employees would be required to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of new workers.\n\n'What are we going to do?'Two migrants share fears for the future in Florida crackdown\n\nUnder the legislation, local governments also would be banned from contributing money to organizations that create identification cards for undocumented immigrants and driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens in other states would be barred from use in Florida, a provision critics say may cause confusion and law enforcement profiling, especially in a diverse, visitor-filled state.\n\nHospitals receiving state and federal Medicaid reimbursements would be required to track how much money is spent on undocumented immigrants in emergency rooms.\n\nHospitals also would be required to ask patients about whether they are in the country legally, a standard opponents say will discourage many people from seeking health care – even those who have been living for years in Florida cities.\n\nA 2014 law allowing undocumented immigrants to be admitted to practice law in Florida also would be repealed.\n\nRepublican supermajorities clear the way for DeSantis\n\nRepublican supermajorities in the House and Senate did balk at including a DeSantis call for repealing a 2014 law extending in-state tuition to “Dreamers,” undocumented students who grew up in Florida. But almost every other requirement, penalty or limit on undocumented immigrants that DeSantis had called for in February, also during an appearance in Jacksonville featuring the “Biden’s Border Crisis” placard, has been included in the legislation.\n\n“This bill is politically driven and it’s an anti-immigrant bill that will hurt and even kill undocumented immigrants,” said Rep. Susan Valdes, D-Tampa, during debate on the legislation last week in the House.\n\nJohn Kennedy is a reporter in the USA TODAY Network’s Florida Capital Bureau.

Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled, “Liar!” from the back of the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nTalkative Biden:On average, Biden is most talkative president in six decades of State of Union addresses\n\nBiden repeats call for ‘billionaire’s tax’\n\nBiden used his speech to call again for Congress to pass a so-called “billionaire’s tax,” saying some of the biggest corporations in the country are raking in billions of dollars in profits but paying no federal income taxes.\n\n“That’s simply not fair,” he said.\n\nBiden did not spell out the specifics of his proposal. But in the past, he has called for a 20% levy on households with a net worth of more than $100 million.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat are the tax brackets?:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets? What are the new 2023 tax brackets? Answers here\n\nBiden calls climate crisis ‘an existential threat’\n\nBiden said “the climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state” as he touted his administration’s work to take on what he called “an existential threat.”\n\nHe pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest climate package ever, and investments from his infrastructure law.\n\nHe later went off-script, saying, “We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUN Secretary-General::'No more baby steps' on climate change\n\nBiden to Congress: Continue insurance subsidies that lowered uninsured rates\n\nBiden celebrated the fact that a record number of Americans have health insurance while calling on Congress to continue expanded insurance subsidies that helped boost that rate.\n\nThose enhanced subsidies for people who purchase insurance on their own, instead of getting coverage from the government or an employer, expire after 2025.\n\n“Let’s finish the job and make the savings permanent,” Biden said as he also called for extending expanded Medicaid coverage to all states.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden takes made in America a step further\n\nBiden touted American manufacturing gains and a campaign promise to move more production to the U.S. from foreign countries. Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections. Biden also congratulated her successor, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black American to be House minority leader.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat are burn pits?:Why were burn pits used? Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh is designated survivor for 2023 State of the Union\n\nSecretary of Labor Marty Walsh is the designated survivor for this year's State of the Union address.\n\nEvery year, a top government official is chosen as the “designated survivor” as a way to maintain the presidential line of succession in case of a catastrophic event where multiple officials in the line are unable to assume office.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMarty Walsh:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBono is at the State of the Union\n\nBono, the Irish lead singer of U2, is attending the State of the Union as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBono is a longtime social justice advocate who co-founded the nonprofit ONE Campaign to address poverty and preventable diseases and Prouct RED to address HIV and AIDS in Africa.\n\nHe’s sitting next to Paul Pelosi, husband of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\n2 Californians will sit behind Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may not share a political party. But they do have something in common. Both are from California.\n\nThat gave them at least one thing to talk about as they stood on the rostrum, waiting for Biden’s speech to begin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden gets a Supreme Court majority for speech, if not policies\n\nAt least for tonight, President Joe Biden landed a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nFive sitting Supreme Court justices stepped into the House chamber before the president’s remarks: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat’s a decent turnout for an event some current and former justices have derided as a “political pep rally” and a “childish spectacle.”\n\nWhether the president can cobble together a majority for any of his policies pending at the court – on immigration, student loan debt relief or environmental rules – remains to be seen.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden to get bipartisan escort into House chamber\n\nBiden will be escorted into the House chamber by a bipartisan group of House and Senate officials, including Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nFace masks uncommon as pre-pandemic normality returns\n\nFew lawmakers were wearing face masks as they filed onto the House floor for Biden’s State of the Union speech.\n\nAnd unlike last year, members of Congress were allowed to bring guests, a return to pre-pandemic normality.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden will declare, according to speech excerpts the White House released in advance.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m. ahead of his 9 p.m. State of the Union speech.\n\n“Great shape, getting better,” Biden said when a reporter asked him, “What’s the state of the union?” before he departed the White House.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n5 big questions for Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nPoll: Republicans want GOP leaders to 'stand up’ to Biden\n\nIf Biden doesn’t find a receptive audience to his call for the two parties to work together, Republican voters could be the reason.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) want GOP congressional leaders to “stand up” to Biden on matters important to GOP, even if that makes it harder to address critical problems facing the country, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd more are concerned that GOP lawmakers won’t focus enough on investigating the administration than the share worried that they will focus too much on investigations.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden approval rating hovering in low 40s ahead of speech\n\nBiden’s second State of the Union address Tuesday comes as he remains under water politically, with more than half of voters disapproving of his job performance, according to most polls.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll released this week found 42% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol. Vice President Kamala Harris arrived ahead of him along with the majority of his Cabinet.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nPaul Pelosi arrives at State of the Union\n\nPaul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived at the State of the Union about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThis marks his first visit to a joint session of Congress since a video release of a brutal October attack that left him with head and hand injuries requiring surgery.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nLawmakers arrive for State of the Union\n\nIf handshakes across the aisle are any reliable indication, there was a hint of bipartisanship in the air as lawmakers arrived for President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union before a divided Congress.\n\nThere was also the smell of cigars in the House gallery hallways on the third floor, a sign of the changing guard and new House rules.\n\nSeveral guests and congresswomen were wearing white, as a nod to the suffragettes. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/23/gun-violence-soars-president-biden-unveil-new-crime-strategy/5298021001/", "title": "As gun violence soars, President Biden unveils new crime strategy", "text": "Biden announced a \"zero-tolerance policy\" for rogue gun dealers.\n\nThe president encouraged states to use Covid-19 relief funding on public safety efforts.\n\nRepublicans blame a rise in crime on calls to \"defund the police\" from activists.\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden launched a new crime prevention strategy Wednesday in a push to take on soaring gun violence as Republicans blame a rise in crime on calls from progressive activists to cut police funding.\n\nIn a speech from the White House, Biden announced a \"zero-tolerance policy\" for rogue gun dealers and a new focus by the Justice Department to try to stop the illegal sale of firearms.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/03/30/atf-reveals-gun-stores-shut-down-federal-laws-violations/11568730002/", "title": "Gun stores shut down by ATF for flouting federal laws revealed", "text": "The nation’s gun regulator began naming publicly for the first time firearm dealers it says have flouted federal laws and will lose their license.

The information released today will assist the public in understanding how ATF handles inspections where significant violations are uncovered on the part of firearms licensees,” wrote Dettelbach, who became the agency's first confirmed director in seven years last July.\n\nHow has the ATF acted in the past?\n\nATF shop inspection results and revocations have for years been hidden from the public, available only after protracted legal battles tied to the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIn a sweeping investigation published in 2021, USA TODAY and The Trace found the ATF had been largely toothless and conciliatory, bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals.\n\nInvestigation:After repeated ATF warnings, gun dealers can count on the agency to back off; sometimes firearms flow to criminals\n\nWhat is Biden's agenda on gun control?\n\nThe ‘zero tolerance’ policy was announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland in June as part of Biden’s push to crack down on gun trafficking. Biden signed an executive order this month mandating more public naming of gun dealers that break federal rules and called for the ATF to post inspection results.\n\nLast year, ATF revoked licenses at a higher rate than in any year since 2006. ATF’s “Enhanced Regulatory Enforcement” policy focused on specific violations that pose public safety risks including:\n\nRefusing to allow ATF to conduct a lawful inspection.\n\nTransferring a firearm to a prohibited person.\n\nFailing to conduct a required background check.\n\nFalsifying records.\n\nFailing to respond to a firearm trace request.\n\nWhich gun stores were named by ATF?\n\nATF regulators revoked gun shop licenses in 2021 and 2022 under the zero-tolerance policy across 30 states.\n\nTexas had 11 shops revoked, the most in the nation. Texas historically has been home to the most gun shops in the country, with more than 11,000 licensed. ATF took eight licenses in Kansas and six in both North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nSee a full list of the revocations here.\n\nStore owners targeted for revocation can request a hearing and appeal a final license revocation in federal court. Often, shops that lose their licenses shut down, legally transfer their firearm inventory to other sellers, or reincorporate with new ownership.\n\nAmong the 93 named by the ATF was Game Changer Outdoors in Belhaven, North Carolina. Its license was revoked following a 2021 inspection that found 12 violations, including selling guns without a background check.\n\nGame Changer's manager Kayla Carrow confirmed Thursday that the bait and tackle store no longer sells firearms.\n\n\"We weren't pulling much money out of the firearms business and it was a lot of work to keep it going,\" Carrow said. \"Dealing with the government, everything had to be exactly right and it wasn't worth it anymore.\"\n\nWhat does the gun lobby think?\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun manufacturers and shops, wrote recently that it opposes “weaponizing” the zero-tolerance policy by “naming-and-shaming” shops for what it described as minor clerical errors.\n\n“Firearm retailers are the front line for ensuring firearms are sold only to those legally able to purchase them and 'zero-tolerance' risks the cooperative relationship between firearm retailers and (ATF),” representatives of the lobby group wrote.\n\nNick Penzenstadler is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

It is our chance for dignity,\" said Melissa Byrne, executive director of We The 45 Million, a coalition that pushed for student loan cancellation. \"Failure to deliver student loan relief is not an option.”\n\nFor months, the White House publicly resisted calls from liberal constituency groups to come up with a Plan B for student loan debt in anticipation of the conservative-majority court striking down Biden's action on student loans.\n\nEven when a majority of Supreme Court justices expressed deep skepticism over Biden's plan during oral arguments in February − signaling they would rule against the president − the White House refused to discuss a potential alternative.\n\nThen came Biden's announcement Friday afternoon.\n\n\"I believe the court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a mistake, was wrong,\" Biden said. \"But I'm not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic scale.\"\n\nSweeping loan forgiveness plan guttedSupreme Court strikes down Biden proposal to forgive debt for millions of borrowers\n\nHow far will the new plan go?\n\nConservatives justices on the Supreme Court ruled that a federal law called the HEROES Act that allowed the Biden administration to \"waive or modify\" the terms of student loans did not give the president the power to offer wholesale forgiveness of that debt.\n\nAll the details of Biden's alternative route and how far it could go aren't clear.\n\nBiden's original action sought to forgive $10,000 for all borrowers federal student loan borrowers and up to $20,000 in debt relief for low-income Pell Grant recipients. The debt cancellation was only available to borrowers with annual incomes less than $125,000 or from households earning $250,000 or less.\n\nThe Education Department generally uses the negotiated rulemaking process to develop policies that affect how the government distributes money meant for financial aid. The government holds a series of meetings with key stakeholders, which could include university leaders, loan servicers, students or others who might be impacted by the decision. That group will attempt to reach a common agreement on the new rules.\n\nIf they do, the government will adopt their guidance. If not, the department will decide if it should move forward with the new policy or could draft its own rule. It will give the public an opportunity to comment before the rules become final.\n\nRelying on the Higher Education Act is not a new idea; some plaintiffs in the case had raised it at the Supreme Court. Two borrowers who sued Biden over student loans claimed in a brief that the only reason the administration avoided relying on it was because of the \"lengthy negotiated rulemaking and notice-and-comment\" that would be required. In other words, they said, it would take longer.\n\nCardona said the administration chose the HEROES Act as its initial path because it offered a \"quicker\" pathway. White House officials stressed the new alternative route could take \"months\" to roll out following the federal review process and periods for public comments.\n\nSome borrower advocacy groups were skeptical of the president's new plan to deliver student loan relief saying he isn't leveraging every tool he has, and the fresh proposal will take far too long. Others warned that the court's decision, while a setback for loan borrowers, will serve as motivation for young voters to come out for Democrats in the 2024 election.\n\n\"President’s Biden plan was a historic action that would have provided life-changing relief to young people,\" said Tzintzún Ramirez, president of NextGen America, a progressive advocacy group for young voters. \"Instead, Republican and partisan forces worked to obstruct this relief – and we know that young voters will remember this come 2024.\"\n\nAnother reprieve for borrowers on payments\n\nIn addition to starting over on student loan forgiveness, Cardona said borrowers who can't make payments when the pause on student loan bills ends in October will have a one-year reprieve on the consequences that come along with missed payments.\n\nLoan forgiveness takes many forms.Only one is blocked.\n\nWhile interest will begin to accrue on those loans during what the department called an \"on-ramp\" period from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, borrowers who don't make payments won't be reported to credit agencies or have their loans referred to collection agencies.The original pause on payments, first instituted under former President Donald Trump at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, also directed that servicers stop their collection attempts.\n\nDoes Biden have other options?\n\nAnother way legally to achieve the same goal – forgiving up to $20,000 in student loan debt for low- and middle-income households – would be for Congress to act. But Biden lacks the votes for legislative action.\n\nBoth bodies of Congress − including the Democratic-controlled Senate − voted to repeal Biden's student loan forgiveness action, forcing the veto pen of Biden to keep his plan alive before the court's decision.\n\nThe White House also has touted its previous efforts to cancel debt through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. However, it's limited to borrowers working in the public sector.\n\nSome legal experts have argued Biden could propose a narrower plan that still invokes the HEROES Act, although it likely would have a significantly smaller reach.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2023/07/27/joe-biden-kate-gallego-announce-new-plan-to-combat-heat/70478024007/", "title": "President Joe Biden, joined by Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, unveils ...", "text": "Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego appeared virtually Thursday with President Joe Biden to announce additional action to protect communities from extreme heat.\n\nThe president called the current climate \"unprecedented\" and urged collaboration to protect Americans.\n\nHere's what the Biden administration is doing:\n\nActing Labor Secretary Julie Su is issuing a heat hazard alert, which clarifies that workers have protections from harmful heat conditions.\n\nSu will work with her team to intensify inspections of workplaces that are considered \"at risk.\"\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service will award over $1 billion dollars in grants for cities and towns to plant trees that he says will propel access to green spaces to help people cool off.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is proving \"billions\" to communities to make buildings more efficient and heat-resistant.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is launching a partnership with universities to improve the nation's forecast accuracy.\n\n\"Our MAGA extremist Congress are trying to undo all this progress,\" Biden said. \"We're not going to let that happen.

It’s not just Homeland Security Investigations, it’s not just US Customs and Border Protection. But we’re working very carefully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a number of agencies within the Department of Justice, and, of course, our partners in Mexico,” Mayorkas told CNN.\n\n“I think it’s scale and scope; it’s tactics and strategy. It’s really unprecedented,” he added.\n\nMayorkas is attending the Ninth Summit of the Americas, which is being hosted by the United States in Los Angeles. The gathering of nearly two dozen heads of states from the Western Hemisphere has focused on stabilizing the region and investing in it to, in part, stem the flow migration – an issue that has dogged US presidents, including Joe Biden, for years.\n\nThe mass migration within the hemisphere came into sharp focus again this week, as thousands of migrants joined a caravan heading to the US southern border. Asked about how the latest operation applies to that caravan, Mayorkas stressed the administration is “tackling the smuggling organizations that exploit these people.”\n\nThe “Sting Operation,” led by the Department of Homeland Security, has so far yielded around 20,000 “disruption actions” that include arrests and prosecutions, seizures of property and criminal investigations, according to the department. The US has also surged over 1,300 personnel throughout the Western Hemisphere and invested over $50 million.\n\nIn the last eight weeks, nearly 2,000 smugglers have been arrested, marking a 600% increase in law enforcement actions taken against such actors compared to efforts in previous years, DHS said.\n\nThe latest operation builds upon previous initiatives by the Biden administration to go after smugglers who migrants often depend on as they make their way to the US-Mexico border. Last spring, DHS also announced an effort to crack down on criminal smuggling organizations, alongside federal partners.\n\nDHS also set up a new intelligence gathering and law enforcement unit to monitor the movement of migrants and helped stand up a task force, led by the Justice Department, to investigate and prosecute human smuggling and trafficking networks.\n\nMigration looms over Summit of the Americas\n\nAt the US southern border, a new trend has been taking shape that’s posed a challenge to the Biden administration: About 40% of border crossers are now from countries outside of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nMore than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled the country, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Nicaraguans have also increasingly been migrating, as well as Haitians who had moved to the region years ago.\n\nOver the course of Summit of the Americas, administration officials have acknowledged the mass migration in the Western Hemisphere, stressing the need for all countries to help alleviate the flow and create better conditions in country.\n\nThe gathering has served as a platform for the Biden administration, leaders of countries in the region, and the public and private sector to come to agreements about the path forward in stemming the flow of irregular migration.\n\nBiden has aimed to demonstrate a level of cohesion across the two continents’ politics, but boycotts by leaders of several nations – including Mexico and three Central American countries – has put a damper on the summit.\n\nThe four leaders refused to attend because Biden declined to extend invitations to the three autocratic leaders, instead sending lower-level delegations.\n\nMayorkas dismissed concerns about key leaders skipping the summit, telling CNN: “All the countries are represented here. So, of course, the president of Mexico is not here but I had the good fortune of seeing the foreign minister of Mexico, Secretary Ebrard, here with whom I have worked very closely throughout my trips to Mexico as well as our continuing dialogue. So no, my confidence is unblemished.”\n\nNew funding for stabilization efforts\n\nOn Friday, against the backdrop of the Summit of the Americas, Biden announced a regional partnership to address mass migration in the Western Hemisphere. The agreement, dubbed the Los Angeles declaration, was signed onto by 20 Western Hemisphere nations.\n\nThe agreement “is centered around responsibility sharing and economic support for countries that have been most impacted by refugee and migration flows,” a senior administration official said ahead of Friday’s unveiling.\n\nUnder the declaration, governments are expected to commit to expanding temporary worker programs, bolstering legal pathways like refugee resettlement and family reunification, providing support to countries hosting large migrant populations, and cracking down on human smuggling networks.\n\nSpeaking at an event unveiling the declaration alongside other signatories, Biden said, “No nation should bear this responsibility alone.” The President also asserted it was on “every country” to maintain orderly and human migration process.\n\n“We need to halt the dangerous and unlawful ways that people are migrating,” he continued. “Unlawful migration is not acceptable.”\n\nBiden also underscored that human traffickers would not be tolerated, saying, “If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you.”\n\nThe US announced $314 million in new federal funding for “stabilization efforts in the Americas,” according to a White House factsheet. Leading up to the Summit of the Americas, administration officials repeatedly stressed the need to support countries in the region who are hosting migrants and refugees, especially Venezuelans who have fled their origin country in large numbers.\n\nThe funding is part of a concerted effort to encourage countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to share the responsibility as it relates to migration in the hemisphere and provide opportunity to migrants in hopes of stemming irregular migration.\n\nColombia and Ecuador, for example, are among the countries providing support to Venezuelans and have committed to providing a path to legal status within their countries for those migrants.\n\nCanada also plans to bolster its efforts by increasing the number of refugees it admits from the Americas to up to 4,000 by 2028. Similarly, the US will resettle 20,000 refugees from the Americas over the next two years, marking an increase from previous years. And Spain will “double the number of labor pathways for Hondurans,” the fact sheet says.\n\nWhile at the summit this week, Biden has stressed economic opportunity in the region and providing jobs, which is reflected in the latest slate of migration commitments.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture announced a pilot program to support US farmers in hiring agricultural workers under existing temporary work visas. Mexico committed to integrating thousands of refugees into the Mexican labor market over the next three years, while Canada said it will take in more than 50,000 agricultural workers from Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean this year.\n\nWhen asked by reporters how the US plans to keep on tabs on the various commitments, a senior administration official said it would be an “ongoing dialogue.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/agriculture/2022/01/03/biden-administration-reveals-meat-processing-industry-expansion-plan-lower-prices-farming/9075325002/", "title": "New Biden plan aims to expand meat processing, lower consumer ...", "text": "The Biden administration announced Monday it will allocate $1 billion to expand independent beef, pork and chicken processing in an effort to increase competition and reduce costs for consumers.\n\nThe White House said the plan also is aimed at boosting profits for livestock producers, who have complained they are getting low prices while consumer costs have soared. President Joe Biden met Monday with farmers, ranchers and independent processors to roll out the initiative, tapping the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Act to fund the effort.\n\nThe action comes after Biden, whose administration has blamed a near-monopoly in meatpacking for the sharp increases in costs, signed an executive order in July seeking to increase competition.\n\nMeat prices were the single largest contributor in November to the rising cost of food Americans prepare at home, the administration said, with beef, pork and poultry price hikes making up a quarter of the overall increase.\n\n\"In too many industries, a handful of giant companies dominate the market,\" Biden said in Monday's meeting. \"And too often they use their power to squeeze out smaller competitors and stifle new entrepreneurs, making our economy less dynamic, giving themselves free rein to raise prices, reduce options for consumers or exploit workers.\n\n\"The meat industry is a textbook example,\" Biden said.\n\nAlso attending the meeting were Iowa Farm Bureau Federation President Brent Johnson, who raises cattle and farms in northwest Iowa, and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor.\n\nSarah Little, spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute, whose members include giant processors Cargill Inc., Tyson Foods, JBS USA and National Beef Packing Co., said prices for producers have rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic forced a wave of temporary meatpacking plant shutdowns in 2020.\n\n“The market has already begun to balance itself,\" Little said in an email Monday.\n\nPrices for cattle producers are the highest they've been in five years, based on quarterly data.\n\n\"This is because packers have begun to clear the backlog of cattle created by the pandemic. The herd size is shrinking while demand remains high,\" Little said.\n\nShe said access to labor is the biggest hurdle that packers face in expanding the meat supply, and she predicted that \"new capacity and expanded capacity created by the government will have the same problem.\"\n\nBiden's plan calls for providing financing, worker training and technical assistance to independent processing companies that expand capacity. It includes $500 million the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in July it would make available to expand slaughter capacity and competition.\n\nScott Blubaugh, president of the Oklahoma Farmers Union, told Biden that more local meat processing will enable farmers, ranchers and rural towns to \"retain more of that retail food dollar.\"\n\n\"For too long, we have seen the multinational meatpackers suck out all of the wealth of rural America and put it in their corporate coffers, and in some cases, even overseas,\" Blubaugh said.\n\nA broader base of production will help lift rural communities out of poverty, he said. \"We have a great problem, a poverty problem in rural America,\" he said.\n\n\"We are grateful for the administration’s attention to this issue that impacts not only farmers’ profitability and rural vitality, but also affects consumers at the grocery store,\" said Iowa Farm Bureau President Brent Johnson. \"We must work toward a more stable, resilient food supply chain that can better endure unforeseen challenges and ensure farmers are paid an honest price for their product.”\n\nMore price transparency, stronger enforcement against market abuses sought\n\nBiden said he wants to give producers selling their cattle more information about pricing, address consumer labeling issues, and strengthen a law designed to combat meatpacker abuses.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the justice and agriculture departments will launch a portal within 30 days to receive requests for investigation of potential violations of the competition laws, including the Packers and Stockyards Act, a 1921 statute addressing unfair, deceptive and anti-competitive practices in meat markets.\n\nThe administration said meatpackers and processors \"buy from farmers and sell to retailers like grocery stores, making them a key bottleneck in the food supply chain.\n\n\"When dominant middlemen control so much of the supply chain, they can increase their own profits at the expense of both farmers — who make less — and consumers — who pay more,\" it said.\n\nMORE: 'We're fighting for a way of life': Pandemic causes Iowa cattle farmers to lose money while consumers pay more\n\nThe White House said Monday it used information from 450 comments to the agriculture department to help develop its initiative. Some highlights of the Biden policy initiative include providing:\n\n$375 million in \"gap financing\" grants to jumpstart meat processing projects that \"truly expand capacity outside the largest meat and poultry processors.\" The agriculture department will provide $150 million in its first phase for roughly 15 projects, and another $225 million in the second phase.\n\nUp to $275 million in capital for banks to provide loans and other financing with favorable terms for independent processors investing in cold storage, specialized equipment and other needs.\n\n$100 million to provide loan guarantees for more than $1 billion in loans.\n\n$100 million to train workers for well-paying, safe jobs.\n\n$50 million to provide technical assistance and research that will lower barriers for entrepreneurs, independent companies and others looking to add meat processing. The effort is intended to help businesses better understand environmental, food safety and worker safety requirements.\n\n$100 million to reduce overtime and holiday inspection costs for small and very small poultry, meat and egg processing plants so they can keep up with unprecedented demand. The initiative is expected to cut fees 30% to 75%.\n\nChad Tentinger, who's leading development of Cattlemen’s Heritage, a planned, independent $450 million beef processing plant near Council Bluffs, said government assistance is needed to help projects like his.\n\nAfter three years of losses, producers are now getting higher prices for cattle, Tentinger said, but those increase are unlikely to persist as the cattle herd is rebuilt. He said he hopes new slaughter capacity will mean \"we don't have to go through this vicious down cycle again.\"\n\nAdministration: Overreliance on handful of processors leaves industry susceptible to disruption\n\nThe administration said in a statement that the concentration of production in the meatpacking industry makes it susceptible to shocks — such as the global pandemic, fires or cyberattacks — that temporarily shutter processing plants.\n\nMORE: A Guatemalan immigrant takes on big ag, seeks to set farmers free by starting their own chicken processing plant in Iowa\n\n\"Our overreliance on just a handful of giant processors leaves us all vulnerable, with any disruptions at these bottlenecks rippling throughout our food system,\" it said.\n\nData from publicly traded companies — Tyson, JBS, Marfrig, which owns National Beef, and Seaboard Foods — shows their gross profits have collectively increased by more than 120% since before the pandemic, and their net income has surged by 500%, the administration said last month.\n\nThe administration rejected processor claims that prices have risen to offset higher labor, transportation and livestock costs.\n\n\"Their profit margins — the amount of money they are making over and above their costs — have skyrocketed since the pandemic,\" it said. \"Gross margins are up 50% and net margins are up over 300%. If rising input costs were driving rising meat prices, those profit margins would be roughly flat.\"\n\nThe agriculture department said it will issue \"Product of USA” labeling rules this year so that consumers can better understand where their meat comes from, the administration said. Now, livestock raised outside of the United States can be labeled as a U.S. product if it's processed in this country.\n\n\"We believe this could make it hard for American consumers to know what they are getting,\" the administration said, adding that the agriculture department already has begun \"its top-to-bottom review of the current labeling rules.\"\n\nThe administration cited four Iowa lawmakers — U.S. Sens.

LOUIS — A player in California won a $1.73 billion Powerball jackpot Wednesday night, ending a long stretch without a winner of the top prize.\n\nThe winning numbers were: 22, 24, 40, 52, 64 and the Powerball 10. The winning ticket was sold at Midway Market & Liquor in Frazier Park, according to the California Lottery.\n\nPhone calls Wednesday night to Midway Market & Liquor went unanswered.\n\n“The phone’s been ringing off the hook, people saying congratulations. Pretty crazy,” the store’s night worker, identified only as Duke, told KCAL-TV.\n\n“Somebody owes me a truck,” he said with a smile. “A lot of customers come in, you know they come in every day to get their tickets, religiously. And a lot of them ... said: ‘Oh, if I win I’m gonna get you a new truck.’ So where’s my truck? I’ll be waiting.”\n\nHe expected the winner will be a local resident.\n\nBefore someone won the giant prize, there had been 35 consecutive drawings without a big winner, stretching back to July 19 when a player in California matched all six numbers and won $1.08 billion.\n\nThe jackpot is the world’s second-largest lottery prize after rolling over for 36 consecutive drawings, since the last time someone won the top prize on July 19. That streak trails the record of 41 draws set in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe only top prize that was ever bigger was the $2.04 billion Powerball won by a player in California last November.\n\nPowerball’s terrible odds of 1 in 292.2 million are designed to generate big jackpots, with prizes becoming ever larger as they repeatedly roll over when no one wins. And wins in recent months have been few and far between.\n\nThat didn’t bother those eager to plunk down their money on Wednesday for a long-shot chance at instant wealth.\n\nRobert Salvato Jr., a 60-year-old electrician, bought 40 Powerball tickets at a hardware store in Billerica, Massachusetts.\n\n“I would take care of family and give my cat that extra leg that she needs and make her a good kitty,” said Salvato, who got married on Saturday.\n\n“I could give her a ring on every finger, I guess,” Salvato said of his new wife.\n\nNevada is among the five states without Powerball, so friends Tamara Carter and Denise Davis drove from Las Vegas across the state line into California to buy tickets. But the line was so long at their first stop that they gave up and went in search of another store.\n\n“The line was about three hours long,” Carter estimated. “I was waiting for maybe a half hour, and it didn’t move.”\n\nThe jackpot has grown enormous due to a long dry spell. The previous winning Powerball ticket was sold on July 19, and it was worth $1.08 billion after 39 drawings without a jackpot win.\n\nAt the same hardware store as Salvato, Kevin Button seemed to understand the long odds as he bought a ticket.\n\n“I only buy them usually when the jackpot’s high,” Button said. “Seems to have been pretty high quite often lately. So I’ve tried quite a few times and haven’t even won a free ticket. But maybe tonight’s the night.”\n\nIn most states, a Powerball ticket costs $2 and players can select their own numbers or leave that task to a computer.\n\nThe $1.73 billion jackpot is for a sole winner who opts for payment through an annuity, doled out over 30 years. Winners almost always take the cash option, which for Wednesday night’s drawing is estimated at $756.6 million.\n\nWinnings would be subject to federal taxes, and many states also tax lottery winnings.\n\nPowerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/10/10/powerball-jackpot-billion-drawing/71127431007/", "title": "When is the next Powerball drawing?

Results posted to Powerball.com similarly said there was one winner who matched all six numbers in California – the odds of which were 1 in 292.2 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\nThe winning numbers, which were announced Tuesday morning after Monday night’s drawing was delayed, were 10-33-41-47-56 and the Powerball was 10, according to the association.\n\nAnd while you likely weren’t the jackpot winner, lotteries are urging players to check their tickets on the chance you won one of the other – albeit smaller – prizes: Per the Multi-State Lottery Association, more than 11.2 million tickets won cash prizes totaling $98.1 million, including 22 tickets that won $1 million prizes for matching the five white numbers but not the Powerball.\n\nThe jackpot was a record $1.9 billion but grew to $2.04 billion by the time of the drawing, the association said in a statement, “making it the world’s largest lottery prize” – just as its organizers intended when they changed the odds in 2015.\n\nIn fact, the jackpot was so large that California lottery officials didn’t have the appropriate signage: At the gas station where the winning ticket was sold, just northeast of Los Angeles, they taped a “B” onto signs that read, “Millionaire made here,” so they would instead read, “Billionaire made here.”\n\nThe winner has yet to come forward, said Carolyn Becker, a spokesperson for the California lottery, adding, “Somebody is holding on to a very important piece of paper this morning.”\n\nThe ticket did, however, make one millionaire: Joseph Chahayed, the owner of the gas station, was awarded his own $1 million for being the retailer who sold the winning ticket.\n\nJoseph Chahayed is the shop owner who sold the winning Powerball ticket. Chahayed now receives a $1 million bonus check. CNN/CNN\n\nChahayed, who came to the US from Syria in 1980 with his wife and two children, told reporters he arrived at the gas station Tuesday morning to find California lottery officials waiting for him.\n\n“They said, ‘Congratulations, your station sent a winner,’” he said, adding he hoped the winner lived in the neighborhood. The grandfather of 11 also said he was happy the lottery benefited California schools.\n\nThe announcement of a winner Tuesday came after officials delayed the drawing Monday night, due to what the Multi-State Lottery Association called a “technical issue.”\n\nThe association initially said overnight the delay was caused when one participating lottery needed more time to process its sales and play data, echoing an earlier statement by the California Lottery, which said one lottery needed additional time to complete the necessary security protocols.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota Lottery announced its sales verification system caused a processing delay, prompting the postponement of the drawing.\n\n“The delay was necessary to confirm the Powerball drawing could be conducted securely and accurately,” the Minnesota Lottery release said. “At no time was the integrity of the process compromised.”\n\nAll 48 participating lotteries are required to submit their sales and plays before the winning numbers can be selected, the Multi-State Lottery Association said in a statement overnight. “Powerball has stringent security requirements to protect the integrity of the game and remains committed to holding a drawing that gives all players a fair chance to win,” the association said.\n\n“Like the rest of America, Powerball is eager to hold its drawing for the world record jackpot,” the association said in a follow-up statement Tuesday morning before the drawing, “however, protecting the integrity of the draw is of upmost importance, even if that means a further delay,” the statement early Tuesday said, urging players to hold on to their tickets.\n\nAccording to the Multi-State Lottery Association, Tuesday’s jackpot was hit on the 41st draw of the run, marking the sixth time the Powerball jackpot was hit in 2022. The last Powerball jackpot was won on August 3 in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe largest Powerball jackpot ever won was in January 2016, when three winners split a prize advertised at $1.586 billion. Each took their share of the cash value, which added up to $983.5 million.\n\nPowerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.\n\nPowerball is played by charging $2 per ticket and having players choose five white balls between the numbers 1 to 69 and a red Powerball from the numbers 1 to 26. If a player gets all six numbers correct, they win the massive jackpot.\n\nThe odds of winning the jackpot by matching all 5 numbers and the Powerball number are one in 292.2 million.\n\nPrior to 2015, though, the white balls were numbered 1 to 59 and the Powerball was numbered 1 to 35. The change means that now gamblers have better odds of winning small prizes but worse odds of winning the jackpot, making it more likely that the big number will grow to record sizes.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Dakin Andone", "Aya Elamroussi", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/03/04/how-to-play-powerball/11202854002/", "title": "How to play Powerball: A guide to Powerball rules and potential prizes", "text": "Since its launch in 1992, the Powerball has offered an opportunity for many people to chase a dream: to win the lottery.\n\nWhether you win a couple bucks or take home the top prize, the lottery can be an enticing game.

Still, you can't help but buy a ticket. Why?\n\nThe Powerball is making headlines once again after the winning ticket was sold in California Wednesday for the whopping $1.76 billion jackpot.\n\nIt's a hefty prize, but the odds of winning, as with most lotteries, were astronomically small − about 1 in 292.2 million. For context, you're more likely to get killed by a shark, fatally hit by a meteor or struck by lightning.\n\nYou're also more likely to worsen your mental health in the process of playing the lottery, experts say.\n\n\"If you're struggling with your bills and you're looking to make the money through buying scratchers or playing the lottery, and you lose that money, it's money that you really can't afford to lose,\" Steve Kobashigawa, a marriage and family therapist specializing in addiction, previously told USA TODAY. \"Of course, it creates more stress, anxiety, depression and it has a very significant impact on mental health.\"\n\nWhen does playing the lottery become a problem?\n\nIf the odds of winning the lottery are so low, why do people bother playing? Dan Field, a therapist specializing in gambling addiction treatment, says the lottery holds such a prominent place in American culture because it gives people the opportunity to indulge in fantasies about how their lives could change if they win.\n\n\"There's this desire to be financially unburdened and free − the fantasy that I'm going to always have enough money to do whatever I want, and no one is going tell me what I do,\" he previously told USA TODAY. \"That fantasy can become almost an obsession for some people.\"\n\nIt also becomes a problem, he says, when people of lower socioeconomic status see the lottery as their only chance of joining the ranks of the mega-wealthy.\n\n\"With gambling, like with other activities, it can become a single-minded focus, and all other avenues of potential joy fade away,\" Field said. \"They're not as important as the gambling activity.\"\n\nMore:Mega Millions is up to $1.55B. No one is winning, so why do we keep playing the lottery?\n\nMost people are able to play lotteries for fun without falling into addictive or destructive patterns. For example, Kobashigawa notes, only about 2% of people in California, the state with the third largest lottery sales in 2022 according to Statista, suffer from a severe gambling disorder or pathological gambling addiction.\n\nStill, when gambling addictions occur, they can wreak disastrous consequences, including job loss, homelessness, family fractures, bankruptcy and criminal activity, like fraud and embezzlement, he says.\n\n\"It isn't a very large number, but when it does happen, it's pretty significant,\" Kobashigawa said, adding he's worked with many clients who became addicted to buying lottery tickets. \"There's a very high prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide with people who struggle with gambling disorder.
