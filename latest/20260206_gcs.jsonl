So it’s not a surprise that Vermont has played an important role in the development of winter sports. For a small state, Vermont can claim many firsts.\n\nThe first winter carnival in the United States was held at Vermont Academy in 1909. The Dartmouth Winter Carnival is based on the Vermont Academy event and this year marks the 108th carnival at Dartmouth. The first United States National Skiing Championships consisting of cross country and jumping were held in Brattleboro in 1924. The first ski lift in the United States was a rope tow on Gilbert’s Hill in Woodstock.\n\nBoth the National Ski Patrol and the legendary 10th Mountain Division trace their beginnings to Vermont. The first U. S. National Snowboarding Championship was held at Suicide Six in 1982 although it was actually called “Snow Surfing” at that time. Founded in 1970, Burke Mountain Academy was the first winter sports academy in the U.S.\n\nVermont winter athletes have also gained international acclaim. Andrea Mead Lawrence was the best woman skier of her era garnering two gold medals at the 1952 Winter Olympics. Billy Kidd was the first United States man to win an Olympic medal in alpine skiing and Bill Koch was the first in Nordic skiing. In snowboarding, Ross Powers and Kelly Clark were the first Americans to win Olympic gold.\n\nBirth of the Vermont Ski Museum\n\nRoy Newton is a Vermont editor and publisher who currently lives in Castleton and publishes the Lakeside News and Rutland Sun. But in the 1980s he was the publisher of the Vermont Ski News. Newton traveled around the state collecting news, soliciting ads, and distributing the paper.\n\nOne day driving towards Burlington from Montpelier, he decided Vermont with all its skiing history should have its own ski museum. He came to this decision with such conviction that he turned his car around, returned to Montpelier, and registered the name Vermont Ski Museum with the state.\n\nThat was in 1988. Newton set the museum up as a nonprofit, which meant it required a board of directors. He called upon some of those who had supported his Vermont Ski News as advertisers which included Chuck and Jann Perkins, founders of the Alpine Shop in South Burlington.\n\nNewton in his travels around the state began collecting retired ski gear, equipment, machinery, signs, library materials and other skiing memorabilia, but where to store them? Newton was also working at the Brandon Inn and secured the use of a shed behind the inn. So the first physical museum was located in Brandon down a muddy alley behind the Brandon Inn. Visitation was by appointment only and the collection was not stored in an organized fashion.\n\nChuck and Jann remember that board meetings were informal, usually over lunch somewhere in Killington. Fundraising was always a challenge. They ran various events around the Killington area including a wet T-shirt contests at the Wobbly Barn. Eventually they were able to secure a location for the museum on U.S. 4 between Rutland and Pico near the Cortina Inn. While this seemed like a good location, traffic whizzing by wasn’t that interested in stopping for a museum.\n\nChuck and Jann lobbied for the museum to move to Stowe particularly if a location in the village was available. It would be easier for the museum to attract pedestrian traffic than automobiles traveling 50 miles per hour. Which brings us to ...\n\nHistory of Town Meeting House\n\nThe Town Meeting House in Stowe was built in 1818 and is the oldest active public building. The meeting house originally occupied the lot on North Main Street where the Stowe Community Church now stands. The meeting house was to be used as a church for all religious groups and as a town house for various civic meetings. For more than 40 years various denominations worshipped in this common church building until they erected their individual churches.\n\nIn 1861 the Universalists obtained the land where the meeting house sat. To make room for their church (which would become the Stowe Community Church in 1920), the meeting house was moved by a team of oxen to its current location on South Main Street. By the 1890s it was used as the Town Hall and gymnasium.\n\nWhen the Akeley Memorial Building was built in the early 1900s it became the Town Hall, but the old meeting house remained the home for various town services. This included the Stowe Fire Department, which used the building until 1973.\n\nThe Stowe Water and Light Department, which was the last remaining town agency in the old meeting house, left the building in 2000. The town of Stowe was left with the decision of what to do with the old meeting house. The building was condemned and costly repairs would be required to restore it for useful purposes, but it was an historic part of Stowe.\n\nBringing the museum to Stowe\n\nA group of Stowe business persons including Chuck and Jann Perkins saw the old Town Meeting House as an opportunity. In order to preserve an historic building, why not use it to preserve a significant segment of Vermont’s history? A museum would provide another village attraction that could draw visitors and help business. The group negotiated with Roy Newton and purchased his collection along with the associated rights.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nHistory of Mount Mansfield Ski Patrol\n\nEpic history of Stowe Mountain Resort\n\nNext they launched a $1.4 million campaign to save the condemned Town Meeting House as the home of the new Vermont Ski Museum. Managed by volunteers throughout the state, the campaign reunited Vermont ski racers, 10th Mountain Division members, area developers, self-professed ski bums and industry pioneers. The Perkins’s played a significant role in the campaign. As Chuck tells it, he had just sold one of their Stowe properties when he found out that the campaign had decided the renovated museum building would be named for top level donor. Chuck came home and told Jann, “I gave the money from the house away.”\n\nThanks to the Perkins’s and many others who contributed, the goal was reached and renovations began. Much of the building’s structure had to be restored and even the old bell tower which had been removed years before was restored. One new addition was a giant moving mobile to display the museum’s historic ski lift exhibit.\n\nThe Vermont Ski Museum opened its doors in the restored Town Meeting House which was now the “Charles N. and Janet B. Perkins Building” on Aug. 16, 2002. Double gold medalist Andrea Mead Lawrence cut the ribbon at the grand opening.\n\nIn 2010 the museum’s name was changed to the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum to recognize the impact Vermont and Vermonters have had on the development of snowboarding.\n\nThe museum today\n\nThe museum’s mission statement is “to Collect, Preserve, and Celebrate Vermont’s Skiing and Snowboarding history!”\n\nSince 2002, the museum collection has more than doubled. There are approximately 8,000 individual items preserved by the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum. Ski equipment includes about 275 pairs of boots, 400 pairs of skis, 100 pairs of poles, 55 pairs of climbing skins, and 60 loose bindings for both cross country and downhill skiing, and the carrying equipment — bags, boot trees, and ski racks.\n\nMechanical equipment, the smallest collection at about 75, includes large items necessary for the operations of ski areas such as snow making equipment, lifts, communication equipment, and race timing devices. Most of this is the first timing equipment, including the first electronic eye that starts and stops timing based on motion, used in Vermont, perhaps in the United States.\n\nVermont Ski Areas collection contains location-specific items. There have been over 130 ski areas in Vermont. Items range from trail signs to ashtrays to chandeliers. The 10th Mountain Division collection includes early fleece, climbing equipment, WWII rations, medals, and archival material. The fine art collection holds original paintings, drawings, and sculpture and posters and graphics by Vermonters or of Vermont locations and events. The library and archives represents a large portion of the museum’s holdings, including over 550 books, 350 magazines, 75 postcards, 50 instructional booklets, 200 pamphlets related to Vermont ski areas and some original photography and film footage.\n\n“Curious & Cool,’ the museum’s current exhibit, features an eclectic mix from 30 years of collecting: from one of Andrea Mead Lawrence’s gold medals to moon boots; from Mount Mansfield ticket books to one of Warren Witherell’s water skis. The museum plans a new main exhibit every year, but maintains several permanent exhibits. The 10th Mountain Division exhibit salutes those Vermonters who served in the 10th during World War II. The National Ski Patrol exhibit tells the story of how its roots can be traced back to Vermont.\n\nVermont Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame\n\nThe museum also hosts the Vermont Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame. A selection committee nominates a set of candidates each year and welcomes suggestions from the public. A special induction event is held each year to welcome those selected. Andrea Mead Lawrence was the first inductee in 2002.\n\nVermonters in the WWII 10th Mountain Division were inducted in 2003. Other notable inductees include Billy Kidd and the Cochran family in alpine skiing; Bill Koch and Martha Rockwell in Nordic skiing; Jake Burton, Donna Carpenter and Ross Powers in snowboarding.\n\nThe Hall of Fame also includes the Paul Robbins Journalism Award to recognize Vermonters who have distinguished themselves writing about and covering winter sports. This past year the award went to Vermont icon Peter Miller.\n\nIn 2017 a new award was added to the Hall of Fame. The “First Tracks Award” honors exceptional and ongoing contributions to skiing or snowboarding in Vermont by someone under 35. The First Tracks Award is given in memory of Ian Graddock, a Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum board member, lifelong skier and ski racer, who passed away in 2016 at age 35.\n\nIn its inaugural year, the First Tracks Award went to snowboarder Kevin Pearce, who was on a trajectory to snowboard in the 2010 Olympics when he crashed and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Since then, he’s gone on to set up the Love Your Brain Foundation to help others with TBIs.\n\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame event, the museum sponsors other events throughout the year. In the past these have included antique ski races in both Alpine and Nordic disciplines. This year the museum has held a series of panel discussions called “Thirsty Thursdays.” These events are co-sponsored by Vermont Ski & Ride Magazine, Collective Arts Brewing, and Hetta. The next Thirsty Thursday entitled “Snowboarding – Past, Present, and Future” will be held on March 8 at the museum.\n\n2018 – A special year\n\n2018 marks the 30th anniversary of what started as the Vermont Ski Museum. It marks the 16th year that the museum has been in Stowe. And it marks the 200th anniversary for the old Town Meeting House that is now the home for the museum. We hope you’ll plan a visit to the museum to help us celebrate these milestones and celebrate Vermont’s skiing and snowboarding history!\n\nMeredith Scott is curator of the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum.

Not only is this an important milestone for women ski jumpers, it is a measure of progress for elite female athletes in all winter sports.\n\nThis Olympics marks the 90th anniversary of the first Winter Games, held in Chamonix, France, in 1924. At those Games, the only sport women could compete in was figure skating. The other events, such as ski jumping and bobsledding, were considered too dangerous for them.\n\nWhile the Sochi Games offer the most opportunities for women of any Winter Olympics yet, there still is not parity: 14 of 15 sports include competition for women; Nordic combined, in which athletes compete in both cross-country skiing and ski jumping, remains the only holdout. Of the 93 individual events in Sochi, 43 are for women while 50 are for men.\n\nThe reasons for the unequal treatment of women, like concern over women's health, are anachronistic and sexist.\n\nWhen I competed in the luge in the 1976 Olympics in Austria, only half of the sports had competition for women. Ice hockey, biathlon, ski jumping, Nordic combined and bobsled remained the sole domain of men. Women's biathlon was added to the 1992 Winter Olympics, women's ice hockey in 1998 and two-woman bobsled in 2002.\n\nIn addition to this persistent gender gap, many events treat women and men athletes differently. For example, in cross-country skiing and the luge, women have shorter distances than those for men. Women are allowed to drive two-women bobsleds, but not four-women ones. Men can compete in both disciplines.\n\nOne reason given for excluding women from competing in the same sports and at the same distances as men is concern for their safety. For example, some people feared ski jumping would damage a woman's uterus. There is no medical proof of this. Virtually every Olympic sport is dangerous.\n\nAnother excuse has been that the field of high-caliber female competitors in a given sport is low. That can be a self-fulfilling prophesy, because sports without Olympic recognition suffer from a lack of investment and visibility by their country and thus lower participation. Unfortunately, it is all too often that the sports treated as second-class citizens are those in which women compete.\n\nI am extremely grateful that luge included women from the time it became an Olympic sport in 1964. The privilege of donning the USA uniform and competing with other young people from across the globe is an experience I always will cherish.\n\nAnd while I cheer, I will also hope that it's not too much longer before we see women driving a four-women bobsled, or ski jumping off the big hill, just like the men.\n\nMaura Grogan also was a competitive figure skater, and on the inaugural varsity women's ice hockey team at Yale University.

It’s a plane. It’s … a ski jumper!\n\nThe high-flying sport returns at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Predazzo, Italy, with six events, including the debut of individual women's large hill and the men’s super team.\n\nIt's been 102 years since an American ski jumper has made the podium at the Winter Olympics. Team USA's one and only ski jumping medal came in 1924 when American Anders Haugen won bronze in men's large hill individual in the inaugural Chamonix Winter Olympics. The U.S. was shut out at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nWhen did ski jumping become a Winter Olympic sport?\n\nSki jumping was featured in the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics with men's large hill ski jump. Men's normal hill ski jump was added to the program at Innsbruck in 1964, while the men's team event was introduced at Calgary in 1988. Women's normal hill ski jump was added at Sochi in 2014, and the mixed team event was first contested at Beijing in 2022. Two new events are set to make their debut in 2026: Individual women's large hill event and the men’s super team event.\n\nHow does Olympic ski jumping work?\n\nThe high-flying sport features athletes launching themselves as far as they can off a ramp. The jump features four elements: In-run, takeoff, flight and landing. Don't forget about style points. Judges score athletes not only on their length and distance traveled, but also on their form throughout the entirety of the jump. The amount of jumps per event varies, but the end goal is the same. The highest combined score wins. There's six events:\n\nNormal hill individual (men and women): Each athlete gets two jumps.\n\nEach athlete gets two jumps. Large hill individual (men and women): Each athlete gets two jumps.\n\nEach athlete gets two jumps. Super team (men): Each team, made up of two athletes, gets three jumps. This event replaces the traditional men’s team event that was contested from 1988-2022.\n\nEach team, made up of two athletes, gets three jumps.

Prevc is the reigning world champion in the normal and large hill events, becoming the first woman to win two individual gold medals at the same championship.

Need to brush up on your knowledge of spins and jumps? Have no fear, our event-by-event guide is here to help.\n\nBobsled (February 13 to February 20)\n\nNico Walther, Kevin Kuske, Alexander Roediger and Eric Franke of Germany compete in their final run of the four-man Bobsled Heats at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? A form of transport for centuries, the bobsled was introduced at the first Winter Olympics in 1924 in Chamonix, France, where it started off as a four-man event.\n\nTeams of two or four compete by zooming down an icy track in a curved, cone-like sled, with the fastest total time earning first place. The sport is a bit like Formula 1 on ice because it involves turbulent speeds, consistent pacing and high power, according to the Olympics website.\n\nThe addition of a two-man competition was made at the Winter Games in 1932 in Lake Placid, and progressively a two-woman event at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US. Since then, it’s found a place in popular culture, notably the film “Cool Runnings,” which followed the Jamaican bobsled team as they trained to compete at the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nThis year, there will be 12 medals up for grabs across four events including the two-man, two-woman and the four-man. For the first time, there will also be a women’s monobob event. The track has 16 curves and a maximum gradient of 18%. At 1,615 meters (one mile) in length, it will be the first track of its kind in the world to have a 360-degree turn.\n\nWho are the favorites? Defending Olympic champion Germany will hope to replicate their performance at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, where they won every single bobsled event.\n\nHowever, a contender in the women’s monobob and the two-woman’s bobsled event could be Kaillie Humphries of Team USA, who claimed gold when she was competing for Canada in the Winter Games at Vancouver 2010 and Sochi 2014. US duo Sylvia Hoffman and Elana Meyers Taylor – who has three Olympic medals to her name – could also be in contention for gold.\n\nIn the men’s competition – where last Games’ two-man event resulted in Germany and Canada being crowned joint winners – Francesco Friedrich of Team Germany is a firm favorite, having claimed two gold medals at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nFreestyle skiing (February 5 to February 14)\n\nWhat is it? Featuring balletic techniques and acrobatic skills, the International Ski Federation (FIS) first recognized freestyle skiing as a discipline in 1979.\n\nAthletes ski in a motion that is similar to skating. They perform technically challenging moves during their runs and are scored on different aspects of their performance, depending on the competition they’re participating in.\n\nIn the aerials events, slopestyle, moguls and halfpipe, judges score competitors based on the finesse of their tricks and the form of their runs.\n\nHowever, athletes in the big air are judged by the distance and height of their jumps. As for the ski cross, the competition is a timed event – so the athlete who traverses the finish line first takes gold.\n\nFreestyle skiing made its debut as a demonstration sport at the Winter Games in 1988 in Calgary, Canada, and was given medal status at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.\n\nEvents include the men’s and women’s aerials, moguls, ski cross, halfpipe and slopestyle, as well as the new men’s and women’s freestyle skiing big air and the mixed team freestyle skiing aerials competition.\n\nWho are the favorites? Two-time world champion Sandra Näslund of Sweden is a podium favorite in the women’s ski cross.\n\nHowever, China’s Eileen Gu could be a worthy challenger. The 18-year-old made history at the X Games in 2021, when she became the first rookie to earn medals across three events and the first freeskier to ever win more than one world title in a single year.\n\nIn the men’s moguls event, defending Olympic champion Mikaël Kingsbury of Canada is the name to look out for. The most accomplished mogul skier in history, he has claimed the highest number of medals of any male participant ever at the Freestyle World Championships.\n\nSnowboarding (February 5 to February 15)\n\nEster Ledecká of Czech Republic won gold in the Women's Parallel Giant Slalom at PyeongChang 2018. Laurent Salino/Agence Zoom/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Snowboarding is one of the more recent additions to the Winter Games, having debuted at the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan. Despite its novel status, the sport has fast become a crowd pleaser at the Games.\n\nThe snowboard cross events and the parallel giant slalom are all races. Whereas in the big air, halfpipe and slopestyle, judges score and assess riders based on aspects of their performance including the complexity of their tricks, the form of their run and the landing of their jumps.\n\nThere will be 11 gold medals available across 11 snowboarding events at this year’s Games including the men’s and women’s parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross, halfpipe, slopestyle and big air – as well as a new mixed team snowboard cross competition.\n\nWho are the favorites? With its roots in 1960s America, snowboarding has given rise to accomplished US athletes such as Shaun White, Jamie Anderson and Chloe Kim. They will be looking to add to the 31 medals under Team USA’s belt – making it the most successful nation ever in the Olympic event, ahead of Switzerland.\n\nOther hopefuls in the women’s draw include two-time Olympic medalist Eva Samková of the Czech Republic, Italy’s Michela Moioli and Charlotte Bankes of Team Great Britain.\n\nJapan’s Ayumu Hirano could pose a threat to White’s ambition for Olympic glory at Beijing 2022 in the men’s events.\n\nShort track speed skating (February 5 to February 16)\n\nChina's Li Jinyu (2nd L), PyeongChang 2018 short track speed skating 1,500m silver medalist, competes during a short track speed skating test event for Beijing 2022 in April 2021. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Making its debut on the Olympic program at the Winter Games in 1992 in Albertville, France, short track speed skating dates back to 1905, when athletes in Canada and the United States would compete on oval tracks.\n\nHowever, the scarcity of 400m long tracks in each country meant that a number of North American skaters chose to practice on ice rinks instead.\n\nOne of three skating events at the Winter Olympics, short track speed skating requires tight turns, strategic positioning and high speeds. Athletes compete on an ice track and field without lanes, so they are prone to both crashes and injury.\n\nThe competition at Beijing 2022 will feature nine events: men’s and women’s 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m – as well as the men’s 5,000m team relay and the women’s 3,000m team relay, alongside the new mixed team relay competition. There will be nine gold medals up for grabs in total.\n\nWho are the favorites? South Korea, China and Canada have historically been the most successful teams at Olympic short track speed skating events – with 81 medals between them.\n\nDefending Olympic champion Wu Dajing of China is a favorite for gold in the men’s short track speed skating. Hungarian brothers Liu Shaoang and Shaolin Sándor Liu, who were gold medalists in the men’s 5,000m relay event at PyeongChang 2018, could also be worthy contenders – however, Shaoang tested positive for Covid on January 24 putting his competition hopes in doubt.\n\nIn the women’s events, South Korea will pin their hopes for gold glory on Olympic record holder Choi Min-jeong, who claimed gold medals in the women’s 1,500m, and the women’s 3,000m relay at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nChoi’s main opponent could be eight-time Olympic medalist Arianna Fontana of Italy. If Fonata wins one more medal at Beijing 2022, she would be the most successful athlete ever at the Olympics in the short track event.\n\nCross-country skiing (February 5 to February 20)\n\nMarit Bjoergen of Norway (8) leads the field during the Ladies' 30km Mass Start Classic at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Cross-country skiing is the oldest type of skiing and evolved as a form of travel between remote communities.\n\nCross-country skiers either use the freestyle technique, where they ski side-to-side, or the classic technique, which involves striding forward. The techniques used in each event vary during each edition of the Games, depending on the guidelines set by the FIS.\n\nCross-country skiing was one of the first ever Winter Olympic sports, debuting at the 1924 Games in Chamonix, France, with men’s events. Nearly 30 years later, women’s events were inaugurated at the 1952 Oslo Olympics in Norway.\n\nThere will be 36 medals for the taking across 12 events at this year’s Winter Olympics.\n\nIn the men’s events, there will be the 15km classic, 15km and 15km skiathlon, sprint free, team sprint classic, 4x10km relay and the 50km mass start free. Female competitors will participate in the 10km classic, 7.5km and 7.5km skiathlon, sprint free, team sprint classic, 4x5km relay and the 30km mass start free.\n\nWho are the favorites? Team Norway has been the consistent frontrunner in cross-country skiing at the Olympics, with a whopping 121 medals to its name – that’s 41 medals ahead of runners-up Sweden.\n\nNorwegian athletes Johannes Høsflot Klæbo and Simen Hegstad Krüger will be hoping to repeat their stellar performances at PyeongChang 2018, where they picked up six medals between them.\n\nNonetheless, Team Sweden have a powerful roster in the women’s cross-country events, including three-time Olympic champion Charlotte Kalla, two-time world champion Jonna Sundling and up-and-comer Frida Karlsson.\n\nSki jumping (February 5 to February 14)\n\nWhat is it? Sondre Norheim is said to be the father of modern ski jumping, having won what is considered the world’s first ski jumping competition with awards in 1866 in Høydalsmo, Norway.\n\nThe sport was added to the Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Three decades later, Switzerland’s Andreas Daescher developed the parallel style in the 1950s, where skiers lean forward and brace their arms backwards, close to their body.\n\nCompatriot Jan Bokloev honed the parallel style in 1985, by unfurling the tips of his skis into a V shape – a technique that most ski jumpers use today. Jumps are appraised by the style of the jump and the distance covered.\n\nThere will be five gold medals to win across five events at Beijing 2022. The competitions include the men’s normal hill individual, the women’s normal hill individual, the men’s large hill individual, the men’s team – and for the first time, the mixed team event.\n\nWho are the favorites? Norway, Finland and Austria are in the lead when it comes to Olympic ski jumping, having fetched 82 medals between them.\n\nIn the men’s normal hill competition, Germany’s Andreas Wellinger defense of his 2018 individual gold medal is in doubt as he tested positive for Covid in January. His compatriot Karl Geiger and Piotr Żyła of Poland will look to take advantage of Wellinger’s absence.\n\nIn the women’s draw, Slovenia’s Ema Klinec will be eyeing the podium. Despite finishing 14th at PyeongChang 2018, she recently won the normal hill 2021 World Championships.\n\nAlpine skiing (February 6 to February 19)\n\nWendy Holdener (L) of Switzerland and Hungary's Mariann Mimi Maroty compete during the Alpine Team Event at the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Games. Tom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Athletes frequently reach speeds of almost 95 miles per hour in one of the most physically exhausting sports in the Winter Olympics. Athletes can log their fastest times in the downhill and super-G competitions, whereas the slalom and giant slalom events occur over two slower courses.\n\nModern downhill skiing can be traced back to the 1850s, when Sondre Norheim introduced skis with curved flanks, and bindings with rigid, willow heel bands.\n\nWomen’s and men’s alpine skiing events made their debut at the 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen Olympics in Bavaria, with more categories being added up to PyeongChang 2018, when the mixed team event became the newest competition in the alpine skiing roster.\n\nThere will be 33 medals to win across 11 events at Beijing this year, including the men’s and women’s downhill, super-G, slalom and giant slalom, the alpine combine and the mixed team competition.\n\nWho are the favorites? Austria has historically dominated the medal count in alpine skiing, earning 121 medals.\n\nAmerican Mikaela Shiffrin is the one to watch in the women’s draw, having won two gold medals at PyeongChang 2018 and Sochi 2014. Other fierce competitors could include Michelle Gisin of Switzerland and compatriot Lara Gut-Behrami.\n\nFrance’s Mathieu Faivre could use his three Games’ worth of experience to his advantage this year, while current super-G and downhill world champion Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria is also among the favorites for gold.\n\nBiathlon (February 5 to February 19)\n\nWhat is it? The biathlon event is a combination of skiing and shooting. It can be traced back to Scandinavia, where people would hunt using skis and have rifles draped over their shoulders.\n\nAt the Winter Olympics, skiing and shooting take the form of a race, where competitors ski along a trail and the distance is punctuated into shooting rounds. Penalties for missed shots vary with each event and take the form of either additional time, or distance, being added to a participant’s total.\n\nBefore the biathlon was introduced to the Games at the 1960 Winter Olympics in California, an older version of the sport appeared in previous editions of the Olympics. The military patrol involved athletes competing in ski mountaineering, cross-country skiing and rifle shooting.\n\nThere will be 33 medals up for grabs across 11 biathlon events: the women’s 7.5km sprint, 15km individual, 10km pursuit, 12.5km mass start and 4x6km relay. In the men’s draw, events include the 10km sprint, 20km individual, 12.5km pursuit, 15km mass start and 4x7.5km relay. A 4x6km mixed relay event is also scheduled to take place.\n\nWho are the favorites? Germany and Norway have previously collected the most medals in the biathlon event, earning nearly 100 medals combined.\n\nFive-time Olympic medalist Tiril Eckhoff of Norway is a favorite for gold this year, alongside Swedish sisters Hanna Öberg and Elvira Öberg.\n\nIn the men’s draw, Norway’s Johannes Thingnes Bø and compatriot Sturla Holm Lægreid could add to their country’s medal count.\n\nCurling (February 2 to February 20)\n\nWhat is it? Curling is one of the oldest sports at the Winter Olympics. It has origins in 16th century Scotland, where games took place on frozen ponds and lochs.\n\nAthletes use their own brush and a pair of curling shoes – one with a sole that grips the ice, known as the gripper, and another that is slippery, known as the slider, which helps them to pivot while conveying 20-kg (45-pound) granite stones during the match.\n\nThe team that manages to deliver more stones near the center of the scoring area than their opponent wins. It is a sport that requires precise technique and strategy.\n\nAfter it debuted at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France, curling was dropped and temporarily featured as a demonstration sport, before it was reintroduced to the Olympic program at the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.\n\nThere will be nine medals up for grabs across three events at Beijing 2022, including the men’s curling, women’s curling and mixed doubles curling.\n\nWho are the favorites? Canada has been the most successful curling team ever at the Olympics, winning 11 medals – that’s three more than challengers Sweden. Other notable contenders across all three competitions include South Korea, Japan and Switzerland.\n\nTeam USA could repeat their success at PyeongChang 2018, where they claimed gold in the men’s curling event. In the women’s draw, defending Olympic champions Sweden could reclaim their victory, but World Curling Championship winners Switzerland could pose a threat.\n\nIce hockey (February 3 to February 20)\n\nWhat is it? Despite having just two events, ice hockey remains a crowd favorite at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe rules are simple – the winning team must net the puck and score more goals than their opponent.\n\nDuring play, a team can’t have more than six players on the ice. The positions are as follows: goalkeeper, two wings, two defenders and a center. In the event of penalties, there can be fewer players on the ice.\n\nWomen currently compete in a 10-team tournament, while men participate in a 12-team event.\n\nIce hockey was first added to the Olympic program at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and was permanently moved to the Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France.\n\nThere will be two medals available to win at Beijing 2022: the men’s tournament and the women’s tournament, Reuters reported.\n\nWho are the favorites? The National Hockey League (NHL) and its union have decided not to dispatch players to Beijing this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, so the Russian Olympic Committee has become a firm favorite for gold in the men’s draw.\n\nIn the women’s competition, Canada will be chasing gold after losing to the United States in the final at PyeongChang 2018.\n\nSpeed skating (February 5 to February 19)\n\nGermany's Claudia Pechstein competes during the Ladies' Speed Skating Mass Start Final at PyeongChang 2018. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? First debuting at the 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics, speed skating involves athletes racing alongside each other, with each skater hoping to set the fastest time out of all the participants in the field.\n\nAthletes race across a 400m oval-shaped track for individual races, where the fastest places first.\n\nIn the team pursuit, three-person squads representing two different countries compete in an eight-lap race on opposite sides of the track. Each team must race as a group, and their times are determined by the third person who crosses the finish line.\n\nThere are 16 laps in the mass start event, which is a points-based competition. Almost 24 skaters can take part at the start of the event.\n\nThere will be 14 medals for the taking across 14 events at Beijing 2022, including the women’s 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, 5,000m, 10,000m, mass start and team pursuit, and the men’s 500m, 1,000m, 1,500m, 3,000m, 5,000m, mass start and team pursuit.\n\nThe number of speed skating events held makes it the largest sport at this year’s Winter Olympics.\n\nWho are the favorites? The Netherlands, the United States and Norway tend to dominate speed skating at the Winter Games, boasting a combined 273 Olympic medals in total.\n\nNine-time Olympic medalist and Team Netherlands star Sven Kramer will be looking to add to his tally at Beijing 2022. The defending world champion in the men’s 5,000m and 10,000m events, Sweden’s Nils van der Poel, is also a favorite for gold.\n\nEleven-time Olympic medalist and Dutch athlete Ireen Wüst and Erin Jackson of Team USA will be the ones to beat at Beijing 2022, although Japan’s Nao Kodaira and Miho Takagi could also be worthy contenders.\n\nThe Nordic combined (February 9 to February 17)\n\nWhat is it? The Nordic combined event is comprised of cross-country skiing and ski jumping. It is one of the few competitions at the Games that’s yet to introduce a women’s draw.\n\nCompetitors win points for the style and distance of their ski jump. The better-scoring jumpers subsequently get a head start in the staggered cross-country skiing element – the conversion of points to time is known as the Gundersen method.\n\nThe Nordic combined was the centerpiece of the Holmenkollen ski festival, which began in Oslo, Norway in 1892. Since then, the sport has garnered an international fanbase and has been an enduring event at the Games since the first Winter Olympics in 1924 in Chamonix.\n\nThere will be three gold medals up for grabs at this year’s Games across three events, Reuters reported: men’s individual Gundersen normal hill / 10km, men’s individual Gundersen large hill / 10km, and men’s team Gundersen large hill / 4x5km.\n\nWho are the favorites? Norway has clinched the most medals for the Nordic combined event in the history of the Games, claiming 31. Finland and Austria are close challengers.\n\nHowever, Eric Frenzel of Germany could bolster his team’s Olympic glory this year, having won a medal in every Nordic combined event at PyeongChang. Japan’s Akito Watabe, who earned a silver medal in Gundersen normal hill / 10km at the Winter Olympics in 2014 and 2018, could also make the podium alongside Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber.\n\nLuge (February 5 to February 10)\n\nPeter Penz and Georg Fischler of Austria celebrate as they finish a run during the Luge Team Relay on day six of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. Quinn Rooney/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? The luge is one of three sliding sports at the Winter Games this year, alongside the bobsled and the skeleton.\n\nCompetitors can reach average speeds of 120 to 145 kilometers per hour (74.56 to 90 mph) when racing the luge. Athletes race on the same track in the singles competition and get four tries across two days. Their aggregate times are counted to the thousandth of a second, with the quickest athlete placing first.\n\nThe doubles event has a similar structure but is set across two days, with each pair getting two runs. Three sledges from different nations – the women’s singles, men’s singles and doubles – compete in the team relay, which debuted at the Games at Sochi 2014.\n\nAll three sliding sports originated in St. Moritz, Switzerland.\n\nThere will be four gold medals to win across four events at the Games this year, including the men’s singles, men’s doubles, women’s singles and the team relay.\n\nWho are the favorites? Germany are usually the frontrunners in the luge, followed by Austria and Italy.\n\nThey could maintain their lead in the event with defending Olympic champion Natalie Geisenberger. Her challengers could be fellow team members Julia Taubitz and Dajana Eitberger.\n\nIn the men’s draw, triple Olympic gold medalist Felix Loch will be looking to reclaim his title at Beijing 2022, having finished fifth in the men’s singles at PyeongChang. Team Austria’s David Gleirscher ended up winning the event that year, and so could prove a worthy challenger.\n\nSkeleton (February 10 to February 12)\n\nWhat is it? With its roots in sleighing, the skeleton is a fan favorite at the Winter Olympics.\n\nAthletes participate on the same track across two days, getting four runs each. The competitor with the fastest combined time wins the event.\n\nAfter British and American holiday goers constructed the first toboggan run in 1882 in Davos, Switzerland, a new steel sledge was built ten years later – which became known as the skeleton. It fell in and out of the Olympic program for a number of years, before it was reintroduced at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nThere will be just six medals available across two events at Beijing 2022, including the men’s singles and the women’s singles.\n\nWho are the favorites? Great Britain and the United States are the two main frontrunners in the skeleton event, having earned 11 medals between them.\n\nTeam GB’s Laura Deas will have her eye on first place this year, having clinched a bronze medal in PyeongChang. Jacqueline Loelling and Tina Hermann of Germany are worthy challengers for Team GB, as well as China’s Zhao Dan and Lin Huiyang.\n\nIn the men’s draw, six-time world champion Martins Dukurs of Latvia will be chasing gold this year, having participated in the event since 1998, but defending Olympic champion Yun Sungbin of South Korea could be a worthy competitor. Geng Wenqiang and Yin Zheng will also be going for gold, hoping to boost the medal count for hosts China.\n\nFigure skating (February 4 to February 20)\n\nScott Moir and Tessa Virtue of Canada perform during the Figure Skating Gala Exhibition at Gangneung Ice Arena on February 25, 2018 in South Korea. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nWhat is it? Figure skating is the oldest event at the Winter Olympics. The event first debuted at the London Summer Games in 1908, and again in the 1920 Summer Games in Antwerp, before it was permanently moved to the Winter Olympic program.\n\nEach competition incorporates a long and short routine, within which athletes receive two sets of scores – the program component score and the technical element score. The program component element is mainly determined by presentation, while the technical category assesses the complexity displayed in a routine, for example, spins and jumps.\n\nEven though the Dutch developed figure skating, the sport has been enjoyed by fans the world over, including Marie Antoinette and the 19th century French emperor Napoleon III.\n\nThere will be five medals for the taking across five figure skating events at Beijing 2022. The events are as follows: the men’s singles, women’s singles, pairs, the ice dance and the team event.\n\nWho are the favorites? The United States has historically garnered the most success in figure skating at the Olympics, having earned 51 medals.\n\nThey’ll pin their hopes on bronze medalist Nathan Chen in the men’s draw, who could be challenged by defending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan and his teammate Shoma Uno.\n\nIn the women’s draw, teen prodigy and record holder Kamila Valieva could claim medals for the ROC, alongside teammate Anna Shcherbakova. Chinese duo Sui Wenjing and Han Cong are strong contenders in the pairs events, having won silver at PyeongChang, while France’s Guillaume Cizeron and Gabriella Papadakis are returning favorites in the ice dance competition.", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/04/curling-winter-olympics-milano-cortina-schedule/87951622007/", "title": "Curling at 2026 Winter Olympics: How it works, competition schedule", "text": "Feb. 4, 2026 Updated Feb. 5, 2026, 8:53 a.m. ET\n\nMILAN — Curling has emerged as a cult classic at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. will be represented in all three curling events the 2026 Milan Cortina Games, with Team Casper competing in the men’s curling event after John Shuster's bid to compete at his sixth consecutive Winter Games fell short. Team Peterson and the duo of Cory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin will also represent Team USA in the women’s curling event and mixed doubles, respectively.\n\nAll three teams will look to win Team USA's first curling medal in eight years. The U.S. has only won two curling medals in Olympic history, most notably a gold medal won by Team Shuster in the men's event at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. The U.S. hasn't made the Olympic podium in the women's or mixed doubles events.\n\nWhen did curling become a Winter Olympic sport?\n\nMen's curling was part of the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Games, but it was held as a demonstration event in 1932 at Lake Placid, in 1988 at Calgary and in 1992 at Albertville. Men and women's curling were officially added to the program for the 1998 Nagano Olympic Winter Games, while mixed doubles made its debut at Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nHow does Olympic curling work?\n\nTwo teams of four people each take turns gliding 44-pound stones down a sheet of ice toward a target that looks like a bullseye. Each match features six to 10 rounds, called ends. The stones have a handle on them, so when they are released, they curl down the ice. As the stone glides toward the target, players sweep the ice in front of it, which can affect the direction and the speed of the stone.\n\nDuring each round, teams take turns throwing eight rocks, and the team with the rock or rocks closest to the center of the target wins the end. Players can throw guards to block the target, draws to try to score or takeouts to remove the opponent's stones as each end plays out. There are three curling events:\n\nMen’s curling\n\nWomen’s curling\n\nMixed doubles\n\nWho are the top Team USA athletes in curling?\n\nCory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin : The duo is set to make its Olympic debut in mixed doubles at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games after becoming the first U.S. mixed doubles team to win gold at the world championships in 2023. Thiesse will also represent Team U.S. in the women's curling event.\n\n: The duo is set to make its Olympic debut in mixed doubles at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games after becoming the first U.S. mixed doubles team to win gold at the world championships in 2023.

What to know", "text": "Updated July 24, 2024, 1:08 p.m. ET\n\nPARIS − The Winter Olympics are officially returning to the United States.\n\nMore specifically, the Games are coming back to Utah.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee members voted Wednesday to formally award the 2034 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, making Utah's capital a repeat Olympic host more than three decades after it served as the site of the 2002 Olympics. It will be the fifth time the U.S. has hosted the Winter Games.\n\n\"We are ready. Everything is in place,\" Fraser Bullock, leader of Salt Lake City's bid committee, said in a presentation at the IOC session Wednesday. \"But beyond our physical assets, you can count on our people. As great as our venues are, our people are even better.\"\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nWednesday's vote was essentially a rubber stamp; Salt Lake City already had been handpicked by the committee as the best option for 2034. Though it did come with a bit of unexpected controversy − a strange scene in which committee members used the moment to rip the United States for its recent political actions around the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the controversial doping case involving 23 Chinese swimmers.\n\n\"I'm sorry for you, and for us, that this issue arose now,\" IOC president Thomas Bach told Salt Lake's bid committee.\n\nUltimately, though, the last-minute concerns were never going to be enough to derail Wednesday's vote, which passed 83-6. The news prompted celebration in the early morning hours back in Utah, where the committee 's vote coincided with a state holiday, Pioneer Day.\n\nMembers also signed off on the French Alps as host of the 2030 Winter Games earlier in the day.\n\nIOC airs concerns over U.S. stance on anti-doping\n\nIn the hour before the vote to award the Winter Games to Salt Lake City, they took an uncommon detour to express concerns about how a doping scandal involving Chinese swimmers has been handled in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and its chief executive officer, Travis Tygart, have been extremely critical of WADA's handling of the Chinese swimmers case, in which 23 athletes tested positive for a banned heart medication ahead of the 2021 Tokyo Games. WADA accepted the results of a Chinese government investigation that attributed the positive tests to contamination at a hotel and neither publicly disclosed the tests at the time.\n\nUSADA's criticism has been followed by a congressional hearing and a reported investigation by U.S. law enforcement, apparently under the auspices of the Rodchenkov Act, which allows U.S. authorities to pursue criminal charges in doping cases that affect U.S. athletes.\n\nIt is the Rodchenkov Act, in particular, that seemed to prompt the ire of IOC members ahead of Wednesday's vote. And John Coates, one of Bach's top lieutenants, said the committee went so far as to amend Salt Lake's host city contract to address the matter. According to Coates, the IOC can terminate the host contract if \"the supreme authority of (WADA) in the fight against doping is not fully respected.\"\n\nGene Sykes, who chairs the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, responded to the members' concerns by praising WADA and renewing the United States' commitment to clean sport.\n\n\"We certainly accept the obligations and responsibility inherent in the amendment to the Olympic host contract,\" Sykes said. \"So from our perspective, we take very seriously to heart all of your comments, and we pledge to you that we will be good partners and we will support, with you, this very, very important institution.\"\n\nSalt Lake's road to becoming 2034 Olympic host\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has supported Salt Lake City as a host candidate since 2018, and it has been clear for several years now that the IOC would award Utah another version of the Games at some point.\n\nFor a time, the only realistic question was whether Salt Lake would host the Winter Games in 2030 or 2034.\n\nBid leaders said they would be open to either but preferred 2034 to allow for more of a cushion after the United States' hosting of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThe city is uniquely positioned as a host in part because it has meticulously maintained the venues that were used in 2002 through the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit created after those Games. Olympic officials also value Salt Lake City's reliable winter climate. Because of climate change, fewer cities can be counted upon to have the ideal weather for hosting the Winter Games during their usual scheduling slot in early to mid-February.\n\nWhat are the proposed venues for Salt Lake 2034?\n\nThe Salt Lake Games will use 12 existing venues, only four of which will require additional and permanent upgrades before 2034, according a report released in June by the IOC's future host commission. The only temporary venue that will need to be built is for snowboard big air.\n\nAs for the big-ticket items, the University of Utah's campus is expected to double as the Olympic village during the Games, and the Delta Center − home to the NBA's Utah Jazz − will host one of the Winter Olympics' marquee sports, figure skating. Skiing events will be held at Snowbasin Resort, about 35 minutes northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, and snowboarding events will be in Park City.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nHow much will Salt Lake City Olympics cost?\n\nKarl Stoss, chair of the future host commission for the Winter Games, has praised Salt Lake's plan for the Games as \"very compact\" and said it would require no capital investment.\n\nThe Salt Lake Games have an official budget of about $4 billion, and organizers claim they will be 100% privately funded − pulling money from ticket revenue, domestic sponsorships and an IOC contribution. The Olympics, however, have a habit of stretching beyond initial estimates. And they tend to put additional strain on public works and utilities in the host city, which is sometimes underestimated in budgets.\n\nWhich other bids did the U.S. beat out?\n\nFor decades, the IOC welcomed bids from multiple countries for one edition of the Games and essentially let them duke it out for votes. But that's not how it works anymore. The IOC's host selection process is far more amorphous, with potential hosts progressing through several loose stages of \"dialogue\" so that by the time they are put up for a vote, like Salt Lake City was Wednesday, the decision has essentially already been made.\n\nThat's all to say that it's not super-clear which bids, if any, Salt Lake City beat out. It was in the mix with the French Alps, Sweden and Switzerland for potential hosting duties, while Canada and Japan also expressed some level of interest. Ultimately, the IOC appears to have picked the French Alps and Salt Lake City from the bunch and then just figured out the timing of who would host when.\n\nWhere are the next Olympic Games?\n\nHere's a quick rundown of future Olympic hosts.\n\n2026 : Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy\n\n: Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy 2028: Summer Olympics in Los Angeles\n\nSummer Olympics in Los Angeles 2030: Winter Olympics in the French Alps\n\nWinter Olympics in the French Alps 2032: Summer Olympics in Brisbane, Australia\n\nSummer Olympics in Brisbane, Australia 2034: Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/11/12/reno-tahoe-winter-olympics-not-time-thanks/1979104002/", "title": "Reno-Tahoe to Winter Olympics: Not this time, thanks", "text": "Updated Nov. 12, 2018, 4:42 p.m. ET\n\nThe Reno Tahoe area was asked to submit a bid for an upcoming Winter Olympics, but has declined the invitation for now.\n\n“The potential for a near-term U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2030 would not be feasible financially for our region,” said a Monday morning statement from the Reno Tahoe Winter Games Coalition.\n\nThe move is not about the area’s ability to handle the games, said Jon Killoran of the RTWGC.

Officials previously announced an inclusive theme featuring a show inside the stadium, and the festivities stretched across the clusters of the Milano Cortina Games, including satellite ceremonies in Livigno and Predazzo. The parade of nations featured athletes from more than 90 countries around the world.\n\nU.S. speed skater Erin Jackson, one of two flag bearers and the defending gold medalist in the women's 500m, stepped out with a wide smile when the Americans entered the stadium as she waved the stars and stripes, her teammates falling in behind her. The American Olympians who walked in the parade of nations in Milan received cheers from the crowd of nearly 79,000 people. In Livigno, the crowd wasn't big, but there were some “USA” chants.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports is on the ground across Northern Italy to bring you live updates throughout these Games. Here are the highlights from the opening ceremony.\n\nTeam USA gets cheers, JD Vance gets boos at opening ceremony\n\nAs U.S. Olympians walked into the stadium in matching Ralph Lauren ensembles during the Parade of Nations, choruses of cheers rang out across the crowd of spectators, until U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, were shown on the stadium's Jumbotron. At the sight of Vance waving miniature American flags from the San Siro grandstand, the crowd booed loudly. — Cydney Henderson\n\nWho lit Olympic cauldrons at opening ceremony?\n\nCORTINA D'AMPEZZO — Italy turned to some of its greatest Alpine skiers, past and present, to light the two cauldrons for these Winter Games.\n\nThree-time Olympic champions Alberto Tomba and Deborah Compagnoni lit the cauldron in Milano while Sofia Goggia, who is seeking her second Olympic gold at these Games, lit the cauldron in Cortina.\n\nDespite the late hour, all three drew cheers and loud applause as they were raised on platforms to put the torches to the sun-like cauldrons, signalling that the Milano Cortina games are officially open.\n\nAfter a nearly three-hour ceremony at San Siro Stadium in Milano and the streets of Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo, the torch appeared on the streets of Milano. It was carried by Gerda Weissensteiner, a two-time Olympic medalist in luge, and Manuela di Centa, a seven-time medalist in cross-country skiing.\n\nThe torch was then handed off, physically to speedskater Enrico Fabris in Milano and virtually to Gustav Thoni, the 1972 Olympic champion in giant slalom. Both carried their torches a short distance before handing off to Tomba, Compagnoni and Goggia.\n\nThe cauldrons were designed to emulate Leonardo da Vinci's knot engravings, according to Olympic officials. da Vinci lived in Milan for 17 years of his renowned life. — Nancy Armour\n\nOrder of countries in Olympic opening ceremony\n\nThere are 92 countries in the Winter Olympics. Greece is always the first country in the parade of nations, the host country is always last. The second to last country is the next host of the Winter Games — France, in this case. The United States, who hosts the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, went third to last. The rest of the order was alphabetical based on the Italian spelling of the countries, which is why Saudi Arabia walked fourth; it's called Arabia Saudita in Italian.\n\nHow many US athletes in 2026 Olympics?\n\nThe U.S. team for the Milano Cortina Olympics has 232 athletes, its largest-ever for a Winter Olympics.\n\nWhat Charlize Theron said at opening ceremony\n\nCharlize Theron is at the opening ceremony as a U.N. peace ambassador. She delivered a call for peace: \"Let these Gmaes be more than just sport … but a resounding call for peace everywhere.\"\n\nWho carried Olympics flags?\n\nIn Milan, it's Japanese mathmatician and politician Tadatoshi Akiba; Brazilian gymnast and two-time gold medalist Rebeca Andrade; Nigerian poet and artist Maryam Bukar Hassan; Italian writer Nicolò Govoni; Italian diplomat Filippo Grandi; Kenyan long distance runner Eliud Kipchoge; Cameroonian boxer Cindy Ngamba and the well-known Tongan flag bearer Pita Taufatofua. In Livigno, it's Italian cross-country skier Franco Nones and Italian short-track speed skater Martina Valcepina.\n\nErin Jackson, Frank Del Duca as US flagbearers\n\nOlympic speedskating champion Erin Jackson and bobsledder Frank Del Duca were the flag bearers for Team USA's delegation at the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nJackson, who won gold in the women's 500 meters in Beijing in 2022, will be back to defend her title and compete in the 1,000 meters as well. This marks her third Olympic appearance.\n\n\"It'll definitely give me a lot of motivation, because just walking out into opening ceremonies even without carrying the flag, it's this amazing feeling of like, ‘OK, we're here. We're at the Olympics. We're surrounded by all these amazing people who have worked so hard to get to this point,'\" Jackson said Wednesday. \"Just even being in the opening ceremonies, that's just like the start of the games, but it's always just kind of like a breathtaking feeling. I think carrying the flag is just going to add to that, and I'm really looking forward to it.\"\n\nDel Duca – a sergeant in the U.S. Army stationed in Lake Placid, New York – made his Olympic Winter Games debut in Beijing, and has been in the sport for over a decade.

Coventry was elected in March 2025 to succeed Thomas Bach and is the first woman to be IOC president. A swimmer, Coventry represented Zimbabwe at five Olympics and won seven medals, two of them gold. She also swam at Auburn, leading the Tigers to NCAA titles in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Coventry became an IOC athlete member in 2013 and was elected as an individual member in 2021. — Nancy Armour\n\nAndrea Bocelli's opening ceremony performance\n\nOf course Andrea Bocelli has a role in the opening ceremony. It wouldn’t be a global sporting event without him.\n\nThe Italian tenor is singing while the torch relay makes its way through the San Siro Stadium on the way to the cauldron(s) being lit. It’s not known what Bocelli will be singing, but it’s a good bet it will be Nessun Dorma. The aria from Puccini’s opera Turandot was synonymous with the late Luciano Pavarotti, who Bocelli performed with as one of “The Three Tenors.” Since Pavarotti’s death, it’s become a signature of Bocelli’s.\n\nMongolia's opening ceremony outfits\n\nPlease give me a moment to pick up my jaw off the floor. Mongolia turned heads at the 2024 Paris Olympics with its intricate ceremonial garb and the country has earned flying colors yet again. Goyol Cashmere created a Mongolian deel that effortlessly merges Mongolia’s identity and heritage with traditional garments that still feel modern. The opening ceremony look is inspired by the Great Mongol Empire of the 13th and 15th centuries, “one of the most powerful periods in our nations history,” Goyol Cashmere explains. The outfit incorporates Mongolian cashmere, silk trim and embroidery for an ornate finish that is worthy of applause. — Cydney Henderson\n\nCheck out our full style guide to the Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nTeam Italy does Federica Brignone a solid\n\nBrignone was one of Italy’s flag bearers, and she led the contingent into Cortina while riding on one of her teammates’ shoulders. Brignone, the reigning overall champion in Alpine skiing, broke her leg in April, and is still recovering.\n\nAfter completing a downhill training run earlier in the day, Brignone said she was still in pain.\n\n“I'm still not 100%, I mean not even 80%,” she said. “But it is what it is, and I have no excuses. I will try to make my best.” — Nancy Armour\n\nMariah Carey's performance at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nMariah Carey is singing two songs during the opening ceremony. One, Nothing is Impossible, is one of Carey’s own. It’s from her “Here for It All” album, released last September.\n\nThe second, Nel blu dipinto di blu, is better known as Volare. C’mon! Sing it with me! “Volare, oh, oh. Contare, oh, oh, oh, oh.” The song, inspired by paintings by Marc Chagall, first came to fame as Italy’s entrant at the 1958 Eurovision contest. While it didn’t win, it was named Billboard’s Song of the Year and won song of the year and record of the year honors at the first-ever Grammys.\n\nPrior to Carey, the song has been covered by Dean Martin, David Bowie, Frank Sinatra, Barry White and the Gipsy Kings. — Nancy Armour\n\nIs Mariah Carey Italian?\n\nCarey's mother, an opera singer, is of Irish descent and her father African-American and Afro-Venezuelan.\n\nHow many athletes at Olympics?\n\nThere are 2,900 athletes at these Winter Games from 92 countries.\n\nLaura Pausini's opening ceremony performance of Italian national anthem\n\nGrammy winner Laura Pausini sung the Italian national anthem at the opening ceremony. Italy’s national anthem is “Il Canto degli Italiani,” which translates to “The Chant of the Italians.” Though Italians often refer to it as “Inno di Memeli,” after the author of its lyrics, or “Fratelli d’Italia,” which is how the anthem beings.\n\nThe anthem was written in 1847 and became popular during Italy’s fight for independence. It was adopted as Italy’s national anthem after World War II. — Nancy Armour\n\nIs Russia banned from Olympics?\n\nOfficially, Russia is banned from the Olympics because Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. At the Milano Cortina Games, there will be no Russian flags, no Russian anthems and no Russian national colors incoporated in the competition. (The same holds true for Belarus, which has supported Russia in the war.)\n\nBut there will be athletes with Russian and Belarussian passports competing as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" or AINs for short, if they meet specific conditions. That contingent will include 13 Russians and seven Belarussians, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Jan. 29.\n\nIf any of the AIN athletes were to win gold, a wordless anthem commissioned by the IOC would play. And none of the them will be allowed to participate in the Opening Ceremony Feb. 6. The IOC used the same procedure for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee, on the other hand, lifted its ban of Russia and Belarus in September, clearing both countries to return to the Paralympics wearing their names and colors. But not all sport federations have lifted their bans, while others did not lift them in time for athletes to qualify for Milano Cortina. As a result, the IPC said In October that it didn’t expect any athletes from the two countries at the 2026 Paralympics. — Nancy Armour\n\nWhy Shaun White was at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThree-time Olympic gold medalist Shaun White is a part of NBC's broadcast team for the opening ceremony, particularly the parade of nations portion. He went to five Winter Games — 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022 — and won gold in snowboard halfpipe in 2006, 2010 and 2018.\n\nHow long was Olympics opening ceremony?\n\nThe opening ceremony is expected to last about 2 hours and 45 minutes. The longest part is the parade of athletes, which is scheduled to take just over an hour and 3 minutes. There is also a 30-minute pre-show.\n\nWhy does Greece go first in opening ceremony parade of nations?\n\nGreece goes first in the Parade of Nations because it’s the birthplace of the Olympics, ancient and modern.\n\nThe Olympics were a regular occurrence for almost 12 centuries in ancient Greece. When Pierre de Coubertin decided to bring them back, he chose Athens as the first site of the modern Olympic Games, in 1896. — Nancy Armour\n\nWho is Eileen Gu?\n\nLIVIGNO, Italy — Eileen Gu’s first Olympics made her one of the most famous and recognizable in China. Not bad for somebody born and raised in the United States.\n\nAs Gu continues to sidestep citizenship questions, she enters these Games with three Olympic medals from Beijing 2022 (big air gold, halfpipe gold, slopestyle silver). She’s now the most successful women’s free skier ever, with 20 victories on the World Cup circuit. She also won at the inaugural Snow League event in China in December. Gu studies at Stanford and is also involved in the fashion industry, with modeling credits for Victoria’s Secret and Louis Vuitton. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nLindsey Vonn fans in Cortina as opening ceremony festivities pick up\n\nCORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — Eager spectators walk past window shops of internationally renowned fashion houses such as Valentino, Dior and Fendi along Corso Italia in Cortina. Base shakes bars and restaurants teeming with locals and those in town from all over the world for the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. They’re passing time with an assortment of wines and beers, reflecting on the day with about half an hour until the opens ceremony begins. Overheard from an American fan with two miniature flags sticking out of her collar musing over Lindsey Vonn’s miraculous downhill training run this afternoon post ACL rupture: “She was a superstar!” And to her naysayers?: “Everyone shut up.”\n\nJust outside the Olympic fan village, young children plant the Italian flag into a mount of hard, muddy snow that’s been cleared from the brick walkway for foot traffic.\n\nInflatables of Milo and Tina — the dual mascots of these Games representing Milano and Cortina — are set up and a popular photo pop spot for fans. Milo and Tina are brown and white stoats, also known as ermines, which belong to the weasel family.\n\nWhite neon light doodles of winter sports logos based in the Dolomites line Corso Italia along with flags representing the nations competing at these Games. — Payton Titus\n\nWhere are Winter Olympics 2026?\n\nThe Winter Olympics always sprawl, because of the need for mountains. But the Milano Cortina Games are the most geographically spread out in Olympic and Paralympic history, with a footprint just slightly smaller than the entire state of New Jersey.\n\nMost of the indoor events – hockey, speed skating, short-track speedskating and figure skating — are going to be in Milano. For the mountain events, however, organizers are making use of venues already used for World Cups and world championships in Cortina, Livigno and Bormio. — Nancy Armour\n\nLivigno opening ceremony\n\nLIVIGNO, Italy — There was a host, a DJ playing “Forever Young,” Olympic mascots and a sizable crowd already filing into Livigno Snow Park for this town’s own little satellite opening ceremony, which included skiers and snowboarders from the mountain clusters Livigno and Bormio sites.The ceremony took place in the infield of the venue, which is at the base of the hills for the halfpipe and big air snowboarding and freestyle skiing competitions. — Gentry Estes\n\nWhat sports are in the Winter Olympics?\n\nThe 2026 Milano Cortina Games feature 16 sports.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2017/08/04/1-000-words-has-door-opened-potential-reno-tahoe-winter-olympics/539625001/", "title": "Has door opened for potential Reno-Tahoe Winter Olympics?", "text": "Reno Gazette-Journal\n\nAug. 4, 2017 Updated Jan. 11, 2018, 4:04 p.m. ET\n\nReno Gazette-Journal columnist Chris Murray has been known to be a bit wordy, so we're giving him 1,000 words (no more than that) to share his thoughts from the week that was in the world of sports.\n\n* HERE’S A QUOTE FROM 2003 ABOUT Reno-Tahoe potentially hosting the 2012 Olympics: “Our chances are very good to become the next American region to host the Winter Olympic Games. Nobody else is as strong as us.” That was Jim Vanden Heuvel, then-president of the Reno-Tahoe Winter Games Coalition. A decade and a half later, the dream is still alive. And a decade and a half from now, Reno-Tahoe hopes to be hosting the Winter Games. This week’s news that Los Angeles would host the 2028 Summer Olympics appeared to be a death knell for Reno-Tahoe’s quest for the 2030 Olympics (the ICO hasn’t given the same country back-to-back Olympics since Nazi Germany in 1936). But John Killoran, the Reno-Tahoe Winter Games Coalition’s CEO, believes the Los Angeles Games development to be a positive one for a local bid.\n\n* THE USOC HAD ALREADY DECIDED to pass on the on a 2026 Winter Games bid and focus on the Summer Olympics, which it just landed with L.A. Killoran believes with priority No. 1 for the USOC accomplished, Reno-Tahoe now has a legitimate chance at a 2030 bid (the USOC is unlikely to push for the 2026 Winter Games because it would take the luster off 2028 in L.A.). “The bottom line is we now have a window that opens a timeline, albeit 13 years from now, where we might as early as 2030 bring the Winter Games to the United States and hopefully to Reno-Tahoe,” Killoran said. The 2030 site won’t be selected by the USOC until 2023, with a domestic bid likely picked in 2021, but it at least provides an alleyway.\n\n* THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR A RENO-TAHOE Olympics was to partner with Sacramento and potentially the Bay Area. Now, it seems much more likely it would be a Nevada-oriented Games with Las Vegas stepping into the fray as co-host. Killoran said the IOC has recently put more emphasis on regions hosting the Olympics rather than one specific metro area. Las Vegas has the hotel rooms and arenas to help the pitch. “The IOC’s agenda 2020 seems to be more accommodating to more spread out venue plans to keep costs down,” Killoran said. “When you have a city like Las Vegas with four arenas (T-Mobile, Thomas & Mack, MGM, the Orleans) on one avenue within three miles of each other, that’s something you don’t see in most cities around the world. To be able to potentially bring a Games that would benefit our entire state and its two population areas, it’s something we have to look at.”\n\n* RENO-TAHOE STILL SEEMS LIKE A long shot to ever land the Olympics. History would indicate it’s not happening in 2030 because of its close proximity to Los Angeles, which is only 270 miles from Las Vegas. The IOC has preferred to spread the Games around the world. The same country has been awarded back-to-back Olympics only three times – France in 1924, the United States in 1932 and Germany in 1936. The IOC would have to break from a century of precedent to give back-to-back Olympics to cities a relative stone’s throw away, but Killoran sees that trend changing. “As we move forward in the Olympic bid process, I think the way things have been bid out in the past have gone by the wayside,” Killoran said. “If you go back to the dawn of the Winter Olympics, they were actually regularly held in pre-World War II in the same country. I’m not sure something like that is as much of an obstacle as it has been in the past.”\n\n* AFTER SOME PUBLIC PUSHES IN THE past, the Reno-Tahoe Winter Games Coalition has been fairly quiet in recent years. That’s been by design. The USOC requested potential Winter Games hosts to work silently as it tried to land a Summer Games first. Meanwhile, Killoran said his organization has worked to raise revenue and show competence in hosting large events in Nevada. Las Vegas has held three major curling events in the last four years, Reno hosts the National Junior Olympic Cross Country championships in 2018 and Squaw Valley held a World Cup ski event this year. The Reno-Tahoe Winter Games Coalition has essentially worked as a state sports commission. “That allows us to create revenue and stay as a business while keeping the bigger dream afloat that we can submit a bid,” Killoran said.\n\n* HOSTING THE OLYMPICS WOULD undeniably be the coolest moment in local sports history (Squaw Valley hosted the Games in 1960) – as long as the price is right. I railed against Las Vegas’ Boondoggle Stadium given the taxpayer burden, so it'd be disingenuous to ignore the potential public burden with an Olympics. Hosting the Games would only make sense if it didn't plunge the state into tremendous debt, and hosting the Olympics tend to be good at doing that (see Rio). Killoran said the state has a lot of the structures necessary already in place – the opening and closing ceremonies, for example, could be at the Raiders’ new stadium. “The United States, without sounding cocky for the country, has run some of the most successful financial Games, and you certainly don’t hear any of the U.S. Games ever on the list of Games that didn’t do so well financially,” Killoran said. “The United States has a great track record of doing so larger through private partnerships.”\n\n* WITH A SUMMER GAMES SECURED, the USOC can now focus on landing its first Winter Games since Salt Lake hosted in 2002. Domestically, Salt Lake would be Reno-Tahoe’s top challenger for a 2030 bid, if the USOC chooses to make one (Lake Placid and Denver also have shown interest in the past). Internationally, most of the competition will come from Europe. Killoran said internal polling has shown locals are “really positive” about Reno-Tahoe hosting the Olympics. The odds of Nevada hosting a Games still seem low. The region has, in some form, shown interest in the 2012, 2016, 2022 and 2026 Games without getting much traction. But enough passionate people are still making the push that it’s not an impossibility. “I’ve worked with enough people and stakeholders who have put in so much effort and it’s all because as a whole we believe in it,” Killoran said. “There’s an appetite and a hunger and a desire from a lot of people. We’re still an extremely viable and a very attractive Winter Olympic venue.”\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.

So it’s not a surprise that Vermont has played an important role in the development of winter sports. For a small state, Vermont can claim many firsts.\n\nThe first winter carnival in the United States was held at Vermont Academy in 1909. The Dartmouth Winter Carnival is based on the Vermont Academy event and this year marks the 108th carnival at Dartmouth. The first United States National Skiing Championships consisting of cross country and jumping were held in Brattleboro in 1924. The first ski lift in the United States was a rope tow on Gilbert’s Hill in Woodstock.\n\nBoth the National Ski Patrol and the legendary 10th Mountain Division trace their beginnings to Vermont. The first U. S. National Snowboarding Championship was held at Suicide Six in 1982 although it was actually called “Snow Surfing” at that time. Founded in 1970, Burke Mountain Academy was the first winter sports academy in the U.S.\n\nVermont winter athletes have also gained international acclaim. Andrea Mead Lawrence was the best woman skier of her era garnering two gold medals at the 1952 Winter Olympics. Billy Kidd was the first United States man to win an Olympic medal in alpine skiing and Bill Koch was the first in Nordic skiing. In snowboarding, Ross Powers and Kelly Clark were the first Americans to win Olympic gold.\n\nBirth of the Vermont Ski Museum\n\nRoy Newton is a Vermont editor and publisher who currently lives in Castleton and publishes the Lakeside News and Rutland Sun. But in the 1980s he was the publisher of the Vermont Ski News. Newton traveled around the state collecting news, soliciting ads, and distributing the paper.\n\nOne day driving towards Burlington from Montpelier, he decided Vermont with all its skiing history should have its own ski museum. He came to this decision with such conviction that he turned his car around, returned to Montpelier, and registered the name Vermont Ski Museum with the state.\n\nThat was in 1988. Newton set the museum up as a nonprofit, which meant it required a board of directors. He called upon some of those who had supported his Vermont Ski News as advertisers which included Chuck and Jann Perkins, founders of the Alpine Shop in South Burlington.\n\nNewton in his travels around the state began collecting retired ski gear, equipment, machinery, signs, library materials and other skiing memorabilia, but where to store them? Newton was also working at the Brandon Inn and secured the use of a shed behind the inn. So the first physical museum was located in Brandon down a muddy alley behind the Brandon Inn. Visitation was by appointment only and the collection was not stored in an organized fashion.\n\nChuck and Jann remember that board meetings were informal, usually over lunch somewhere in Killington. Fundraising was always a challenge. They ran various events around the Killington area including a wet T-shirt contests at the Wobbly Barn. Eventually they were able to secure a location for the museum on U.S. 4 between Rutland and Pico near the Cortina Inn. While this seemed like a good location, traffic whizzing by wasn’t that interested in stopping for a museum.\n\nChuck and Jann lobbied for the museum to move to Stowe particularly if a location in the village was available. It would be easier for the museum to attract pedestrian traffic than automobiles traveling 50 miles per hour. Which brings us to ...\n\nHistory of Town Meeting House\n\nThe Town Meeting House in Stowe was built in 1818 and is the oldest active public building. The meeting house originally occupied the lot on North Main Street where the Stowe Community Church now stands. The meeting house was to be used as a church for all religious groups and as a town house for various civic meetings. For more than 40 years various denominations worshipped in this common church building until they erected their individual churches.\n\nIn 1861 the Universalists obtained the land where the meeting house sat. To make room for their church (which would become the Stowe Community Church in 1920), the meeting house was moved by a team of oxen to its current location on South Main Street. By the 1890s it was used as the Town Hall and gymnasium.\n\nWhen the Akeley Memorial Building was built in the early 1900s it became the Town Hall, but the old meeting house remained the home for various town services. This included the Stowe Fire Department, which used the building until 1973.\n\nThe Stowe Water and Light Department, which was the last remaining town agency in the old meeting house, left the building in 2000. The town of Stowe was left with the decision of what to do with the old meeting house. The building was condemned and costly repairs would be required to restore it for useful purposes, but it was an historic part of Stowe.\n\nBringing the museum to Stowe\n\nA group of Stowe business persons including Chuck and Jann Perkins saw the old Town Meeting House as an opportunity. In order to preserve an historic building, why not use it to preserve a significant segment of Vermont’s history? A museum would provide another village attraction that could draw visitors and help business. The group negotiated with Roy Newton and purchased his collection along with the associated rights.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nHistory of Mount Mansfield Ski Patrol\n\nEpic history of Stowe Mountain Resort\n\nNext they launched a $1.4 million campaign to save the condemned Town Meeting House as the home of the new Vermont Ski Museum. Managed by volunteers throughout the state, the campaign reunited Vermont ski racers, 10th Mountain Division members, area developers, self-professed ski bums and industry pioneers. The Perkins’s played a significant role in the campaign. As Chuck tells it, he had just sold one of their Stowe properties when he found out that the campaign had decided the renovated museum building would be named for top level donor. Chuck came home and told Jann, “I gave the money from the house away.”\n\nThanks to the Perkins’s and many others who contributed, the goal was reached and renovations began. Much of the building’s structure had to be restored and even the old bell tower which had been removed years before was restored. One new addition was a giant moving mobile to display the museum’s historic ski lift exhibit.\n\nThe Vermont Ski Museum opened its doors in the restored Town Meeting House which was now the “Charles N. and Janet B. Perkins Building” on Aug. 16, 2002. Double gold medalist Andrea Mead Lawrence cut the ribbon at the grand opening.\n\nIn 2010 the museum’s name was changed to the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum to recognize the impact Vermont and Vermonters have had on the development of snowboarding.\n\nThe museum today\n\nThe museum’s mission statement is “to Collect, Preserve, and Celebrate Vermont’s Skiing and Snowboarding history!”\n\nSince 2002, the museum collection has more than doubled. There are approximately 8,000 individual items preserved by the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum. Ski equipment includes about 275 pairs of boots, 400 pairs of skis, 100 pairs of poles, 55 pairs of climbing skins, and 60 loose bindings for both cross country and downhill skiing, and the carrying equipment — bags, boot trees, and ski racks.\n\nMechanical equipment, the smallest collection at about 75, includes large items necessary for the operations of ski areas such as snow making equipment, lifts, communication equipment, and race timing devices. Most of this is the first timing equipment, including the first electronic eye that starts and stops timing based on motion, used in Vermont, perhaps in the United States.\n\nVermont Ski Areas collection contains location-specific items. There have been over 130 ski areas in Vermont. Items range from trail signs to ashtrays to chandeliers. The 10th Mountain Division collection includes early fleece, climbing equipment, WWII rations, medals, and archival material. The fine art collection holds original paintings, drawings, and sculpture and posters and graphics by Vermonters or of Vermont locations and events. The library and archives represents a large portion of the museum’s holdings, including over 550 books, 350 magazines, 75 postcards, 50 instructional booklets, 200 pamphlets related to Vermont ski areas and some original photography and film footage.\n\n“Curious & Cool,’ the museum’s current exhibit, features an eclectic mix from 30 years of collecting: from one of Andrea Mead Lawrence’s gold medals to moon boots; from Mount Mansfield ticket books to one of Warren Witherell’s water skis. The museum plans a new main exhibit every year, but maintains several permanent exhibits. The 10th Mountain Division exhibit salutes those Vermonters who served in the 10th during World War II. The National Ski Patrol exhibit tells the story of how its roots can be traced back to Vermont.\n\nVermont Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame\n\nThe museum also hosts the Vermont Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame. A selection committee nominates a set of candidates each year and welcomes suggestions from the public. A special induction event is held each year to welcome those selected. Andrea Mead Lawrence was the first inductee in 2002.\n\nVermonters in the WWII 10th Mountain Division were inducted in 2003. Other notable inductees include Billy Kidd and the Cochran family in alpine skiing; Bill Koch and Martha Rockwell in Nordic skiing; Jake Burton, Donna Carpenter and Ross Powers in snowboarding.\n\nThe Hall of Fame also includes the Paul Robbins Journalism Award to recognize Vermonters who have distinguished themselves writing about and covering winter sports. This past year the award went to Vermont icon Peter Miller.\n\nIn 2017 a new award was added to the Hall of Fame. The “First Tracks Award” honors exceptional and ongoing contributions to skiing or snowboarding in Vermont by someone under 35. The First Tracks Award is given in memory of Ian Graddock, a Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum board member, lifelong skier and ski racer, who passed away in 2016 at age 35.\n\nIn its inaugural year, the First Tracks Award went to snowboarder Kevin Pearce, who was on a trajectory to snowboard in the 2010 Olympics when he crashed and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Since then, he’s gone on to set up the Love Your Brain Foundation to help others with TBIs.\n\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame event, the museum sponsors other events throughout the year. In the past these have included antique ski races in both Alpine and Nordic disciplines. This year the museum has held a series of panel discussions called “Thirsty Thursdays.” These events are co-sponsored by Vermont Ski & Ride Magazine, Collective Arts Brewing, and Hetta. The next Thirsty Thursday entitled “Snowboarding – Past, Present, and Future” will be held on March 8 at the museum.\n\n2018 – A special year\n\n2018 marks the 30th anniversary of what started as the Vermont Ski Museum. It marks the 16th year that the museum has been in Stowe. And it marks the 200th anniversary for the old Town Meeting House that is now the home for the museum. We hope you’ll plan a visit to the museum to help us celebrate these milestones and celebrate Vermont’s skiing and snowboarding history!\n\nMeredith Scott is curator of the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum.

He spent time with his family and trained at Larry Robbins' indoor ice rink in Alpine.\n\nAgostino's goals were to stay in shape before joining the United States hockey team at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing — and avoid COVID.\n\nAgostino was invited to join Team USA the night before Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod was scheduled to play a Russian Kontinental Hockey League game against HC Sochi. He got a call from USA Hockey general manager John Vanbiesbrouck, timed perfectly since Sochi had hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It's definitely a moment and a phone call I don't think I'll ever forget,\" said Agostino, a 29-year-old left wing. \"I absolutely love the Olympics, too. ... As a kid growing up, my three biggest dreams in hockey were to win the Frozen Four, which I was fortunate enough to accomplish (at Yale); to win a Stanley Cup — unfortunately, that didn't happen — and to go to the Olympics, which is definitely a dream come true.\"\n\nFrom New Jersey to the Olympics\n\nAgostino joked the New Jersey Colonials \"own me,\" having played in their system from Mites to age 18. Agostino was part of three NJSIAA titles at Delbarton, and graduated in 2010 as the school's all-time leading scorer, with 50 goals and 33 assists as a senior.\n\nOriginally drafted by Pittsburgh in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, Agostino was part of a blockbuster trade to Calgary leading up to the 2013 Frozen Four with Yale. He helped Yale win the NCAA title as a junior — the school's first in any team sport — then turned pro after his senior season, signing a two-year contract with the Flames.\n\nAgostino made his NHL debut on March 21, 2014, but appeared in only 10 games with the Flames. Agostino believes he was \"typecast in the NHL as more of a bottom-six forward,\" totaling eight goals and 22 assists in 86 starts with Calgary, St. Louis, Boston, Montreal, and the Devils.\n\nAgostino was named the AHL MVP after an 83-point season with the Chicago Wolves in 2016-17 as a member of the Blues organization, but his production dropped off with Boston's AHL affiliate the following year.\n\nAgostino signed a one-year deal with the Torpedo in June, then extended his contract for a second season on Dec. 28.\n\nWith 20 goals and 20 assists in 46 games for the Torpedo, Agostino ranks 14th in the KHL in points — the No. 2 American in the league.\n\n\"I'm not grateful I was only playing that role, but grateful in the sense it showed other areas of my game I could do well,\" Agostino said. \"I love scoring goals. There's nothing like scoring goals. I hope that's something I'm asked to do with this team.\"\n\nBuilding Team USA\n\nMost of the national team gathered Sunday in Los Angeles for a couple of practices before flying to Beijing. Everyone in the traveling party was required to test negative for COVID twice in a row during the three days in L.A.\n\nUSA Hockey arrived in China the morning of the Opening Ceremony. Agostino was able to walk with his teammates.\n\n\"That'll be a really cool thing to be a part of,\" Agostino said. \"That's pretty special in itself.\"\n\nNew Jersey and the 2022 Winter Games: A complete list of Olympians with Garden State ties\n\nUSA Hockey: Long Valley goaltender Tyler Muszelik earning his place in development program\n\nThe Americans open against host China on Feb. 10, then will play prelims against Canada and Germany, followed by a qualification playoff on Feb. 15. Quarterfinals will be Feb. 16 and semis on Feb. 18. The bronze-medal game is Feb. 19. The gold medal will be determined Feb. 20.\n\nThe United States has only won men's ice hockey gold twice: in 1980 following the so-called \"Miracle on Ice\" defeat of the Soviet Union in a semifinal, and 1960. The Americans have not won a medal since a silver in 2010.\n\n\"We're excited about the mix, a great blend of youth and experience,\" USA Hockey coach David Quinn said. \"The challenges are, you're throwing 25 guys together in a short period of time, and trying to become a cohesive unit in a quick, small window. ... This is a lifetime opportunity for all our players and everybody involved in the Olympics. USA Hockey has never had a deeper player pool. We feel very confident we've got an opportunity to win a gold medal.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Agostino has worn a USA jersey. However, it will be his first international experience in red, white and blue. Agostino was invited to play a two-game series with the Under-18 national team at the University of Maine during his senior year at Delbarton. When at Yale, Agostino was part of the last set of cuts prior to the World Junior Championships.\n\n\"I don't think anything can compare to the feeling I'm sure I'll get during the Olympics. It'll be a pretty special one for sure,\" Agostino said. \"I want to win a gold medal, plain and simple. That's what everyone's goal is. That's our team goal.\"\n\nAgostino's golden dream became more realistic on Dec. 22, when the NHL announced its players would not participate in the Olympics. The league had planned an Olympic break, but was forced to reschedule dozens of games due to COVID outbreaks.\n\nOnly six of the American Olympians have NHL experience, including Agostino. The average age is 25.1 years, the youngest since 1994. Fifteen of the Americans are currently playing college hockey.\n\n\"It's perfect for his game: playing on a bigger sheet, having an opportunity to puck possess and make plays, play with your hair on fire a little bit, rather than playing every shift is life or death,\" Delbarton coach Bruce Shatel said. \"In the Olympics, he's going to have a ton of pressure to perform for your country, but he's not going to worry about being re-signed, or to play in your next game. I think you're going to see great things from him at the Games.\"\n\nJane Havsy is a storyteller for the Daily Record and DailyRecord.com, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.

This is No. 10.\n\nFor Eric Heiden, one of those in the crowd at Field House International Ice Rink in Lake Placid, New York, during one of the most famous sporting events in American history, the \"Miracle on Ice\" game was perhaps an even greater benefit than a transcendent moment in American sports.\n\nFor one thing, there was the celebration that followed — Heiden famously got back to his room late and slept through his alarm clock the following day, meaning he got a late start on his own date with history.\n\nFor another, it meant the 1980 Olympics wouldn't be remembered as the Eric Heiden Olympics. Yes, he was on his way to winning his fifth gold medal, achieving something no Winter Olympian had done before. Yes, the Madison native was speedskating royalty, basically a rock star in Norway and the Netherlands, countries that held speedskating in high regard. Yes, he established Olympic records in all five of his races. But Heiden didn't want to be a celebrity and made that fact abundantly clear during those Olympics.\n\n\"I don't want people following me around, putting me on a pedestal,\" Heiden said then. \"I just want to be Eric Heiden.\"\n\nWhen the average person thinks of the 1980 Olympics, they think of the United States beating the Soviet Union in hockey. But what the 21-year-old achieved was too special to simply fall below the radar.\n\nWhen the athletes were visiting the White House following the Olympics, Representative Frank Annunzio of Illinois was quoted as saying Heiden's performance \"ranks with Babe Ruth's 60 home runs, Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game and the ground-gaining records of O.J. Simpson and Jim Brown. In fact, it ranks with every accomplishment in sports.\"\n\nA high five\n\nThe 10,000 meters wasn't Heiden's best event, but all eyes were on him at the James B. Sheffield Olympic Skating Rink on Feb. 23, 1980. Heiden was one of the biggest Olympics storylines heading into the games, where fans and media were already wondering if he could capture five gold medals. After winning the 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 5,000, the stage was now set for history.\n\nTalk of an unprecedented fifth medal intensified when Heiden won the first gold in the 500, an unpredictable sprint race and again not one of Heiden's signature events. In fact, he'd been upset by another 21-year-old named Tom Plant of West Allis in that event at the World Sprint Speed Skating Championships earlier in February, even though Heiden cruised to the overall sprints title.\n\nHeiden was paired with the USSR's Evgeni Kulikov, the world-record holder in the 500 and gold medalist at the 1976 Olympics. But Heiden edged Kulikov by two-tenths of a second and established the first of his five Olympic records with a time of 38.03 seconds.\n\n\"I am very happy to have won a gold medal, but the most important thing to me is that I skated a good race,\" Heiden said. \"It is nice to be paired with Kulikov because throughout the race, I know where I stand.\n\n\"There is a lot of pressure on me right now, but since winning this race, I am a lot more relaxed. I feel I can cope better with the pressure after today.\"\n\nIn the 5,000 meters, Heiden struck gold again with a time of 7:02.29, fighting through the wind and snow that kept him short of his goal of 7 minutes even. Speedskating wasn't moved indoors until the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary.\n\n\"Did I think I could beat Heiden?\" said Kai Arne Stenshjemmet, who took second place in the 5K. \"Well ... to tell you the truth, no. Nobody thinks he can beat him. He is the greatest skater that has ever been. I know him well. He is my friend. I often wonder what makes him so good.\"\n\nIn the 1,000, Heiden won in 1:15.18.\n\nStenshjemmet, who hailed from Norway where songs had been written about Heiden and he'd appeared on milk cartons as a celebrity, appeared to have an inside track on the 1,500 meters title when Heiden slipped. Heiden nonetheless caught himself and registered 1:55.44 for yet another Olympic record.\n\n\"I thought nothing when Heiden slipped,\" said Stenshjemmet. \"You think nothing when Heiden slips because you know it will not matter.\"\n\n\"Sometimes a slip can cost you dearly – time wise it cost me about two-tenths of a second, but mentally, it didn't cost me anything,\" Heiden said. \"A slip can often make you tighten up, but the whole incident passed pretty fast and I didn't think about it again.\"\n\nHeiden's fourth gold tied him with the Soviet Union's Lidia Skoblikova, who won four in 1964, for the most golds in a single Winter Olympics. One gold remained.\n\nA late start to immortality\n\nKnocks came at Heiden's door at roughly 7:40 a.m.; he'd been scheduled to rise more than an hour earlier.\n\nIt wouldn't matter, although Heiden said he was scared when he saw early skaters like Norway's Tom Oxholm and South Milwaukee native Mike Woods surpass the previous Olympic record in the 10,000 meters.\n\n\"I didn't expect the times to be as fast as they were today and after seeing Woods and Oxholm, I was scared,\" Heiden said. \"Conditions didn't seem that good for a world record.\"\n\nHeiden was paired with Russia's Viktor Leskin, who went out at breakneck pace.\n\n\"I was concerned whether to attack and go after (Leskin),\" Heiden said. \"I started to, but Dianne (Holum, his coach) said, 'Relax, skate your own race.'\"\n\nHeiden's time was 14:28.13. It was a whopping 6.2 seconds better than the previous world record and 15 seconds better than Heiden's previous best.\n\nFans chanted \"Er-ic\" as he rounded the oval, and some skaters still had yet to compete when Heiden began talking to reporters in a victory press conference.\n\n\"I thought I could win one or two, but I thought five was out of the question,\" Heiden said. \"This is the best race I could have won. I skated well and gave it all I had. It's a neat race to win because it's so long and everyone in it has trained and worked so hard. The last five laps, you think you know how tired you are and how nice it will be to stand up again.\"\n\nStaying out of the spotlight\n\nJust don't expect Heiden to be impressed with the medals.\n\n\"I'd rather get a nice warmup suit or something,\" Heiden said at the time. \"Then I could use it. The medals don't mean that much. The effort I put into the races is what's important. The medals will probably sit where all the rest are, in my mom's dresser, gathering dust.\"\n\nHeiden's best finish at the 1976 Olympics as a 17-year-old was seventh place in the 1,500 meters, but he suddenly achieved dominance when he won the world championships in 1977, becoming the first American man to win that title since 1891. Heiden repeated the feat in 1978 and 1979, with some World Sprint titles and Junior Worlds crowns to accompany.\n\nHis sister, Beth Heiden, was also a world renown speedskater who endured frustration in Lake Placid, finishing out of the medals in three races before capturing bronze. In the post-race press conference, she tearfully chastised media for their preoccupation with medals. During the games, local print news outlets were critical of family members for remaining unavailable, and the Heidens hired 33-year-old agent/lawyer Arthur Kaminsky to facilitate (or forbid) interaction between the family and the press.\n\nThe media had another interesting quandary on their hands after Heiden won his fifth gold just before ABC began broadcasting at 11:30 a.m. Announce the results or wait for a primetime broadcast? It was a similar issue that faced ABC the day before with the U.S. hockey team's win.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to give you the highlights now, but the basic responsibility of a primary source of news is to let you know what's going on,\" ABC's Jim McKay said. \"So in this case, I'm going to tell you — Eric did it.\"\n\nIt wasn't a decision everyone loved, but it was a second straight day in which a prominent Wisconsin athlete achieved remarkable Olympic success.\n\n\"If I looked at myself I would probably say that I am a very driven person to the point of almost being selfish,\" Heiden said years later when ESPN SportsCentury identified him as the No. 46 greatest American athlete of the 20th century. \"I wasn't around for birthdays or Christmas. Maybe I'm one of the ultimate hedonists, I don't know. I like doing the things I like to do and have a hard time compromising.\"\n\nHow the moment lives on\n\nTrue to the sentiments he expressed, Heiden moved away from the spotlight after his incredible run, pursuing medical school. He had started his schooling at the University of Wisconsin-Madison but transferred to Stanford. Today, he's an orthopedic surgeon in Park City, Utah.\n\nCounty Executive William O'Donnell tried to honor the Heidens by suggesting to Gov. Lee Dreyfus that the Olympic ice rink at State Fair Park be renamed in honor of the Heidens; instead, the outdoor venue was replaced by the Pettit National Ice Center in 1993. It's the center where many other speedskating luminaries like Bonnie Blair, Dan Jansen and Shani Davis trained for their own Olympics experiences.\n\nHeiden hasn't remained a highly public figure since his sports days, but no winter Olympian has matched his feat of five golds in a single Olympics yet.\n\nWisconsin gold\n\nHeiden won his fifth gold medal one day after Wisconsinites Mark Johnson and Bob Suter won gold with the Miracle on Ice team.

Olympic history is next", "text": "Jan. 29, 2026 Updated Feb. 2, 2026, 8:08 p.m. ET\n\nSpeedskater Jordan Stolz has dominated the sport since the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\nStolz could potentially win four gold medals at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nHis success is attributed to a combination of strong technique and a heavy weight training program.\n\nStolz holds the world record in the 1,000-meter and has swept the sprint distances at recent world championships.\n\nMILWAUKEE – Jordan Stolz was too quiet.\n\nHe’d taken an iPad to his room, and it was well past the time when he should have come back out with it. Stolz and older sister Hannah weren’t allowed on screens much and, when they were, it was for a limited amount of time.\n\nStolz’s father, Dirk, figured his son was playing games or watching videos. Instead, when he entered Stolz’s room, he found his son staring intently at the screen, rewinding something over and over.\n\nIt was a clip of Russian speed skater Pavel Kulizhnikov, who’d just set the world record in the 500-meter.\n\n“He said, 'I’m trying to figure out how to get the world record,’” Dirk Stolz recalled to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nStolz was not yet 12.\n\nA decade later, Stolz not only has a world record – he broke Kulizhnikov’s previous mark in the 1,000-meter in 2024 – he has an almost unbreakable hold on men’s speed skating.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nHe has won every 1,000- and 1,500-meter race this World Cup season, and five of the nine 500-meter races. This after he swept the sprint distances at the world championships in 2023 and 2024, and won the season title at all three distances last season.\n\nAfter putting the mass start back on his international schedule for the first time since junior worlds in 2023, Stolz finished on the podium in two of the first four World Cups, including a win in Hamar, Norway, in December.\n\nStay healthy, and Stolz could leave the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics in Italy with four gold medals, etching himself into Olympic history. Only Eric Heiden has won more medals at a single Winter Games, famously winning five as he swept the speed skating events at the 1980 Games in Lake Placid, New York.\n\nNorwegian biathlon great Ole Einar Bjørndalen (2002) and Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova (1964) are the only other athletes to win four golds at a single Winter Olympics.\n\n“Sometimes you just sit back and realize what level you're actually on and it's kind of amazing,” Stolz told USA TODAY Sports. “I don't want to say too much about it, because you want to try and keep realistic. So I just focus on what's ahead.\n\n“But if you look at all the stuff that has been done, it's kind of large.”\n\nJordan Stolz's Olympic journey began on backyard pond\n\nStolz grew up in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, a northwest exurb of Milwaukee. He and Hannah were captivated watching Apolo Anton Ohno at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010, and begged their parents to let them try speed skating.\n\nThere’s a pond on the family’s property, so Dirk Stolz cleared off a 30-yard straightaway.\n\n“It was fun for them to go crashing into the snowbank,” Dirk Stolz said.\n\nThat straightaway soon became a full oval, and Dirk Stolz added lights so the kids could keep skating after it got dark.\n\n“They were down there all the time,” he said.\n\nWhen it was clear this wasn’t a passing fad, Jane and Dirk Stolz looked for a speed skating club for their children. Which isn’t hard to find in Wisconsin, long the epicenter for the sport in the United States.\n\nGet our Chasing Gold Olympics newsletter in your inbox for coverage of your favorite Team USA athletes\n\nHeiden, Bonnie Blair, Dan Jansen, Shani Davis – all either grew up in Wisconsin and/or trained at what is now the Pettit National Ice Center in West Allis, 10 minutes west of downtown Milwaukee.\n\nIt was at the Pettit that Stolz and his sister caught the eye of Bob Fenn, Davis’ coach.\n\n“Bobby comes up to me and Jane and was like, 'I want to coach your kids. Your kids have such a work ethic. They’re such go-getters,’” Dirk Stolz said.\n\nGiven their kids’ enthusiasm for the sport, the Stolzes decided to go all-in. The kids began homeschooling so they could train. Jane and Dirk Stolz alternated their work schedules, Jane on the day shift, Dirk on the night shift, so there would always be someone available to make the 45-minute drive to the Pettit Center. They turned competitions into mini-vacations, staying at hotels with water parks.\n\nThough Hannah Stolz stopped speed skating as a teenager, Jordan Stolz became even more committed.\n\n“The technique aspect and constantly being able to improve and go faster,” Stolz said of why he loves the sport. “The feeling of hitting a turn at 40 miles per hour, you can't get that feeling doing anything else.”\n\nAfter Fenn died unexpectedly in 2017, Davis coached Stolz for about a year. But when Davis left to train China’s speed skaters, the then-14-year-old called Bob Corby, who had once coached Jansen and Blair.\n\nCorby, a physical therapist, had treated Stolz for a pulled hip flexor two years earlier.\n\n“He said, 'I don’t have a coach. Would you please coach me?’” Corby said.\n\nNew coach, new regimen changes career trajectory\n\nStolz has always had great technique, as well as an ability to instantaneously make corrections. He is obsessive about getting better. When Jane Stolz would record her son's races on her phone, he'd immediately grab it afterward to search for where he could save a millisecond or two.\n\nUntil he started training with Corby, however, Stolz had done minimal offseason training. Biking mostly. (He was only 14, after all.) So Corby developed a strength training program for Stolz, one that emphasizes heavy weight training.\n\n“When I was coaching in the early ‘80s, we could skate technically better than everyone in the world, but we couldn’t beat them,” Corby said. “It occurred to me, we weren’t strong enough.”\n\nThe stronger a speed skater is in the thighs and glutes, the more power they can generate and the faster they will go. Heiden was famous for his lower-body strength, running or skate-walking with a sandbag on his shoulders to build up his leg muscles.\n\nThe exact amount Stolz lifts in the offseason is something of a trade secret, but suffice to say even Olympic weightlifters would be impressed. Pair that with pristine technique, and you have a speed machine.\n\n“I’ve never seen anybody generate speed like he does,” Corby said. “He’s got extremely strong legs. Then, when you add really, really good technique that puts power into the ice, it’s a really good combination.”\n\nThough COVID wiped out what would have been their first competitive season together, it gave Stolz more time to get stronger.\n\n“That’s when he really took off,” Corby said.\n\nAt the U.S. championships in January 2021, Stolz won the 500-meter. He was 16. He made his first Olympic team the next year, finishing 13th in the 500-meter and 14th in the 1,000-meter at the Beijing Games.\n\nBut the experience was invaluable. The 17-year-old was on his own at those Games, with neither Corby nor his family able to go because of the strict COVID protocols. He didn’t really know how to manage jet lag, and didn’t bring any of his own food with him.\n\n“This time around, I think I'm a bit more experienced,” Stolz said. “I've gotten stronger. My technique has gotten better. I feel like everything overall has improved, and it's shown in the times.”\n\nIndeed, speed skating hasn’t been the same since.\n\nJust how dominant has Stolz been since Beijing Olympics?\n\nNine months after the 2022 Olympics, Stolz became the youngest man to capture an individual World Cup race, winning both the 1,000- and 1,500-meter races. A month later, he made the podium in three races – the 500-, 1,000- and 1,500-meter – at the same World Cup for the first time.\n\nHe won the three sprint distances at the 2023 junior world championships, then did the same thing a month later at the senior worlds. It made him the youngest world champion, and first man to win three golds at a single world championships.\n\nStolz duplicated that feat the following year and then won the World Allround Speed Skating Championships, a prestigious event that tests skaters at the short, middle and long distances. At 19, he was the youngest skater to win it since Heiden, who was 17 when he won the first of three consecutive titles.\n\n“I remember watching Heiden,” Dirk Stolz said, a note of awe in his voice. “This kid is getting compared to one of the greatest Olympic athletes? How did this happen?”\n\nWhy these Olympics could be transformational\n\nThose kind of comparisons, and the expectations they bring, could send any athlete sideways. So, too, the glare of the spotlight. Stolz is featured heavily in NBC’s promotions for the Olympics – he’s alongside Hollywood heartthrob Glen Powell in one ad – and is showing up in commercials for big-name brands like Honda, Omega and Ralph Lauren.\n\nIf he does win multiple golds in the 2026 Winter Games, it could catapult him to a level of superstardom that transcends sports, that rarefied air that Michael Phelps and Simone Biles occupy.\n\nStolz is not daunted by this. He is extremely confident without being cocky, recognizing that hard work, not luck, is what got him here, and continued hard work is what will be required for continued success.\n\n“I just try and keep realistic,” Stolz said. “We know what we're doing that's working to make me faster. So I think if we continue to do that, it'll continue to progress.\n\n“I try not to get too far ahead of it or think like, 'Oh, I'm going to skate this time next year.’ I just kind of try and see where it ends up,” Stolz added. “I know if I get stronger in the summer, good chances are you're going to be faster in the winter.”\n\nIt helps that Stolz has gotten a taste of the limelight that awaits when he’s traveled to the Netherlands, where speed skating is a national obsession. It helps even more that, in addition to his family and Corby, his support group includes Davis, a two-time Olympic champion whose career was marked as much by missteps as medals.\n\nThe two remain close, with Davis describing Stolz as a little brother, and Davis does not hesitate to shoot Stolz straight in a way no one else can. He will never give Stolz better than a six out of 10 after a race, knowing it will encourage the younger skater to stay hungry. He counsels Stolz to be careful with what he says and does, knowing all too well that the court of public opinion does not give do-overs.\n\n“I didn't have an adviser that knew the information that I needed, and I was always kind of learning things the hardest way possible,” Davis said. “I wish I had had somebody like that, but it makes me want to advise and help just for that very reason alone.\n\n“Hindsight's 20-20, but if I could have done things a little bit better, maybe I would've had slightly better results,” said Davis, who won a gold and a silver at both the 2006 and 2010 Olympics.\n\n“I'm just happy to be in the position I'm in, to give back from what I've experienced and what I worked for,” Davis added. “I can see him picking up where I left off and even pushing the bar further.”\n\nThat is what’s most astounding. Or, if you’re Stolz’s competitors, most terrifying.\n\nAt 21, Stolz’s career is just beginning. Even if he’d win four golds in Italy, he can, and almost certainly will, get better.\n\n“You kind of get addicted to improving the times and trying to go faster,” Stolz said. “It's something you have to learn or grow into, but I really like it.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/01/31/remember-when-eric-heiden-wins-record-five-gold-medals-1980-winter-olympics/1050986001/", "title": "Remember when?

She attended Michigan Tech where she played three sports (cross-country skiing, cross country and track and field).\n\nJoanne Reid, 33, born in Madison\n\nReid calls Colorado home but has an impressive Wisconsin lineage, born in Madison and the daughter of Beth Heiden, a bronze medalist in speedskating at the 1980 Olympics and the sister of Eric Heiden, a five-time gold medalist at the same games. Reid will be appearing in her third Olympics, and her mother (a structural engineer) helped build her rifle.\n\nPaul Schommer, 33, Appleton\n\nAlso an Olympian in Beijing, the Kimberly High School alumnus Schommer took seventh in the 4x6k mixed relay. He attended The College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nCROSS COUNTRY SKIING\n\nKevin Bolger, 32, Minocqua\n\nAt the Beijing Olympics, he took ninth in the 4x10k relay and 17th in the men's sprint freestyle. He most recently took seventh in a relay at the 2025 world championships.\n\nWOMEN’S HOCKEY\n\nWisconsin is all over the women's hockey scene, with a whopping five current players suiting up in the Olympics (four for team USA) and a total of 12 current or former players competing for either USA, Canada or Czechia. The U.S. will be a gold-medal favorite one Olympics cycle after taking second to Canada. The arch-rivalry has ample UW presence on both sides.\n\nThe head coach of the women's team, John Wroblewski, is a native of Neenah. Current University of Wisconsin athletic trainer Stefanie Arndtand former UW director of operations/equipment manager Sis Paulsen are on the Team USA staff, as well.\n\nBritta Curl-Salemme, 25, University of Wisconsin\n\nShe played for UW from 2018-24, and the North Dakota native now plays in the Professional Women's Hockey League, where her Minnesota Frost team won the league title in 2025. She's competed in four World Championships for Team USA.\n\nLaila Edwards, 21, University of Wisconsin\n\nThe Ohio native has played on two World Championships teams and will become the first Black woman to play for the U.S. women's Olympic team after she already became the first Black woman to play for the U.S. women's senior national team. She's one of four current Badgers on Team USA.\n\nCaroline Harvey, 23, University of Wisconsin\n\nThe New Hamsphire native is perhaps the top player in the country, leading the nation in assists and sitting second in points. The defender could become the first overall pick in the upcoming Professional Women's Hockey League draft. This already is on her second Olympics; she played on the 2022 team before she even began her UW playing career.\n\nHilary Knight, 36, University of Wisconsin\n\nA legend in the sport, she'll be competing in her fifth Olympics, the most of any women's hockey player in U.S. history. She won two national titles at Wisconsin and remains the UW career scoring leader with 143 goals (second in points at 262). She's been a Team USA captain since 2023.\n\nAva McNaughton, 21, University of Wisconsin\n\nOne of three goaltenders on Team USA, she's the second-youngest player on the team. The Pennsylvania native ranks second in the NCAA with a 1.27 goals-against average.\n\nKirsten Simms, 21, University of Wisconsin\n\nShe's playing in her first Olympics after two stints on the World Championship teams. She's one of nine Badgers to clear 200 career points, including the game-tying and winning goals in the thrilling 2024 title-game win over Ohio State.\n\nEmily Clark, 30, University of Wisconsin (playing for Canada)\n\nNow a three-time Olympian with a gold and silver already to her name, Clark is back for one more round. She was part of the Badgers' 2019 championship team.\n\nBlayre Turnbull, 32, University of Wisconsin (playing for Canada)\n\nShe played for Wisconsin from 2011-15 and is bouncing back from a scary 2021 injury in which she broke her fibula celebrating the IIHF Women's World Championship victory. She received her gold medal with a smile on her face, on a stretcher. She had a goal and two assists in the semifinal win of the 2022 Olympics, a 10-3 win over Switzerland.\n\nDaryl Watts, 26, University of Wisconsin (playing for Canada)\n\nThe first-time Olympian transferred to Wisconsin in 2019 and set a program record for most assists in a season with 49, leading the NCAA with 74 points. She had the game-winning goal in overtime against Northeastern in the NCAA championship game in 2021.\n\nAnn-Renee Desbiens, 31, University of Wisconsin (playing for Canada)\n\nThe goalie won the Patty Kazmaier Award in 2017 and led the Badgers to four Frozen Fours, breaking the NCAA record for shutouts along the way. She won a silver medal in 2018 and gold in 2022, when she made 38 saves in the final game against USA.\n\nSarah Nurse, 31, University of Wisconsin (playing for Canada)\n\nShe played with the Badgers from 2013-17. In 2018, she scored what turned out to be the winning goal for Canada in her team's 2-1 win over the United States in pool play. Though the U.S. won that gold medal, she posted a tournament-leading 18 points at the 2022 Olympics as Canada defeated USA in the final, with Nurse notching a goal and assist.\n\nAdéla Šapovalivova, 19, University of Wisconsin (playing for Czechia)\n\nThe current Badgers freshman forward (and fifth current UW player to play in the Olympics) is the first European player to play for UW and the first Badger to appear in the Olympics for a team other than USA or Canada. Her team will face Team USA on Feb. 5 in Milan. She was named Best Forward at the 2024 U18 Women's World Championships.\n\nBOBSLED\n\nJadin O'Brien, 23, Pewaukee\n\nThe three-time NCAA champion in the pentathlon at Notre Dame and a former Divine Savior Holy Angels track and field standout made a pivot to winter sports, qualifying in the two-man bobsled competition.\n\nLUGE\n\nMarcus Mueller, 20, Brookfield\n\nMueller, a Brookfield Central alumnus, won the U23 world championship in men's doubles with teammate Ansel Haugsjaa in 2025 and is a three-time junior World Cup gold medalist in men's doubles, as well. The pair will team up in Cortina as well. As a 12-year-old, Mueller made a luge track in his basement.\n\nNORDIC COMBINED\n\nBen Loomis, 27, Eau Claire\n\nLoomis will head to the Olympics for a third time after competing in Pyeongchang in 2018 and Beijing in 2022. Last Olympics, he took sixth on the team large hill event, and he took 10th in that event four years earlier. The event features cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Loomis, who moved to Utah as a teenager but still learned ski jumping at Flying Eagles Ski Club in Eau Claire, was the USSA Nordic Combined Athlete of the Year in 2016 and joined the Army in 2019.\n\nSPEED SKATING\n\nJordan Stolz, 21, Kewaskum\n\nThe young speed-skating phenom has a chance to become the face of the Olympics for the United States, in any sport. With his specialties in the 500 meters, 1,000 meters and 1,500 meters, he has a real chance to win three golds. He has 10 medals overall in world championships races, including seven gold and two silver.\n\nEmery Lehman, 29, Marquette University\n\nHeading to his third Olympics, the Illinois native already has a bronze medal to his name after winning it in Beijing in 2022 with the men's team pursuit. He took gold in the same event in 2025 at the world championships. He played club hockey during his days at Marquette. In 2014, Lehman became the youngest male U.S. speed skater to make his Olympic debut, besting a record previously set by Wisconsin speed-skating legend Eric Heiden in 1976.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/01/30/favorite-winter-olympics-moments-miracle-on-ice-peggy-fleming/9050440002/", "title": "Winter Olympics: My top 10 favorite moments start with 'Miracle'", "text": "Updated Jan. 30, 2022, 10:31 a.m. ET\n\nI have been fortunate to cover the past nine Winter Olympic Games, every one since Calgary in 1988.

That the last two occurred halfway around the world, in time zones that were not friendly to U.S. audiences, made it even harder to keep them front of mind.\n\nYou will want to tune in for these Games, though.\n\nMuch like the 2024 Summer Games in Paris, Milano Cortina offers a respite from the malaise that lingers from the COVID pandemic and the divisiveness that continues to make our world feel cruel and small. For two-plus weeks, we can be united, reveling in amazing athletic performances, captivated by the personal stories of sweat sacrifice, and dazzled by the breathtaking beauty of the Dolomites and the Alps.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\n“To be able to have them back in the stands in Italy will be a perfect way to end a really blessed career,\" U.S. speedskater Brittany Bowe said.\n\nHere's your primer on the 10 biggest questions going into the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nHow spread out will these Olympics be?\n\nPut it this way: Getting around to all the venues could be an Olympic sport in itself.\n\nThe Winter Olympics always sprawl, because of the need for mountains. But the Milano Cortina Games are going to be the most geographically spread out in Olympic and Paralympic history, with a footprint just slightly smaller than the entire state of New Jersey.\n\nMost of the indoor events — hockey, speed skating, short-track speedskating and figure skating — are going to be in Milano. For the mountain events, however, organizers are making use of venues already used for World Cups and world championships. And they are not close to one another. Or close to Milano.\n\nThe trip from Milano to Cortina, where women’s Alpine, curling and the sliding sports (bobsled, luge and skeleton) will be held, is almost five hours. Livigno, site of snowboarding and freestyle skiing, is about three hours from Milano.\n\nIf you want to get to Livigno from Cortina? Pack supplies, water and something to keep yourself entertained, because it’s going to be a roughly six-hour trip. All this assumes, too, that there’s no traffic or weather delays. Given it’s the Olympics and it’s February, and the Paralympics and March, probably best not to count on that.\n\nIs the bobsled track ready?\n\nYes, though organizers cut it close.\n\nCortina’s original bobsled track, used in the 1956 Olympics, closed in 2008 because it was getting too expensive to maintain. Milano Cortina’s bid plan called for the track to be renovated, but the idea was abandoned because it was going to cost a boatload of money and there were existing tracks nearby in Switzerland and Austria that could be used.\n\nThen the Italian government raised a fuss, saying all Olympic events needed to be in Italy.\n\nWith the Games just two years away, construction on the new Eugenio Monti track began in February 2024. Though there were concerns the $136 million project wouldn’t get done in time — the IOC had Lake Placid on standby — the track was ready for test runs in the spring of 2025 and the IOC gave approval for its use.\n\n“The sliding centre in Cortina has surpassed expectations,\" Kristin Kloster, chair of the IOC’s coordination commission for Milano Cortina, said in September.\n\n“They have delivered on time. The sliding centre has been tested by athletes already and I think it's all going really, really well,” Kloster said. “So I'm impressed with the work.\"\n\nOfficial test events in November were held without fans, because construction was still being one around the sliding center. But the track drew praise from athletes.\n\n“I really love the track!” said U.S. push athlete Azaria Hill, who teamed with Kaysha Love to win silver at the test event.\n\nIs Lindsey Vonn really back?\n\nShe is, although she revealed on Feb. 3 that she suffered a torn ACL in a Jan. 30 downhill crash. She said she plans to still compete at these Games, the downhill race on Feb. 8 being her main goal.\n\n\"I'm still here. I think I'm still able to fight. I think I'm still able to try. And I will try as long as I have the ability to, I will not go home regretting not trying,\" Vonn said. \"I will do everything in my power to be in that starting gate.\"\n\nUp until the crash, it has been one of the most incredible comeback stories — ever. In any sport. Not only because Vonn is 41 and was retired for almost six years, but also because she’s skiing after having a partial knee replacement.\n\n“I have nothing to prove,” Vonn said last fall. “I’m doing it because I love it.”\n\nVonn is one of the greatest skiers in history, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010 and No. 3 on the list of career World Cup victories. But a series of injuries over the course of her career took their toll, and she retired in February 2019.\n\nFast-forward to spring of 2024, when Vonn had a partial knee replacement.\n\nReturning to ski racing wasn’t the goal. Vonn simply wanted to live a normal life and do the things she enjoyed — playing tennis, hiking, walking! — without debilitating pain. But as she recovered and found herself able to do things she hadn’t in years, Vonn wondered if ski racing was possible.\n\nShe resumed training and, in December 2024, skied in her first World Cup race in almost six years. Vonn had mixed results in her first season, but she finished by winning a silver medal in super-G at the World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\nWith a full offseason to train and fine-tune her equipment, Vonn has simply been a marvel. She won the season’s first downhill — that was World Cup victory No. 83, for those counting — and has been on the podium or near it in every other race.\n\n“All the people that didn’t believe in me, I have to thank them because it really gives me a lot of motivation,\" Vonn said after her win. \"I’m surprised that people haven’t figured that out by now. Every time you talk bad about me, it just makes me stronger and better and more motivated.\"\n\nCortina has always been one of her favorite courses: She made her first World Cup podium there, and 12 of her 83 wins came there.\n\nAthough she isn’t trying to prove anything to anyone, she is still Lindsey Vonn. She’s not interested in participation medals. She wants some real ones.\n\n“I know what I'm capable of, so I have my own expectations,” Vonn said. “I'm sure the world has their own as well, but I don't think yours will be higher than mine.”\n\nWhy should I follow Jordan Stolz?\n\nBecause he’s the Michael Phelps of his generation.\n\nStolz has dominated speed skating the last three years, sweeping the 500-, 1,000- and 1,500-meter titles at the world championships in 2023 and 2024 and winning the overall season champion at all three distances last season. He’s unbeaten in the 1,000 and 1,500 meters this World Cup season, and has won five of the nine 500-meter races.\n\nHe put the mass start back in his international program after a two-year absence, and was on the podium in two of the first four World Cups.\n\nThat means Stolz will be a gold-medal favorite in each of his individual events in Milano Cortina. Should he win all four races, it would be the most golds for a U.S. Winter Olympian since Eric Heiden famously swept all five speed skating events at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid.\n\nHeiden is the only Winter Olympian to win five golds at a single Games. Only two, Norwegian biathlon great Ole Einar Bjorndalen (2002) and Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova (1964), have won four.\n\n“There's a lot of confidence there. I had some really good (World Cup) races,” Stolz said after the Olympic trials. “Now that I'm actually planning a peak, I think it can get better. And even if it's the same, I think I still have really good chances at the Olympics.”\n\nWho else will be the stars in Milano Cortina?\n\nMikaela Shiffrin and Chloe Kim will always command the spotlight.\n\nShiffrin is a two-time Olympic champion who has more World Cup victories than any other skier, male or female. She’ll be a favorite in slalom, where she won the first five races of the season, and team combined, and a medal contender in giant slalom.\n\nKim has won gold in the halfpipe at the last two Olympics, and, if healthy after two shoulder dislocations in recent weeks, she could make it three in a row.\n\nAlso keep an eye on Jessie Diggins, a medal threat in cross-country skiing; “Quad God” Ilia Malinin, whose quadruple jumps make him almost unbeatable in figure skating; and Mystique Ro, a two-time medalist at last year’s skeleton world championships. Don’t sleep on Campbell Wright and Deedra Irwin, who have the best chance of winning the United States’ first Olympic medal ever in biathlon.\n\nLastly, U.S. captain Hilary Knight has already said these Olympics, her fifth, will be her last, and she and the U.S. women’s hockey team would like nothing better than to go out on top. Though the Americans have not won Olympic gold since 2014, they have had the upper hand on archrival Canada lately. They’ve won two of the last three world championships, including an overtime thriller last spring, and walloped Canada 24-7 in the four Rivalry Series games in the fall.\n\nSpeaking of hockey, what about the NHL players?\n\nFor the first time since 2014, NHL players will take part in the Winter Games. Every team but host Italy has at least one NHL player on its roster, and the U.S., Canada and Sweden squads are comprised entirely of NHL players.\n\n“We’ve got a really good group of young, hungry Americans that haven’t played in the Olympics before,” Jack Hughes said after the U.S. roster was announced. “We’re lucky the NHLers are back in the Olympics. Guys are pumped up.”\n\nAs are fans.\n\nSince they began competing at the Nagano Games in 1998, NHL players have made the men’s Olympic tournament better and more exciting. But the NHL (stupidly) refused to allow its players to compete in 2018 — much to the unhappiness of the players.\n\nThe league initially planned to return for the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, only for COVID to cause so many cancellations in the months leading up to the Games that the NHL said taking a three-week break would be at the expense of the regular season and playoffs.\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman has complained about the size and construction of the Milano Cortina rinks, but he recognizes the Olympics, and the league, both benefit from the NHL’s participation.\n\n“I think it's going to be great,\" Bettman said in October. “Listen, there are lots of reasons that I'm never thrilled about taking a couple of week break in the season. Changes a lot of things.\n\n\"But on balance, I think it'll be worth it, A) for the exposure, B) for the fan engagement, but C) and most importantly, this is and has always been very important to our players. And that's why we're doing this.\"\n\nWhat’s the status of the Russians?\n\nThis is not the start of a brain teaser, we promise.\n\nRussia remains banned by the International Olympic Committee, though there will be some Russian athletes at the Milano Cortina Games. Russia is no longer banned by the International Paralympic Committee, but no Russian athletes are expected at the Milano Cortina Games.\n\nGot that?\n\nThe IOC is maintaining the same position as it had for the Summer Games in Paris, allowing Russians and Belarussians to compete as “Individual Neutral Athletes,” or AIN in the French translation. Those athletes cannot wear their country’s colors or participate in the opening ceremony, and they will hear a generic anthem if they win a gold medal.\n\nAs of Jan. 27, 20 athletes in eight sports — Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, luge, short-track speedskating, speedskating and ski mountaineering — had been cleared to compete in Milano Cortina.\n\nThe IPC, on the other hand, lifted its ban of Russia and Belarus in September, clearing both countries to return to the Paralympics wearing their names and colors. But not all sport federations have lifted their bans, while others did not lift them in time for athletes to qualify for Milano Cortina. As a result, the IPC said In October that it didn’t expect any athletes from the two countries at the 2026 Paralympics.\n\nAny new events?\n\nBetween wanting to appeal to people in the host country and trying to attract the attention of the kids, of course there are new events.\n\nSome are relays or mixed-gender events or expansion of existing events. (Or, in the case of ski jumping, joining the 21st century). There is one new entirely new sport making its debut in 2026, however. Ski mountaineering. Or SkiMo.\n\nPopular in Italy with elite athletes and weekend warriors alike, ski mountaineering is an endurance sport where athletes climb a hill and then, once at the top, ski down it. Lightweight skis with “skins” help with the climbs, and there is a section on the ascent that has to be navigated on foot.\n\nThere will be individual sprint races for both the men and women, as well as a mixed relay.\n\nThe other new events are dual moguls, which involves head-to-head runs; women’s doubles in luge; and mixed-team in skeleton. There’s also the large hill in women’s ski jumping, which strikes a blow for equality. Women’s ski jumping has only been in the Olympics since 2014. The women were limited to the normal hill in Sochi, Pyeongchang and Beijing while the men did both the normal and large hills. Now both genders will compete on the same hills. As they should.\n\nHow are IOC’s efforts at gender parity going?\n\nThe International Olympic Committee says Milano Cortina will be the most gender-balanced Winter Games yet, with women making up 47% of the almost 3,000 athletes. That’s up from the nearly 45% in Beijing.\n\nCounting mixed-gender events, women will compete in 53.4% of the events in Milano Cortina, also a high for a Winter Games.\n\nBut there’s still work to be done. Remember how ski jumping added the large hill event for the women? It also added a super team event for men, so women still have one less event in ski jumping.\n\nWill the stars come out like they did in Paris?\n\nMariah Carey is performing at the opening ceremony, so that’s a pretty good start.\n\nParis was the place to be in 2024, with celebrities like Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman and Zendaya showing up at the Olympics. You could have played a game of “Where’s Waldo?” with all the different events Tom Cruise took in.\n\nAlthough we might not see quite as many A-listers, Milano is Italy’s fashion capital and Fashion Week starts two days after the closing ceremony. Don’t be surprised if celebrities come early to take in both events.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/03"}]}

Whether it was life in the so-called “closed loop” that separated Olympic athletes, journalists and workers from the rest of China, the below-zero temperatures and howling winds in the mountains or the daily anxiety of COVID-19 testing and possible isolation, it was a difficult journey for everyone who made it here.\n\nThen the competition began, and many of the hot-button issues surrounding the start of the Olympics – like human rights – faded to the background. New ones, like a major doping scandal in figure skating, arose. At the end, though, China pulled off a Winter Games without too many hiccups – though it was more successful for some than others.\n\nThe U.S. finished with 25 medals overall, the fifth-most behind Norway, Russia, Germany and Canada and an uptick from 2018 (23 medals) and nearly on par with 2014 (28 medals). Here’s a day-by-day look back at what happened in Beijing:\n\nFeb. 2: Competition for the 2022 Beijing Games officially got underway with the first session of mixed doubles curling.\n\nFeb. 3:The freestyle skiing events began with men’s and women’s moguls qualification runs, while ice hockey began with four women’s games. The Americans got off to a strong start with a 5-2 win over Finland, while Canada beat Switzerland 12-1.\n\nFeb. 4: The figure skating team event – which would play an unusually large role in the narrative of these Games – started in the morning, with men’s singles followed by rhythm dance and then the pairs short program. As usual on the first Friday of the Olympics, everything built toward the opening ceremony, which took place at the famed “Bird's Nest” National Stadium, which was built for the 2008 Summer Games. The most significant heads of state in attendance were Russian president Vladimir Putin, Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Polish president Andrzej Duda. During the parade of nations, cameras caught Putin sleeping – or perhaps pretending to be asleep – when Ukraine’s Olympic team made its entrance. China’s choice of Uyghur cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang as one of the two athletes to light the cauldron raised eyebrows, as China’s alleged human rights abuses, including the detention of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region, is a key reason why the U.S. and many other Western countries staged a diplomatic boycott of these Games.\n\nFeb 5: The first full day of competition got underway with the women’s snowboard slopestyle, where three Americans advanced to the finals. Dutch speedskater Irene Schouten set the Olympic record for the women’s 3,000-meter mass start, while China won its first gold medal of the Games in short track's mixed team relay. U.S. women’s hockey shut out Russia, 5-0.\n\nFeb. 6: Snowboarder Julia Marino secured the first Team USA medal of the Games, finishing second in slopestyle to Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, who won the first-ever Winter Olympics gold medal for New Zealand. American Jaelin Kauf, a two-time world champion, took silver in the women’s moguls. The team competition continued in figure skating, with 15-year old Russian Kamila Valieva scoring 90.18 in her short program, well ahead of the field.\n\nUSA MEDAL COUNT: Full list of every medal won by Team USA at Beijing Games\n\nWHO LEADS THE MEDAL COUNT? How each country performed at the Winter Games\n\nFeb. 7: The morning began with a big surprise when Mikaela Shiffrin, the top Alpine skier in the world in the tech events, crashed out of the giant slalom about 10 seconds into the event she won at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang. “I won’t ever get over this,” she said, and it turned into a harbinger of difficulties to come for the American star. Canadian Max Parrot, who underwent treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2019, won the men’s snowboard slopestyle while defending Olympic champion Red Gerard finished fourth. Ireen Wust, the 35-year old Dutch speedskater, became the first athlete to win golds at five different Olympics in the 1,500 meters. It was her sixth gold and 12th overall medal. The team figure skating event wrapped up with the Americans finishing second to the Russians, but Vincent Zhou was not able to celebrate with the team due to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\nFeb. 8: Despite out-shooting Canada 53-27, the U.S. women’s hockey team lost 4-2 in the preliminary round, though both teams knew there would likely be a rematch in the gold medal game. Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, who competes in both Alpine and snowboarding, won the snowboarding parallel giant slalom for the second consecutive Olympics. Jessie Diggins, the star of the American women’s cross-country team, took bronze in the women’s sprint freestyle while teammate Rosie Brennan was right behind in fourth. Eileen Gu, the American-born freestyle skiing star who chose to compete for her mother’s native China, landed the first double cork 1620 of her career on the final run to win gold in the big air final. Ryan Cochran-Siegle, whose mother Barbara Cochran won gold in slalom at the 1972 Olympics, won a shocking silver in the super-G. Nathan Chen put on one of the best performances of his career in the men’s figure skating short program to score 113.97. Meanwhile, word began to percolate that something was up with the team results when the medals were not given out.\n\nFeb 9: The issue with the team figure skating event was revealed to the world. Valieva, the gold medal favorite in the women’s competition, had tested positive for a banned substance. She continued to practice as Russia appealed the result. Meanwhile, Shiffrin posted another puzzling “DNF” – Did Not Finish – in the slalom, arguably her best event. The U.S. men’s curling team began its gold medal defense with a 6-5 win over Russia. Freestyle skier Colby Stevenson, who is known as a slopestyle specialist, snagged what he called a “miracle” silver medal in the big air with a double cork 1800 on his final jump. But the first American gold of the Games went to 36-year-old Lindsey Jacobellis, who won the women's snowboard cross – the same event she was going to win in 2006 before falling on the second-to-last jump while attempting a celebratory snowboard grab.\n\nFeb. 10: It was a banner day for the U.S. team led by Chen, who came to Beijing looking to make up for a disappointing performance four years ago. He more than delivered with five quads and a smashing free skate score of 218.63 to win gold while skating to Elton John’s “Rocketman.” Chloe Kim, who was a breakout star in 2018 by winning the halfpipe gold medal in snowboarding, took care of business again. Her first run, which included a pair of 1080 spins, was more than enough to win a second gold. Later that evening, Americans won the debut of the mixed team aerials event, marking just the third time in history the U.S. won three gold medals in a day at the Winter Olympics.\n\nFeb. 11: After revealing officially that this would be his fifth and final Olympics, three-time gold medalist Shaun White ended his career with a fourth-place finish in the halfpipe. The torch was passed to Japan’s Ayumu Hirano, who put down a pair of sensational runs. His gold-clincher included a triple cork 1440 and two double cork 1440s. Shiffrin finished a race for the first time at these Games, finishing ninth in the super-G. The U.S. women’s hockey team beat the Czech Republic 4-1 in the quarterfinals. Swedish speedskater Nils van der Poel, who already won gold in the 5,000, added another title in the 10,000 and smashed his own world record by more than two seconds.\n\nFeb. 12: At a second straight Winter Games without NHL players, the mostly unknown U.S. team of college players and European league veterans beat Canada, 4-2, on its way to a 3-0 finish in the group stage. American skeleton racer Katie Uhlaender, a veteran of five Olympics, finished sixth in her likely last career appearance. The U.S. mixed snowboard cross team of Jacobellis and 40-year-old Nick Baumgartner turned back the clock by winning gold.\n\nFeb. 13: Erin Jackson of Ocala, Florida, was favored to win the 500-meter speedskating race and she delivered, becoming the first Black woman to win an individual Olympic medal in the history of the sport. She was also the first American to win the 500 since Bonnie Blair in 1994.\n\nFeb. 14: Kaillie Humphries, a former Canadian bobsledder who only received her U.S. citizenship in December, won gold in the inaugural women’s monobob. American stalwart Elana Meyers Taylor, competing in her fourth Olympics, came back after a disappointing first two runs to win silver. It was especially sweet for Meyers Taylor, who spent the first part of the Olympics in isolation due to a positive COVID-19 test. The American pair of Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue took bronze in ice dance. But the biggest news of the day was the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling that Valieva could compete in the women’s figure skating competition despite the positive test.\n\nFeb. 15: With the eyes of the world on figure skating, Valieva led the short program with 82.16, though she did stumble on a triple axel and looked emotionally drained at the end of her performance. Shiffrin’s difficult Olympics continued in the women’s downhill, where she finished 18th. Italy’s Sofia Goggia, the defending champion, won a remarkable silver medal just three weeks after a major crash in Cortina that left her with a partially torn ligament in her left knee and small fracture in her fibula. Gu took a silver medal in the slopestyle freeski, while 17-year old former child actor Su Yiming gave China the gold medal in the men’s snowboard big air.\n\nFeb. 16: Alex Hall, who has been the top American freeskier for the last couple years, took a creative approach to the slopestyle course and won gold while Nick Goepper won silver – his third consecutive Games medaling in this event. Americans have won six of the nine slopestyle medals since it was added to the Olympics. The U.S. men’s hockey team was eliminated in the quarterfinals, losing to Slovakia 3-2 in a penalty shootout after giving up the tying goal with less than a minute left in regulation.\n\nFeb. 17:Valieva’s shaky long program with multiple stumbles ultimately took her off the podium, behind Russian teammates Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. But the emotional scenes afterwards sparked global debate about whether she was ultimately the victim in this sad story. Alysa Liu was the top American in seventh place. Canada won the gold medal in women’s hockey, surviving a third-period flurry by the Americans to hold on 3-2 and avenge its defeat in the 2018 finals. Shiffrin, meanwhile, skied out once again, this time in the slalom portion of the Alpine combined. The U.S. men’s curling team needed to beat Denmark in the morning to qualify for the medal round and got it done, 7-5, but lost the semifinals to Great Britain later in the evening. Speedskater Brittany Bowe, the world record holder in the 1,000 meters, won her first Olympic medal with a bronze in the event.\n\nFeb. 18: The U.S. men lost the curling bronze medal match to Canada, 8-5, but skipper John Shuster vowed to try for a sixth Olympic appearance in 2026. Johannes Thingnes Boe won his fourth gold medal in six biathlon events at these Games in the 15K mass start, leading a Norwegian effort that topped the table with 37 total medals and 16 golds. Boe has five golds, two silvers and a bronze from the last two Olympics. Gu completed her first Olympics with a second gold medal, this one in the freeski halfpipe.\n\nFeb. 19: Meyers Taylor, in what may be the last race of her bobsled career, piloted the Americans to a bronze medal in the two-woman race. Though she never won gold, she comes home with her fifth medal in four Olympics. Sweden finally took gold in men’s curling, beating Great Britain four years after a crushing upset loss to the Americans in the final. Americans David Wise and Alex Ferreira took silver and bronze, respectively, in the freeski halfpipe behind New Zealand’s Nico Porteous.\n\nFeb. 20: Diggins ended her very good Olympics on a high note, taking silver in the women’s 30K race behind Norway’s Therese Johaug, who won three cross-country golds at these Games. Diggins was the only woman to finish in the top eight of all six cross-country races she could enter. Shiffrin’s last chance at a medal went by the wayside in the mixed team parallel final, which was delayed by a day due to high winds. The U.S. finished fourth in the event. The Germans completed a dominant performance in sliding, winning gold and silver in the four-man bobsled. Overall, the German team won seven medals in bobsled, six in luge and three in skeleton. Finland beat Russia, 2-1, to win its first-ever gold medal in men's hockey to finish the competition leading into the closing ceremony.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/sport/norway-beijing-2022-medal-table-spt-intl", "title": "Norway tops Beijing 2022 medal table after record-breaking ... - CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s official. Norway is really good at the Winter Olympics.\n\nWith a population of just over five million people, the European country has continued to punch above its weight at Beijing 2022, finishing way above the rest in the medal table.\n\nNorway tallied the most gold medals, 16, and the highest total number of medals, 37, of all the delegations competing this month.\n\n“Norway finished at the top of the Beijing Winter Olympics medal table, just as the Norway team did four years ago at Pyeongchang 2018,” said Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at data provider Nielsen Gracenote.\n\n“The Norwegian team won two fewer medals than their Olympic record total of 39 achieved in 2018 but broke the Olympic gold medal record by winning 16. Norway won medals in nine of the 15 sports at Beijing 2022.”\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claimed the second highest tally of medals, 32, with Germany winning the second highest tally of golds, 12.\n\nHowever, there is still a question mark over the medals in the figure skating team event, which could impact the ROC’s haul of six golds.\n\nThe medal ceremony was postponed and the results could change depending on the outcome of an investigation into the failed drug test of 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva.\n\nNorway’s gold medal haul represents the most ever won at a single Winter Games and cements the country’s dominance in winter sports.\n\nCNN’s Harry Enten put such success down to two major factors: weather and money.\n\nNorway ranks in the bottom five in World Bank data for average temperature during the year at about 36 degrees Fahrenheit (two degrees Celsius) and has money to cater for the often expensive resources needed to compete.\n\nIf winning is important, Norway’s chef de mission Tore Oevreboe says its not always the main focus.\n\n“The main objective for us is to make the athletes have fun all the way through the Games,” he said earlier in the Games.\n\n“We are very occupied with creating a good environment, a stable environment, a safe environment, an environment full of fun, so they can really enjoy life when they are doing sport at a high level.”\n\nNorway has dominated the medal table at Beijing 2022. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nThe majority of Norway’s gold medals, 11, came in biathlon and cross-country skiing events but it also saw success in sports such as speed skating and freestyle skiing.\n\nThere is hope that such success can inspire a new generation of Norwegians to try as many winter sports as possible.\n\n“Many of the kids have good opportunities to realize their potential in a variety of fields, and sport is one of them,” Oevreboe added.\n\nTop five nations at Beijing 2022 Norway: 16 gold, eight silver and 13 bronze, for a total of 37 . Germany: 12 gold, 10 silver and five bronze, for a total of 27. China: nine gold, four silver and two bronze, for a total of 15. US: eight gold, 10 silver and seven bronze, for a total of 25. Sweden: eight gold, five silver and five bronze, for a total of 18.\n\n“And then they will develop their potential as humans and citizens.”\n\nMeanwhile, Team China claimed nine golds and a total of 15 medals, delivering its best ever result at a Winter Olympics – and ranking above the United States.\n\nThe stellar performances of its new Olympic stars – from freeski sensation Eileen Gu to snowboard prodigy Su Yiming – captivated fans in the stands and across the country, drawing an outpouring of pride\n\nTeam USA managed eight golds, 10 silver and seven bronze, for a total of 25 medals at the Games.\n\nBoth New Zealand and Australia as well as Belgium had a Winter Games to remember.\n\n“New Zealand and Australia both had a record-breaking Winter Olympics, winning three and four medals respectively,” said Gleave.\n\n“New Zealand’s two gold medals were the country’s first at a Winter Olympics. Australia’s four medals were one more than the previous record of three, achieved at each of the last three Winter Games.”\n\n“Belgium equaled its record of two Winter Olympic medals which was previously achieved at St. Moritz 1948,” added Gleave. “The gold medal won by Bart Swings was Belgium’s second ever and first since Micheline Lannoy and Pierre Baugniet were first in the pairs figure skating 74 years ago.”\n\nThe full medal table can be found here.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/05/10/which-country-has-most-olympic-medals/11414925002/", "title": "Olympic medals by country: These nations are the top winners", "text": "May 10, 2023 Updated July 19, 2024, 1:12 p.m. ET\n\nIt's almost time for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games to start, and the sports world is abuzz with predictions for who from Team USA will take home the gold. Nearly 600 athletes will represent the U.S. across 31 different sports, including fan favorites like gymnast Simone Biles, swimmer Katie Ledecky and sprinter Noah Lyles. There are plenty of first-timers to watch – including three 16-year-olds – as well as three six-time Olympians.\n\nBefore we find out who will take home one of the Eiffel Tower-encrusted medals, here are the current global standings.\n\nWhich country has the most Olympic medals?\n\nThe United States has won the most Olympic medals of any country, claiming 3,105 as of the 2022 Beijing Olympics. This includes 1,229 gold medals, 1,000 silver and 876 bronze, according to Olympedia, a database created by members of the International Society of Olympic Historians.\n\nAfter that is Germany with 1,211 total medals. Germany took the second place spot from the Soviet Union last year when they won 142 medals in the winter games. The Soviet Union now is now third with a close 1,204 medals. The Soviet Union disbanded in 1991 and its former republics now compete as independent countries.\n\nHere are the top 10 countries with the most Olympic medals as of 2023:\n\nUnited States: 3,105 Germany: 1,211 Soviet Union: 1,204 France: 1,039 Great Britain: 1,036 People's Republic of China: 899 Italy: 885 Russian Federation: 779 Sweden: 740 Japan: 690\n\nDespite the U.S. leading in all-time medals, several countries outranked them in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics medal count. Norway earned the most overall medals with 16 gold, eight silver and 13 bronze – 37 in total. Russia was banned from the 2022 Olympics because of involvement in a doping scandal, but Russian athletes were allowed to compete under the organization Russian Olympic Committee rather than for their country. ROC athletes won 32 medals in the latest games. Germany took home 27 and Canada 26. The U.S. won 25 medals last year – eight gold, 10 silver and seven bronze.\n\nWhen do the Olympics start?: 2024 Paris Summer Games schedule\n\nWhich country has the most gold medals?\n\nThe U.S. has the most gold medals – 1,229 and counting. The Soviet Union is second with 473 gold medals, followed by Germany and China with 384, Olympedia reports.\n\nThe U.S. has also won the most silver medals of any country by a large margin. The U.S. has 1,000 silver medals and the next highest is Germany with 419.\n\nWhy does the U.S. win so many Olympic medals?\n\nThere are plenty of countries whose medal counts don’t reach double digits, much less thousands. And there are many who have never won a medal in the history of the Games.\n\nThe U.S. is the third most populous country in the world behind China and India. As of March 2023, India’s population was nearly 1.4 billion, while the U.S. is a much smaller 335 million. So why does India have 58 medals compared to the 3,105 won by U.S. athletes?\n\nIt could have to do with an “effectively participating population,” one journal article argues, or the unequal political, economic and athletic opportunities from country to country. The study argues life expectancy and overall health, literacy, education, exposure to public information and interconnected cities can indicate a country’s ability to produce and send successful athletes to the Olympics.\n\nWhen are the next Olympic Games?\n\nThe next Olympic Games are the summer games in 2024, which involve sports like volleyball, water polo, cycling, golf, diving, rhythmic gymnastics, skating and sailing. The 2024 games will be held in Paris, France from July 26 to August 11.\n\nJust Curious for more? We've got you covered.\n\nUSA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day.

Gregory Bull/AP\n\nThe 18-year-old freeski superstar won three medals at her first Winter Olympics, including two golds. And in her last program, after a near-perfect performance on the women’s halfpipe, she even took a well-deserved victory lap.\n\nBorn in the US but competing for China, a decision that has been under its fair share of scrutiny, Gu had one of the splashiest Olympics debuts this year. And she made some history while she was at it – she’s the first freestyle skier to earn three medals at a single Games.\n\n“It has been two straight weeks of the most intense highs and lows I’ve ever experienced in my life,” she told reporters after her win. “It has changed my life forever.”\n\nNorway keeps winning and breaks a record\n\nNorway's Therese Johaug celebrates winning gold in the 30km cross-country skiing on Saturday.

She said in a video shared Friday that, as much as the comments hurt, she hopes that fans who’ve been in a similar situation can learn to tune out their “haters.”\n\n“That message was meant for you guys, to get up and to keep going,” she said in a video shared to Twitter. “Get out of bed the next day even though you’re getting these messages that make you feel awful.”\n\nIn her final event at Beijing 2022 the 26-year-old Shiffrin – along with River Radamus, Tommy Ford and Paula Moltzan – finished fourth in the mixed team parallel event at the National Alpine Skiing Centre.\n\n“I have had a lot of disappointing moments at these Games, today is not one of them,” said Shiffrin. “Today is my favorite memory.\n\n“This was the best possible way that I could imagine ending the Games, skiing with such strong teammates.”\n\nChloe Kim goes for the gold (again)\n\nChloe Kim enjoyed another golden Olympics.

She told reporters she’d had “the worst practice ever” before her gold-medal performance, failing to stick most of her landings.\n\nThat rough practice didn’t show on the snow – she attempted a trick that involved three-and-a-half spins in the air and earned a score of 94, propelling her to the gold once again.\n\nZhu Yi faces an online firestorm for her performance\n\nZhu of China was criticized for falling in her routine.

(That still leaves five \"true\" Michiganders suiting up for the U.S., don't worry.)\n\nHere's a look at the 28 Michigan-affiliated athletes looking for Olympic glory in the Milano-Cortina Games.\n\nEvan Bates, ice dance\n\nKey dates: Team rhythm dance, Feb. 6; team free dance, Feb.7; individual rhythm dance, Feb. 9; individual free dance, Feb. 11.\n\nThe buzz: Along with his skating partner (and wife) Madison Chock, Ann Arbor ice dancer Evan Bates will compete for the U.S. as one of Michigan's most decorated Olympians.\n\nChock and Bates were gold medalists in the team event and finished fourth in the individual event at the 2022 Games in Beijing, their only Olympic appearance. They've since won three gold medals in the world championships (2023-25) and, in all, a record seven U.S. national championships (2015, 2020, 2022-26). Bates also attended the University of Michigan and graduated in 2013.\n\nNick Baumgartner, snowboarding\n\nKey dates: Men's snowboard cross, Feb. 12; mixed team snowboard cross, Feb. 15.\n\nThe buzz:Nick Baumgartner of Iron River is a veteran on the snowboarding scene, first competing in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver before finally winning a gold medal in the mixed snowboard cross event with Lindsey Jacobellis at Beijing in 2022, his fourth Olympiad.\n\nAt 44 years old, Baumgartner is, by far, the oldest snowboarder on Team USA and the only Michigan-born Olympian to hail from the Upper Peninsula.\n\nLouis Boudon, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – France vs. Switzerland, Feb. 12; France vs. Czechia, Feb. 13; France vs. Canada, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: A native of France – which qualified in hockey for the first time since the 2002 Salt Lake City Games – Boudon spent four seasons (2019-23) at Lake Superior State in Sault Ste. Marie, racking up 39 goals a =nd 75 assists in 139 games with the Lakers. After two seasons in the minors in the U.S., Boudon returned to Europe to play for two seasons in Sweden and Finland.\n\nThis season, Boudon returned to the U.S., to play for the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL, where he picked up 12 goals and 18 assists in 25 games. But he went back to Europe in late December, signing with Jukurit Mikkeli in Finland's top league; he has a goal and two assists there.\n\nChristina Carreira, ice dance\n\nKey dates: Team rhythm dance, Feb. 6; team free dance, Feb.7; individual rhythm dance, Feb. 9; individual free dance, Feb. 11.\n\nThe buzz: Carreira was born in Montreal but moved to Novi when she was in middle school, and now calls St. Clair home.\n\nShe and her skating partner, Anthony Ponomarenko, earned bronze at the 2026 U.S. Championships, sending them to their first Olympics. Carreira got her U.S. citizenship in Detroit in 2025, making her eligible to compete in the Olympics.\n\nMadison Chock, ice dance\n\nKey dates: Team rhythm dance, Feb. 6; team free dance, Feb.7; individual rhythm dance, Feb. 9; individual free dance, Feb. 11.\n\nThe buzz: As previously mentioned, Chock and her husband Bates have made their second Olympic Games after taking gold in Beijing last time around in the team event. And while Chock was born in Redondo Beach, California, she went to Novi High School; the duo originally trained in Novi before moving to Montreal (though they'll still be competing for the U.S.).\n\nKyle Connor, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Latvia, Feb. 12; U.S. vs. Denmark, Feb. 14; U.S. vs. Germany, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Forward Kyle Connor is a 10-year NHL veteran, having spent his entire career with the Winnipeg Jets. But before he carved out his career in the Great White North, Connor began his hockey career in Michigan, growing up in Shelby Township and playing at Michigan.\n\nThe two-time NHL All-Star has represented the United States most prominently as a junior competitor, but never on the senior team, as this will mark his first-ever Olympic appearance.\n\nDustin Gazley, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Italy vs. Sweden, Feb. 11; Italy vs. Slovakia, Feb. 13; Italy vs. Finland, Feb. 14; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: The Novi native and former Michigan State forward will be one of the more senior hockey players in the tournament at age 37 as he suits up for the hosts, Italy. Gazley spent four seasons in East Lansing, racking up 30 goals and 43 assists in 153 games for the Spartans from 2007-11.\n\nAfter eight seasons in the AHL, Gazley jumped to Europe, where he has spent the past six seasons with Italian club Bolzano HC in the ICE Hockey League of Austria. With Bolzano, Gazley has 84 goals and 122 assists in 250 games.\n\nConnor Hellebuyck, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Latvia, Feb. 12; U.S. vs. Denmark, Feb. 14; U.S. vs. Germany, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Not to be outdone by his teammate (and fellow Connor), goalie Connor Hellebuyck has been in Winnipeg for 11 seasons. And though he was born and raised in Commerce Township, Hellebuyck played his college hockey at UMass before his NHL career started.\n\nHellebuyck is one of the NHL's most decorated goalies, having won the Vezina Trophy three times and finishing in the top five in voting on three other occasions (while adding a Hart Trophy as league MVP last season). He has represented the senior team on three occasions, but this will be his first year on the Olympic roster.\n\nJack Hughes, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Latvia, Feb. 12; U.S. vs. Denmark, Feb. 14; U.S. vs. Germany, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Center Jack Hughes was born in Orlando, Florida, and grew up in Toronto before settling in Canton for high school while playing for the U.S. National Team Development Program in Plymouth Hughes was drafted No. 1 overall by the New Jersey Devils in 2019 and earned All-Star Game nods in 2022 and 2023. He and older brother Quinn both made the Olympic roster, though younger brother Luke, also with the Devils, didn't make the cut.\n\nQuinn Hughes, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Latvia, Feb. 12; U.S. vs. Denmark, Feb. 14; U.S. vs. Germany, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Hughes, best known as a Norris Trophy winner with the Vancouver Canucks, was recently traded to the Minnesota Wild in one of the biggest NHL transactions of the 2025-26 season.\n\nQuinn's Michigan bona fides run a little deeper than his brothers', as he played at U-M from 2017-19 before heading to the NHL. Hughes earned All-Star Game nods in 2020 and 2024. Like his brother, he has represented Team USA before, but never in the Olympics.\n\nDeedra Irwin, biathlon\n\nKey dates: 15K individual, Feb. 11; 7.5K sprint, Feb. 14; 10K pursuit, Feb. 15; 6K relay, Feb. 18; 12.5K mass start, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Irwin, a Wisconsin native and alumnus of Michigan Tech in Houghton, was a two-time NCAA qualifier in cross-country skiing at MTU and made the U.S. biathlon team in 2020. (She also competed in cross country and track and field at MTU). A member of the Vermont Army National Guard (and 2021 Vermont Soldier of the Year), Irwin had one of the better stories at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nNot only did she finish seventh in women's individual biathlon (combining Nordic skiing and rifle shooting) – the best-ever finish by an American in the one winter sport the U.S. has never medaled in – but she met U.S. snowboarder Robby Burns; the two got engaged last year. “I'm not going to tell everybody to go to the Opening Ceremony and find the love of their life,” Irwin told reporters in January. “But it is possible. It happened to me.”\n\nJasmine Jones, bobsled\n\nKey dates: 2-woman bobsled Heats 1 & 2, Feb. 20; Heats 3 & 4, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Jones is a latecomer to bobsled; she starred in sprinting at Eastern Michigan, a stint that included setting the second-fastest 200-meter time in program history. Jones will be the first Winter Olympian in EMU history. Switching over to bobsled in 2018, she moved up through the U.S. two-person sled ranks as a pusher when paired with veteran pilot Kallie Armbruster Humphries. The duo won gold in World Cup competition on Jan. 11.\n\nLukas Kälble, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Germany vs. Denmark, Feb. 12; Germany vs. Latvia, Feb. 14; Germany vs. U.S., Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: A native of Germany, Lukas Kälble played four seasons (2017-21) on defense for Lake Superior State in Sault Ste. Marie, picking up seven goals and and 50 assists with a plus-12 rating in 131 games with the Lakers. After finishing his college career at Clarkson in New York, Kälble spent two seasons in the ECHL before returning to Germany's top league, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga for three seasons. That includes this one, in which the 28-year-old has three goals and 12 assists in 41 games for the Mannheim Eagles.\n\nThis will be Kälble's first Olympics, but he was a member of Germany's squads at Worlds in 2024 and 2025; he had two goals and two assists with a plus-2 rating in six games at the 2025 Worlds.\n\nMegan Keller, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Czechia, Feb. 5; U.S. vs. Finland, Feb. 7; U.S. vs. Switzerland, Feb. 9; U.S. vs. Canada, Feb. 10; Knockout round –quarterfinals, Feb. 13-14; semifinals, Feb. 16; gold-medal game, Feb. 19.\n\nThe buzz:Megan Keller of Farmington is one of the most decorated college hockey players of all time and one of the first stars of the PWHL, as she currently plays for the Boston Fleet. She also participated in the 2018 and 2022 Olympics for Team USA, earning gold in her first go-round and silver in her second.\n\nZak Ketterson, cross-country skiing\n\nKey dates: Men's 10km + 10km Skiathlon, Feb. 8; 10km Interval Start Classic, Feb. 13; 4x7.5km relay, Feb. 15.\n\nThe buzz: A Michigander by birth but raised in Minnesota, Zak Ketterson was a three-time All-American cross-country skier over his four seasons (2017-21) at Northern Michigan University in Marquette. His best finish while in college was a fourth-place spot in 20-kilometer freestyle event in the 2021 Worlds. As a pro in 2022, Ketterson skied the second leg for the first American relay team to finish on the podium in a World Cup event, winning gold.\n\nAt the 2025 Worlds, his 7.5-kilometer relay team finished seventh, while he personally finished 27th in the men's 10-kilometer Interval Start Classic and 41st in the 10=10-kilometer Skiathlon.\n\nVadym Kolesnik, ice dance\n\nKey dates: Team rhythm dance, Feb. 6; team free dance, Feb.7; individual rhythm dance, Feb. 9; individual free dance, Feb. 11.\n\nThe buzz: Ice dancer Vadym Kolesnik was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, but moved to the Detroit area when he was 15 years old. He received his U.S. citizenship in Troy in August. He and his skating partner, Emilea Zingas (more on her later), currently train in Novi and will be participating in their first Olympic Games.\n\nKaila Kuhn, freestyle skiing\n\nKey dates: Aerials qualifying, Feb. 19; aerials finals, Feb. 18.\n\nThe buzz: Boyne City native Kaila Kuhn first competed in the Olympics in Beijing in 2022, finishing in eighth place in the aerials event. She won two gold medals at the 2025 World Championships – doing so at age 21, the youngest American title-winner ever –and earned her first World Cup title on Jan. 12 in Lake Placid, weeks before her second Olympic Games.\n\nThe former gymnast (and big pancake fan) ripped off an impressive triple – that's three full flips with 360-degree spins – for her World Cup win as a preview of her Olympic routine, which, she says, only 8-10 female skiers can pull off: \"It's dangerous,\" she told reporters this month. \"It's scary. And there's a reason why not many of us do it.\"\n\nDylan Larkin, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Latvia, Feb. 12; U.S. vs. Denmark, Feb. 14; U.S. vs. Germany, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: There's no award for \"most Michigan\" Olympic athlete. But if there was, Red Wings center Larkin would have a strong case.\n\nNot only is Larkin the team captain for the Wings, but he was also born in Waterford Township and played a season at U-M. He has also played for Team USA dating back to junior events in 2013 and figures to be a key piece in his first-ever Olympics.\n\nAlex Petan, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Italy vs. Sweden, Feb. 11; Italy vs. Slovakia, Feb. 13; Italy vs. Finland, Feb. 14; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Canadian by birth, Alex Petan played four seasons at Michigan Tech (2012-16), with 59 goals and 76 assists in 153 games. His stint as a Husky included a 2015-16 season in which he captained the Tech squad and had 18 goas and 15 assists while winning WCHA Player of the Year honors and finishing as a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award (the Heisman Trophy of college hockey).\n\nAfter two seasons in the ECHL in the U.S., Petan went to Europe, where he has spent the past six seasons in the ICE Hockey League in Austria; this season, the 33-year old has seven goals and 23 assists in 41 games for Ljubljana Olimpija HK in Slovenia. Petan has played in multiple international tournaments for Italy, the host country/team making its first Olympic appearance since hosting the Games in Torino in 2006.\n\nLucas Raymond, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Sweden vs. Italy, Feb. 11; Sweden vs. Finland, Feb. 13; Sweden vs. Slovakia, Feb. 14; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: And now we come to our first Red Wing playing for a different country. The Wings' first-round pick in 2020 entered February with 116 career NHL goals and 196 assists, a total boosted by this season's team-high 40 helpers.\n\nRaymond has played for the Red Wings since the 2021-22 season and has represented Sweden on the national level since winning gold at the U18 World Championships in 2019. Since then, he has helped Sweden win two bronze medals, at the 2024 and 2025 World Championships.\n\nMortiz Seider, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Germany vs. Denmark, Feb. 12; Germany vs. Latvia, Feb. 14; Germany vs. U.S., Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Much like Lucas Raymond, Detroit Red Wings defenseman Moritz Seider is a Michigander by employment, as he will represent Germany in the Olympics.\n\nNot known as a traditional hockey power, Germany won silver at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics. And though Seider has represented Germany going back to 2017 (including Worlds appearances in 2019 and from 2021-25), this will be his first time playing for Germany's Olympic squad, which also features stars Leon Draisaitl and Tim Stützle.\n\nKirsten Simms, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Czechia, Feb. 5; U.S. vs. Finland, Feb. 7; U.S. vs. Switzerland, Feb. 9; U.S. vs. Canada, Feb. 10; Knockout round –quarterfinals, Feb. 13-14; semifinals, Feb. 16; gold-medal game, Feb. 19.\n\nThe buzz: Kirsten Simms of Plymouth is still in college, but the two-time NCAA champion is already a key player on Team USA's roster having competed on two World Cup teams and winning the gold medal over Canada at the 2025 World Cup.\n\nSimms led the country in scoring with 71 points in 36 games for the Wisconsin Badgers in the 2023-24 season and scored the NCAA championship-winning goal for Wisconsin over Ohio State in the 2025 NCAA tournament.\n\nWojciech Stachowiak, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Germany vs. Denmark, Feb. 12; Germany vs. Latvia, Feb. 14; Germany vs. U.S., Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: This Poland native spent two seasons (2018-20) at Michigan State, recording four goals and an assist in 40 games with the Spartans in a career halted by the coronavirus pandemic. He returned to Europe in 2020 to play with Ingolstadt ERC in the DEL in Germany; Stachowiak picked up 42 goals and 62 assists in 239 games.\n\nNow 26, Stachowiak came back to the U.S. this season, signing with the Tampa Bay Lightning before getting sent down to the Syracuse Crunch (the Bolts' AHL affiliate); in 36 games, he had nine goals and eight assists entering Saturday, Jan. 31. This will be his first Olympics, though he has experience on the world stage, as his three goals led Team Germany at the 2025 Worlds.\n\nFrederik Tiffels, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – Germany vs. Denmark, Feb. 12; Germany vs. Latvia, Feb. 14; Germany vs. U.S., Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: A German native, Frederik Tiffels played three seasons (2014-17) at Western Michigan, amassing 27 goals and 32 assists in 105 games. After splitting a season between the ECHL ad AHL in the U.S., Tiffels went back to Europe, where he has spent the past eight seasons playing in the DEL, the top league in Germany. That includes eight goals and 35 assists in 44 games with the Berlin Polar Bears.\n\nThis will be his second Olympics – he represented Germany at the Beijing Games last time around – but Tiffels owns one of the most iconic moments in Germany hockey history, scoring the OT winner in the semifinals of the 2023 Worlds to bounce the U.S. and give the Germans their first finals appearance in the current format, dating back to 1992.\n\nJake Vedder, snowboarding\n\nKey dates: Men's snowboard cross, Feb. 12; mixed team snowboard cross, Feb. 15.\n\nThe buzz: Pinckney's Jake Vedder has represented Team USA in snowboarding since the 2016 Youth Olympics, in which he brought home gold in the snowboard cross event. He entered the 2022 Beijing Olympics as an alternate but ended up competing, finishing sixth in snowboard cross while replacing injured Alex Deibold.\n\nWinter Vinecki, skiing\n\nKey dates: Aerials qualifying, Feb. 19; aerials finals, Feb. 18.\n\nThe buzz: Winter Vinecki of Gaylord may be the most impressive (and certainly the most appropriately named) Michigan-born athlete heading to the Winter Olympics, as she is also an accomplished marathon runner and triathlete in addition to freestyle skiing.\n\nVinecki competed in the 2022 Beijing Olympics and is teammates with fellow Michigander Kaila Kuhn.\n\nZach Werenski, hockey\n\nKey dates: Group play – U.S. vs. Latvia, Feb. 12; U.S. vs. Denmark, Feb. 14; U.S. vs. Germany, Feb. 15; Knockout round – play-off, Feb. 17; quarterfinals, Feb. 18; semifinals, Feb. 20; gold-medal game, Feb. 21.\n\nThe buzz: Grosse Pointe's Zach Werenski came oh-so-close to completing the Michigan hockey trifecta –native, college, pro – but has played his NHL career entirely for the Columbus Blue Jackets, about 3½ hours south of Detroit's Little Caesars Arena.\n\nWerenski has competed with the United States dating back to his U17 days, and this will be his first Olympic Games with Team USA.\n\nEmilea Zingas, ice dance\n\nKey dates: Team rhythm dance, Feb. 6; team free dance, Feb.7; individual rhythm dance, Feb. 9; individual free dance, Feb. 11.\n\nThe buzz: Emilea Zingas has represented Cyprus in international competitions but was born in Grosse Pointe Farms and has represented the United States since 2022.\n\nShe was named to her first Olympic team on Jan. 11 with her partner Vadym Kolesnik, who was born in Ukraine but currently lives in Novi where he trains with Zingas.\n\nNeed to catch up on the news during your lunch break?

The U.S. delegation in Beijing will feature several reigning Olympic medalists, recent world champions and up-and-coming starlets.\n\nHere are 23 key names to know ahead of the 2022 Games, including some who have already become winter sports stars and others who are poised to join them in the coming weeks. The opening ceremony will be held Feb. 4.\n\nNICE THREADS: 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony uniform unveiled\n\nJamie Anderson, women's snowboarding\n\nAnderson isn't short on accolades. She's the most decorated slopestyle snowboarder in X Games history, the first woman to land a 1080 off a jump and the only person to win an Olympic gold medal in the brief history of women's slopestyle. She's earned each of the past two.\n\nNow, the 31-year-old will be returning to the Winter Games for a third time, with her eyes on a three-peat and a fourth overall medal. (Anderson also won silver in big air at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.)\n\nKevin Bickner, men's ski jumping\n\nIt's been almost a century since the U.S. won its only Olympic medal in ski jumping, and that drought is likely to continue in Beijing.\n\nThat said, if there's one American to watch in the event, it's probably Kevin Bickner. The 25-year-old holds the national distance record of 802 feet, set in 2017. And he is coming off an 18th-place finish at the 2018 Games – which, while still a ways off the podium, marked the best finish for a U.S. man in the event since the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nTEXT WITH US:We'll share news and a behind-the-scenes look at the Beijing Olympics\n\nNEWSLETTER: Subscribe for free to get daily Olympics news in your email inbox\n\nSummer Britcher, women's luge\n\nAt 27, Britcher is already gearing up for what will be her third Olympic appearance. Though she didn't place higher than 15th individually in her first two trips, the Pennsylvania native has shown steady improvement over her career and seen better results of late, including a third-place finish in the 2018-19 World Cup standings.\n\nBritcher has also been an important member of the relay team in recent years, helping the U.S. to a fourth-place finish in Pyeongchang and a bronze medal at the 2020 world championships.\n\nBrittany Bowe, women's speedskating\n\nA former inline skater and college basketball player, Bowe is now one of several U.S. speedskaters who figure to be medal threats in Beijing.\n\nThe 33-year-old won a bronze in Pyeongchang in team pursuit – Team USA's only long track speedskating medal at those Games – and she has been arguably the nation's most dominant skater in the years since. Bowe broke the world record at 1000 meters in 2019 and has won gold at that distance at two of the past three world championships. She also finished second at another distance, 1500 meters, at the most recent world championships last year.\n\nNathan Chen, men's figure skating\n\nAfter a disappointing fifth-place finish at the 2018 Olympics, Chen has been nothing short of brilliant on the international level. He has won three consecutive world championships – all by whopping margins – and became the first U.S. man to three-peat since Scott Hamilton in the early 1980s. (Hamilton won four in a row.)\n\nIn addition to skating, Chen is also a student at Yale, where he is majoring in statistics and data science. He put his studies on pause to train for the Beijing Games but is likely to return to campus later this year with at least one individual Olympic medal – perhaps gold.\n\nJessie Diggins, women's cross-country skiing\n\nDiggins won a shocking gold medal at the 2018 Games in the team sprint event, alongside partner Kikkan Randall. It was the second Olympic medal ever won by U.S. cross-country skiers, following Bill Koch's silver in the 30K at the 1976 Innsbruck Games.\n\nIn the years since, Diggins, 30, became the first American to win the Tour de Ski – a multi-stage event that is modeled off of cycling's Tour de France. In the niche world of cross-country skiing, she quickly has become America's brightest star.\n\nSusan Dunklee, women's biathlon\n\nDunklee is in the midst of her final year as a biathlete, the end of a career that has spanned more than a decade and seen her achieve new milestones for Americans in the sport. Her silver medal at the 2017 world championships, for example, was the first-ever won by an American in biathlon – the only longstanding sport at the Winter Olympics in which the United States has never won a medal.\n\nOutside of biathlon, Dunklee has also been an advocate for sustainability and gender equity.\n\nAlex Ferreira, men's freestyle skiing\n\nIn the brief Olympic history of ski halfpipe, only one man has ever won a gold medal: American David Wise, who's done it twice. But this time around, it could be Ferreira's turn to shine.\n\nThe 27-year-old Aspen, Colorado, native finished second to Wise in the halfpipe at the Pyeongchang Games and has been on a tear in the lead-up to the Beijing Games, including wins at both Dew Tour and the U.S. Grand Prix Finals earlier this winter. There figures to be plenty of competition in this event in Beijing, especially among the Americans, but Ferreira will certainly be in the mix.\n\nTaylor Fletcher, men's Nordic combined\n\nFletcher is one of the few four-time Olympians on Team USA, which is an achievement in and of itself. He won a bronze medal at the 2013 world championships and has long been one of the nation's stalwarts in Nordic combined, which consists of ski jumping and cross-country skiing. The event has long been dominated by Europeans – including, unsurprisingly, Norway – so Fletcher faces long odds of reaching the podium.\n\nAlex Hall, men's freestyle skiing\n\nHall, 23, was born in Alaska, grew up in Switzerland, and won a silver medal in Norway at the 2016 Youth Olympic Games.\n\nThe reigning world bronze medalist in freeski slopestyle, he clinched his spot on Team USA in thrilling fashion at a Grand Prix event in January, landing a crazy run in his last attempt to win by less than a point. This will be his second consecutive Olympic appearance. He placed 16th in slopestyle in Pyeongchang.\n\nDusty Henricksen, men's snowboarding\n\nFrom Shaun White to Red Gerard, it seems like there's always an up-and-coming American snowboarder who blossoms into a star at the Olympics. And at the Beijing Games, it could very well be Henricksen.\n\nJust 18, Henricksen will be making his Olympic debut after claiming a pair of big victories in recent years. He won gold in slopestyle at the Youth Olympic Games in 2020, then followed up with a first-place finish at the Winter X Games in 2021, becoming the first American to win the event at the X Games since White in 2009.\n\nMadison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, ice dance\n\nThe U.S. is the only country to win an Olympic medal in ice dance at each of the past four Games. Hubbell and Donohue will be among those aiming to make it five.\n\nBoth are now north of 30 and have said this will be their final Olympic run, after more than a decade together. Hubbell and Donohue placed fourth at the 2018 Olympics, just a few points off the podium. But they've been in sharp form since, finishing third and second at the most recent world championships.\n\nKaillie Humphries, women's bobsled\n\nOne of the most accomplished pilots in her sport, Humphries has won three medals in three Olympic appearances for Canada dating back to 2010. The Beijing Games will be her first with Team USA.\n\nHumphries, 36, switched nationalities after filing a complaint against Canadian team officials in 2018, alleging verbal and emotional abuse. She became a U.S. citizen in December. With the Olympic debut of women's monobob, Humphries is favored to win at least one medal in Beijing, though there is a chance she could return home with two.\n\nChloe Kim, women's snowboarding\n\nKim was one of the breakout stars of the 2018 Olympics, where she won a gold medal at the age of 17. And she's heavily favored to become the first repeat winner in the women's halfpipe since its debut in 1998.\n\nAfter taking a year off from competition in 2019-20 to focus on her schoolwork at Princeton – and to \"be a normal kid for once\" – Kim has been as dominant as ever in her return to the halfpipe. The 21-year-old has racked up recent wins at the 2021 world championships and Dew Tour, among other marquee events.\n\nHilary Knight, women's hockey\n\nMore than 15 years after making her Team USA debut, Knight is back for a fourth Olympic appearance and will be one of the veteran anchors for a team that will look to repeat atop the Olympic podium this winter.\n\nAt 32, she is one of the most recognizable athletes in her sport – and still one of the most accomplished and dangerous attacking players on the ice. In 190 career games for Team USA, Knight has amassed 219 points, including 126 goals. She's also been part of eight world championship teams, on top of her Olympic successes.\n\nAlysa Liu, women's figure skating\n\nLiu, 16, had to withdraw from nationals this year after testing positive for COVID-19, but she successfully petitioned her way onto the Olympic team after a strong first season on the senior international circuit.\n\nA two-time U.S. champion and one of the few American women who can land a triple axel in competition, Liu probably has the best chance of any U.S. women of sneaking onto the podium, which the Russians are expected to sweep.\n\nJake Sanderson, men's hockey\n\nThe NHL's decision to pull out of the Beijing Olympics due to COVID-19 opened the door for younger players like Sanderson to step up.\n\nThe son of ex-NHL forward Geoff Sanderson, the 19-year-old currently plays collegiately at the University of North Dakota and was drafted fifth overall in 2020 by the Ottawa Senators. He has been a standout defenseman in the U.S. talent pipeline and captained the U.S. junior national team at its most recent world championships.\n\nKristen Santos, women's short track speedskating\n\nOriginally a figure skater, Santos switched to speedskating at 9 and won a pair of junior national championships. She barely missed out on the 2018 Olympic team, finishing fourth at those trials, where only the top three would be competing at the Games.\n\nThis time around, Santos left little doubt, sweeping the 1500-meter races at this season's trials to officially punch her ticket to Beijing, where she might represent Team USA's best shot at a medal in short track.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin, women's Alpine skiing\n\nShiffrin, 26, has quickly established herself as one of the most dominant American skiers ever – and she is without question one of the brightest stars on Team USA.\n\nWith more than 70 World Cup wins and 11 world championship medals to her name, Shiffrin will enter her third Olympics with strong odds of winning medals in multiple events – just as she did in Pyeongchang, where she took gold in giant slalom and silver in Alpine combined. Shiffrin, who tested positive for COVID-19 just six weeks before the Games, has a stated goal of competing in all five individual events in Beijing.\n\nJohn Shuster, men's curling\n\nFour years after leading Team USA to an improbable gold in Pyeongchang, Shuster is back for his fifth Olympic appearance, once again as captain of the U.S. men's team.\n\nFew U.S. winter athletes can match Shuster's longevity. The 39-year-old Minnesota native won his first national title in 2003, and competed at his first Olympics in 2006. He'll be joined in Beijing by two of the three teammates who competed alongside him in 2018, Matt Hamilton and John Landsteiner. Chris Plys replaces Tyler George to round out the team.\n\nJordan Stolz, men's speedskating\n\nThe 17-year-old Stolz has been touted as the future of U.S. men's speedskating, and he showed why at the Olympic trials in January. He won both the 500-meter and 1000-meter races at trials, breaking the 1000-meter track record set by two-time Olympic gold medalist Shani Davis in the process.\n\nA Wisconsin native, Stolz will be the third-youngest American male speedskater to compete at the Games. But U.S. teammate Joey Mantia described him as the guy who's \"going to carry that torch into the next several quads.\"\n\nKatie Uhlaender, women's skeleton\n\nNearly two decades after her first competition, Uhlaender is still going. The Beijing Olympics will be her fifth, a rare achievement for U.S. winter sports athletes. The 37-year-old has come close to the Olympic podium, finishing fourth in Sochi in 2014 by four hundredths of a second, but she has yet to win a medal.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/02/20/beijing-winter-olympics-closing-ceremony-live-updates/6860687001/", "title": "Winter Olympics closing ceremony recap: Beijing Games come to an ...", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nUpdated Feb. 20, 2022, 11:51 a.m. ET\n\nBEIJING — The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics – which had its share of triumph and controversy – come to a close Sunday.\n\nThe Games are still reeling after 15-year-old Russian Kamila Valieva was allowed to compete in the women's figure skating event, despite a positive drug test for a banned substance.\n\nBobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor will have a chance to wave the American flag at the closing ceremony after missing the opening ceremony due to COVID. Meyers Taylor will leave Beijing with a silver medal in the monobob and a bronze in the two-man bobsleigh.\n\nAfter conclusion of the Games, the Winter Olympic torch will eventually make its way to Italy, where Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo are set to share hosting duties in 2026.\n\nCheck out the photos from the ceremony.\n\n(Looking for a recap of Sunday's action? We have you covered.)\n\nOLYMPIC NEWSLETTER: All of our coverage straight to your inbox\n\nMEDAL COUNT: How every country has performed at the Beijing Games\n\nTEAM USA MEDAL COUNT: Every medal won by the US at Beijing Games\n\nBefore the closing ceremony gets underway (7 a.m. ET), here's quick recap of the major Team USA highlights that occurred while you were sleeping:\n\nIOC's Thomas Bach thanks China\n\nIn his closing address, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach nodded the challenges of these Games while congratulating the athletes and thanking the organizers.\n\nThese Olympics were the second during the coronavirus pandemic and included strict countermeasures consistent with China’s zero-COVID policy, including daily testing, masking and frequent sanitization.\n\n“If we want to finally overcome this pandemic, we must be fast, we must aim higher, we must be stronger, we must stand together. In this Olympic spirit of solidarity, we call on the international community: give equal access to vaccines to everybody around the world,” Bach said.\n\n“The Olympic spirit could only shine so brightly because the Chinese people set the stage in such an excellent way, and in a safe way.”\n\nBach thanked local organizers, public authorities and volunteers for their work organizing and hosting the Games. He also repeated organizers’ oft-cited statistic that China now has 300 million people participating in winter sports.\n\n“This unforgettable experience was only possible because of our gracious hosts, the Chinese people,” Bach said. “With the truly exceptional Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, we welcome China as a winter sports country.”\n\nWith that, he declared the Beijing Games closed.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nCeremony nears an end\n\nLike they did in 2008, the Olympic rose in the center of National Stadium and flag bearers congregated toward the middle of the stage.\n\nThe snowflake was lowered to signify Beijing as a two-time Olympics host.\n\nAfterward, the extinguishing of the Olympic flame (not the first time it’s gone out during these Games) triggered the Olympic flags to light up.\n\nA 90-second fireworks show followed.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nFake wind blows flags\n\nThe flags raised over the closing ceremony flapped in the wind. Or at least it looked that way.\n\nMechanical blowers kept the flags aloft, just as they had for the opening ceremony more than two weeks ago.\n\nThough the flags might seem to be blowing in the breeze, the sound hear during quiet moments in the ceremony gave away the rouse.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nPassing of Olympic flag\n\nIn traditional Olympic fashion, the Olympic flag is taken down and handed over from the host city to the welcoming city. The mayor of Beijing, Chen Jining, passed the flag to IOC president Thomas Bach, who then passed it to the mayors of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. The Italian national anthem then played.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nA beautiful scene\n\nJessie Diggins gets silver medal at closing ceremony\n\nJessie Diggins received the United States’ 25th medal of the Games on the grand stage.\n\nDiggins danced with her silver on the podium constructed inside of National Stadium, also known as the “Bird’s Nest,” in front of a much larger crowd than most medal ceremonies that took place in Beijing. She took second place in the women’s 30-kilometer mass start.\n\nThe U.S. finished fifth in the final medal count, behind Norway, Russia, Germany and Canada. Norway had twice as many golds as the United States with 16.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nVincent Zhou not at closing ceremony\n\nFew athletes have had worse luck at the Winter Olympics than Vincent Zhou.\n\nAfter spending the bulk of the Games in isolation, barred from participating in the individual men's figure skating competition, Zhou wrote on Instagram on Sunday night that he was not allowed to board a bus to the closing ceremony because Beijing 2022 organizers deemed him a \"close contact\" risk.\n\n\"I have tested negative 14 times in a row,\" Zhou wrote. \"I have antibodies and am not contagious whatsoever. I am 100% healthy and normal. I am double masked and would be walking outdoors with the same people I am about to travel with in a couple hours. Out of everyone marching, I would be the least at risk of transmitting to others.\"\n\nZhou, 21, tested positive for COVID-19 during a routine screening test on Feb. 6, hours after he skated in the team event, helping the U.S. win silver. He was released from quarantine last week and invited to participate in the figure skating gala earlier Sunday.\n\nLike the other eight U.S. skaters who competed in the team event, Zhou will be returning home to the U.S. without his silver medal. The International Olympic Committee declined to award the medals following a positive drug test by Russian skater Kamila Valieva, even surviving a challenge from the U.S. skaters at the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Saturday.\n\n\"I wish nothing but the best to everyone else marching tonight,\" Zhou wrote on Instagram. \"It makes me so happy and proud to know they are out there embodying everything Team USA represents and having the time of their lives.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nHow to watch closing ceremony\n\nNBC, the exclusive Olympics rightsholder in the United States, will not be showing the closing ceremony live on its linear, flagship channel.\n\nThe event, which began at 7 a.m. ET, aired live on NBC Sports, Peacock and NBCSports.com. Figure skating commentators Terry Gannon, Tara Lipinski, and Johnny Weir will host an “enhanced” primetime presentation of the ceremony at 8 p.m. ET, airing on NBC and streaming on Peacock.\n\nThe live feed available Friday morning will be via the Olympic Broadcasting Service.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nVladimir Putin, Ukraine and invasion during Olympic Games\n\nFar from the field of play, there's been a lot of speculation from foreign affairs experts and Russia and Ukraine watchers the world over as to whether Russian President Vladimir Putin could try to launch an invasion of Ukraine timed for the Games' end, or soon after.\n\nThis is not merely empty talk but stems from an informal Putin-invasion-timing precedent.\n\nRussia's leader has spent three of the last eight Olympic Games either invading a country or coming close to doing so.\n\nPutin sent troops into former Soviet Union republic Georgia, in the Caucasus region on the Black Sea, around the time of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 took place during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nAs Russia and China have courted each other's diplomatic company, there's been additional speculation that Putin could be holding off on any new assault on Ukraine because he doesn't want to anger Chinese President Xi Jinping. But like a lot of things when it comes to Putin, a former spy who shares his thinking on these matters with an extremely small circle of advisers, the jury's out on whether this timing is deliberate or just a coincidence.\n\n— Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nNew Zealand's Nico Porteous gets gold, then nod as flag bearer\n\nAt just 20 years old, Nico Porteous has crammed plenty of Olympic experiences into his young life.\n\nThe New Zealand snowboarder first won bronze in the halfpipe four years ago. During these Olympics, he won gold on a windy, frigid day during which he landed the most difficult trick going in the sport now.\n\nOn Sunday, he added one more Olympic first – flag bearer.\n\nPorteous was selected to carry New Zealand’s flag for the closing ceremony.\n\nHe received the honor just more than 24 hours after he became his country’s first male Winter Olympics gold medalist.\n\nPorteous is one of several Olympians whose success here earned them the honor.\n\nSpeedskater Isabelle Weidemann was chosen for the honor for Canada. In her second Olympics, she won gold in the team pursuit, silver in the 5000m and bronze in the 3000m\n\nNorway’s delegation selected Marte Olsbu Roeiseland to carry the flag after she won five medals, three of them gold, in biathlon.\n\nAnd the U.S. team, fittingly, selected bobsled pilot Elana Meyers Taylor.\n\nMeyers Taylor, 37, came into these Games as a threat to win gold in both the monobob, a new event, and the 2-man competition. But she tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving, and she spent six days in isolation.\n\nIt impacted her training and her mental health as Meyers Taylor was isolated from her son, Nico, whom she is nursing, and husband, Nicholas. They both tested positive, as well.\n\nOnce out of isolation, Meyers Taylor added to her Olympic legacy, which includes two silver medals as a pilot and a bronze as a brakeman in three previous Games.\n\nShe earned silver in monobob, behind teammate Kaillie Humphries, and took bronze in 2-man.\n\nWhile athletes view it as an honor to be chosen, there are fewer to choose from for the closing ceremony. That’s true in any Games, but especially these where they were subject to strict COVID countermeasures – including daily testing – and unable to leave the closed loop.\n\nThat meant many athletes left soon after they competed.\n\nMore than one-third of the 91 national Olympic committees competing in the Games will have their flags carried by volunteers. Those are almost exclusively from small delegations whose athletes likely already left.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nJessie Diggins captures last medal for Team USA at Beijing Games\n\nCross-country skier Jessie Diggins fought to the finish, claiming Team USA's final Olympic medal of the Beijing Games, a silver in the women's 30-kilometer event Sunday.\n\nWith a fierce wind on the last day of the Games, Diggins finished 1:26.37 behind Therese Johaug of Norway, who claimed her fifth career Olympic medal, and third gold in Beijing. American Rosie Brennan finished sixth.\n\nIt was the 25th Olympic medal for the U.S. team in Beijing.\n\nThis is the third career medal for Diggins, who cemented her status as the most successful American skier in her sport in Olympic history, now with gold-silver-bronze to her name.\n\n— Roxanna Scott\n\nMikaela Shiffrin doesn't medal at these Winter Olympics\n\nMikaela Shiffrin will leave the Beijing Olympics empty-handed.\n\nShiffrin and the Americans lost to Norway in the bronze-medal matchup of the Alpine team event Sunday. Each country won two races in the final, but Norway won based on the better overall time.\n\nIt was yet another unfulfilling ending for the two-time Olympic champion, who had wanted to do the team event so badly she changed her departure from Beijing after high winds pushed the race back a day.\n\nShiffrin has three medals from her first two Olympic appearances, two golds and a silver, and was expected to contend for several more here. But she only finished two of her individual events, recording Did Not Finishes in the giant slalom, slalom and Alpine combined, her best events.\n\nShe finished ninth in the super-G and was 18th in the downhill.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nCourt rejects request by US figure skaters to get their team medals before closing ceremony\n\nThe nine U.S. figure skaters who won silver medals in the team event at the 2022 Winter Olympics felt so strongly about receiving those medals before the end of the Games that they took the matter to court.\n\nBut they did not succeed.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport announced late Saturday night that it rejected the appeal the Americans filed earlier in the day, which would have forced the International Olympic Committee to hold a public medal ceremony for the team event prior to Sunday night's closing ceremony.\n\n— Tom Schad and Christine Brennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/sport/gallery/winter-olympic-athletes-to-watch-beijing", "title": "25 athletes to watch in the Beijing Winter Olympics - CNN", "text": "1.

For action from Thursday (including Wednesday night in the US), check out our updated live coverage page of the 2022 Olympics.\n\nTeam USA freeskiers kept their Olympic medal streak going in men's slopestyle Wednesday at the 2022 Beijing Games – in a big way.\n\n(Looking for a recap of Tuesday's events? We've got you covered.)\n\nAmericans won gold and silver in the event, earning Team USA a spot on the podium in the event for the third consecutive Olympics.\n\nAlex Hall shot to the top of the leaderboard with an outstanding first run, and it stood up throughout the competition to earn him the gold.\n\nNick Goepper took home the silver and now owns three medals in the freeski discipline after claiming silver and bronze in the first two Olympic competitions in 2014 and 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. men’s hockey team got knocked out of the Olympics in the quarterfinals with a shootout loss to Slovakia. .\n\nAnd in the men's aerials finals, another American trio – Justin Schoenfeld, Chris Lillis and Eric Loughran – advanced for a chance at gold. Lillis and Schoenefeld teamed with Ashley Caldwell to help the U.S. win gold last week in the Olympic debut of mixed team aerials.\n\nFigure skating has the night off (but NBC re-aired the women's short program in prime time Tuesday night). The women's competition resumes Thursday with the individual free skate.\n\nTV SCHEDULE: What and how to watch Olympics Tuesday night and Wednesday morning\n\nTEXT ALERTS: Sign up for behind-the-scenes access from our reporters on the ground\n\nOLYMPICS NEWSLETTER: All of our coverage straight to your inbox\n\nMEDAL COUNT: How each country is performing at the Winter Games\n\nJustin Schoenefeld, Chris Lillis fail to medal in men's aerials\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — Chris Lillis had been jumping brilliantly in the qualifying round on Tuesday and the first two runs of the finals on Wednesday night of the men’s aerials.\n\nBut when it came down to his final jump, he didn’t quite execute as well.\n\nInstead, China’s Qi Guangpu ripped off a precise, clean and fast back double full-full-double full (a back single layout flip with two twists, a flip with a full twist and then a single layout flip with two twists) on his final jump with a degree of difficulty of 5.0 to earn a winning score of 129.00.\n\nUkraine’s Oleksandr Abramenko took silver and Russia’s Ilia Burov took bronze.\n\nJustin Schoenefeld was fourth and Lillis was fifth, both for Team USA.\n\n\"You know, aerial skiers, we like it coming down to one jump and one winner take all, just like you saw with Qi Guangpu today,\" said Lillis. \"I got to give a shout out to him for an excellent performance. I've watched him my entire career and to see him get on the top of the podium in what might be as last season, I'm very happy for him.\"\n\nLillis had been in the third position after his first jump of back full-double full-full went so well.\n\nBut when he changed up to a back double full-full-double full for the super final he landed a bit off.\n\n\"I'm not exactly positive what speed I went through it but obviously I had a little bit too much on the flip rotation,\" said Lillis. \"Just kind of devastated not to end up on the top of the podium because I know I have that caliber of jumping in me and I've been doing that up until this point.\"\n\nSchoenefeld and Lillis had helped the U.S. mixed aerials team win gold over the favored Chinese with Ashley Caldwell.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nJohannes Klaebo of Norway won his fourth Olympic medal at Beijing\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — The clinical speed of Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo in the final stages of the men’s team sprint classic ensured Norway claimed another cross-country skiing gold medal at Beijing, ahead of Finland and ROC.\n\nIivo Niskanen (Finland) had already won gold in the 15km classic and claimed bronze in the 15km+15km skiathlon, and he handed teammate Joni Maki a small lead going into the last lap of Wednesday's final.\n\nBut Klaebo waited patiently for his moment before pressing the accelerator as the skiers entered the stadium for the final time and pulling away to take gold.\n\nIt is his fourth medal at these Games, having earlier collected gold in the individual sprint, silver in the 4x10km relay and bronze in the 15km classic.\n\nIn the women’s team sprint, there was a surprise victory for the German team of Victoria Carl and Katharina Hennig, who claimed gold ahead of Sweden and ROC.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nNo medals for Team USA in short-track speedskating\n\nBEIJING — Team USA will leave the 2022 Winter Olympics without a medal in short-track speedskating.\n\nOn the final night of competition Wednesday, the three American women in the 1500-meter field all failed to qualify for the final.\n\nKristen Santos, who narrowly missed out on a medal in the 1000 late last week, came closest to advancing. She was in the mix toward the end of her semifinal heat before colliding with Sumire Kikuchi of Japan, sending Santos off-course and Kikuchi into the pads. Because a third skater was deemed to have caused the crash, both were advanced to the \"B\" final to decide 8th through 14th place.\n\nCorinne Stoddard and Julie Letai also made the semifinals but finished fifth and eighth in their heats, respectively.\n\nTeam USA won six medals in short-track speedskating at the 2010 Olympics but only one in each of the past two Games.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nWhile you were sleeping\n\nThe U.S. dominated in freeski slopestyle, but suffered a devastating defeat on the ice. Here's what else you missed overnight while you were sleeping:\n\nFor the third consecutive Winter Olympics, the U.S. men's hockey team will not reach the podium. Team USA was defeated by Slovakia after a shootout in the quarterfinals. The defeat came in stunning fashion, as Slovakia scored the equalizer with under a minute left in regulation.\n\nAlex Hall and Nick Goepper won the gold and silver medals, respectively, in the men's freeski slopestyle competition. Since freeski slopestyle was added to the Olympic program in 2014, the Americans have medaled every Games and now have six of the nine medals awarded.\n\nRussian speedskater Daniil Aldoshkin apologized after he flashed his middle fingers Tuesday following a win against the United States in the men's team pursuit semifinals.\n\nJessie Diggins, Rosie Brennan fall short of cross country skiing medal\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — Rosie Brennan looked steady and in control on her three laps in the team sprint, staying within the middle of the pack in the first two cases and surging on the third.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessie Diggins shot of out a cannon on the exchanges, grabbing the lead – or taking her place among the leaders and holding on.\n\nBrennan’s splits were impressive, with her third and final lap her fastest at 3 minutes, 38.7 seconds.\n\nDiggins used that energy to catapult from Brennan’s final tag and jumped out to the lead right away. But she faded in the final stretch, first on the major descent and then in the all-out straightaway to the finish line. Diggins' final lap was 31 seconds slower than her first.\n\nMeanwhile the leaders all had a powerful final kick with Germany taking gold, Sweden taking silver and Russia taking bronze.\n\nBrennan and Diggins finished fifth for the U.S.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nUS women cross country skiers advance to final\n\nRosie Brennan and Jessie Diggins advanced to the final in the women’s team sprint Wednesday.\n\nThe Americans were second in their semifinal, finishing 4.1 seconds behind Germany. The race is six laps around a course of 1.5 kilometers skiing classic style.\n\nIn 2018 Diggins won gold in the team sprint with teammate Kikkan Randall, the first ever gold at the Olympics by Americans in cross country skiing.\n\nEight days ago at these Games, she made U.S. cross country history again by winning the first individual medal by an American woman, bronze in the freestyle sprint.\n\nThe women’s final in the team sprint will be held at 5:15 p.m. Beijing time (4:15 a.m. ET).\n\nGold medalist skier Alex Hall happy with decision to compete for Team USA\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — With an Olympic gold medal, Alex Hall extended the USA’s success in the Olympic slopestyle competition.\n\nBut Hall didn’t have to compete for the United States.\n\nHall, 23, was born in Alaska but raised mostly in Zurich, Switzerland, where his parents are professors. His mother, Elena Conti, is an Italian citizen. His father, Marcus Hall, is a U.S. citizen.\n\nThat gives Hall, who is fluent in German, both Italian and U.S. passports.\n\nThough he did talk with the Italian coaches about potentially competing for them, Hall opted to join the U.S. freeskiing team and moved to Park City, Utah, when he was around 16.\n\n“I think I pretty quickly realized that I wanted to ski for the U.S.,” he said. “That’s where I live nowadays, so it feels right to do for the U.S.”\n\nThough his parents still live in Switzerland, Hall has grandparents nearby in Salt Lake City. Having friends and family in the States helped him feel like it was the right decision.\n\n“The group of friends I get to hang out with on a daily basis on the team is really special,” he said. “I wouldn’t change it for a thing and I’m glad I stuck to the U.S. and have been competing for them ever since.”\n\nIt’s worked out well for the U.S. team, as well.\n\nHall entered these Games primed for a medal, having won big air and taking bronze in slopestyle at the X Games last month. Hall also took bronze in slopestyle at the world championship last year.\n\nHis Olympic gold here on Wednesday added to the country’s success in this event, where it has won six of the nine medals awarded since freeski slopestyle became part of the Olympic program in 2014.\n\nHall is the second American gold medalist in the event after Joss Christensen won in 2014 as part of a U.S. sweep.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nUS men's hockey team eliminated from Olympic tournament with shootout loss to Slovakia\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. men’s hockey team was less than a minute from making the medal round. Instead, the U.S. will have nothing to show for what was an impressive showing at the Beijing Olympics – until disaster struck in the quarterfinals against Slovakia on Wednesday.\n\nWith the goalie pulled and a one-man advantage, Marek Hrivik tied the game for Slovakia with 43.7 seconds left in regulation. In the 10-minute, sudden-death 3-on-3 overtime, neither team scored. The drought continued in the shootout until Peter Cehlarik scored on the fourth attempt. The U.S. failed to score on all five penalty shot attempts and are going home after a 3-2 defeat.\n\nSam Hentges provided a go-ahead score for the U.S. with 11:04 to go in the second period after Nathan Smith skated through the neutral zone, which the U.S. largely controlled all game, and dished the puck to Nick Perbix. Perbix found Hentges right in front of Slovakian goaltender Patrik Rybar, and the St. Cloud Sate forward easily found the back of the net for the 2-1 U.S. lead.\n\nThe score remained that way for the final 31 minutes, even though Matty Beniers (one assist) nearly added an insurance goal by hitting the post inside of 12 minutes, and the U.S. couldn't score during 1:23 of a 5-on-3 advantage before that.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nUSA takes 2-1 lead on Slovakia in men's hockey quarterfinal\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. men’s hockey team is 20 minutes away from being guaranteed the chance to play for a medal.\n\nTied 1-1 with Slovakia in their quarterfinal matchup, the Americans began flying around in the offensive zone in the second period and were rewarded with the lead.\n\nThe USA's fourth line broke through with 11:04 to go in the period when Nathan Smith skated through the neutral zone and dished the puck to Nick Perbix, who fed Sam Hentges right in front of Slovakian foaltender Patrik Rybar. The St. Cloud State forward easily found the twine, and the U.S. took a 2-1 lead.\n\nOn the defensive end, the U.S. continued sacrificing their bodies and blocking shots to keep life somewhat easy for goaltender Strauss Mann. He has 14 saves.\n\nSlovakia is outshooting the U.S. 21-15.\n\nThe U.S. will open the third period with one minute left on a power play, their first of the game.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nLate goal pulls US even with Slovakia at first intermission in men's hockey\n\nBEIJING — The U.S. knew Slovakia's Juraj Slafkovsky could present problems against them, even if he’s just 17 years old.\n\nBut the defense forgot about him during a critical possession in the defensive zone. The USA couldn’t clear a puck along the boards, and the mistake cost them. Peter Ceresnak found a wide-open Slafkovsky in the slot. His wrister past the glove of U.S. goaltender Strauss Mann made it 1-0 with 8:15 to go in the first period. Slafkovsky now leads the tournament in goals (five).\n\nIn net, Mann’s rebound control has left much to be desired. That could come back to bite the Americans, who are in a position they cannot afford such circumstances.\n\nBut as they’ve done all tournament, the U.S. answered. The transition game has been strong against Slovakia, and Kenny Agostino streaked up the ice with less than a minute left. The puck wound up on Matty Beniers’ stick, and he dished to Nick Abruzzese, whose nice move in front of Patrik Rybar tied it at 1.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nAlex Hall, Nick Goepper give USA gold, silver in slopestyle\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Americans are on the Olympics freeski slopestyle podium again.\n\nTwo-time Olympian Alex Hall won his first medal, using a unique run with difficulty and style to land at the top of the podium. Teammate Nick Goepper took silver, his third Olympic medal, and Sweden's Jesper Tjader won bronze.\n\nHall jumped out to a big lead after his first run, using long rail slides and unique jumps to take the lead. On the first jump, whose winged takeoffs make tricks more difficult, Hall landed a double cork 1620, flipping 4 ½ times while doing two off-axis flips.\n\nGoepper put down a big second run to claim his third Olympic medal. He took a unique line by using the rail atop the guard shack on the course and then landed back-to-back double cork 1440s on the final two jumps to get in podium position.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nU.S. women on the ropes with curling loss to Canada\n\nThe U.S. women’s curling team will head into its final round-robin match 4-4 and very much hanging to its medal round hopes by a thread.\n\nThe U.S. lost to Canada on Wednesday, 7-6, after Canada skipper Jennifer Jones converted a wide-open draw for the winning point. In a sense, the Americans were fortunate to even be in that position after Jones shockingly whiffed on a shot in the ninth end that would have pretty much ended the game, allowing the Americans to steal one and tie it up.\n\nBut with the hammer in the 10th, the Canadians committed to just knocking away every guard the Americans tried to put up. Tabitha Peterson, the U.S. skipper, couldn’t place her final stone in a position to put any pressure on Jones, who needed to only put something in the vicinity of the button to win.\n\nIt was one of a few moments where the Americans’ strategy seemed questionable.\n\nDown 5-3, the U.S. team got into a bit of a bind in the seventh end when Canada put three in the house, including one on the button, necessitating an extremely skillful shot from Peterson to squeeze out a point with the hammer. Instead, the best Peterson could do was knock two out, allowing Canada to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nCanada cracked the door open for the U.S. to get all three back in the eighth end with a double takeout, but Peterson elected for the safer play to score two points, hoping for another opportunity in one of the final two ends. Though the Americans did tie it up, they never got the hammer back, which proved to be decisive.\n\nThe U.S. will play its final round-robin game on Wednesday night (morning in the U.S.) against Japan and will certainly need a victory to be in contention for entry into the medal round for the first time since 2002. Even then, they will likely need some help depending on how the final round-robin games and tiebreakers shake out.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nTeam USA looks to continue surprising run in men's hockey\n\nBEIJING — Through three games, the U.S. men’s hockey team has used a combination of speed, youth and toughness to claim the No. 1 seed entering the quarterfinals and emerge as the surprise story of the tournament.\n\nOf course, that means nothing anymore. A few bad bounces, and it could mark the end of the line for the Americans in Beijing.\n\nStrauss Mann, who picked up the win in a 4-2 victory against Canada in group play, will start in net against Slovakia.\n\nSlovakia is led by Juraj Slafkovsky, a potential top 10 NHL draft pick this summer. The 17-year-old is tied for the tournament lead in goals (four).\n\nThe U.S. will have to stop him without one of its top defenders. Jake Sanderson (undisclosed injury, day-to-day) isn’t dressed for the second consecutive day.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nKaren Chen performs to 'Requiem' at 2022 Olympics\n\nBEIJING — Skating first in the final group, American Karen Chen fell on a planned triple loop jump in the second half of her program, grimacing with frustration as she left the ice.\n\n“I didn’t skate the way I wanted to skate and definitely not what I am capable of,” Chen said. “I need to just think about what went wrong and then move on into the long program.”\n\nPerforming to \"Requiem for a Dream” and “Requiem for a Tower,” Chen's score of 64.11 on Tuesday was slightly lower than her short program score in the team event earlier this month, which was 65.20. She also fell in that program.\n\nChen, 22, went on to skate a redemptive long program as Team USA won silver in the team event.\n\nThe only returning Olympian of the three American women in the field, Chen placed 10th at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. She's currently in 13th place entering Thursday's free skate in Beijing.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nAlysa Liu skates to music from Don Quixote at Beijing Games\n\nBEIJING — Alysa Liu barely stopped smiling Tuesday, from the moment she took the ice for her Olympic debut to the moment she left.\n\nSkating to “Gypsy Dance II” from Don Quixote, Liu didn't attempt the notoriously difficult triple axel, which has helped distinguish her from her compatriots, but she turned in a clean, energetic performance in her short program, recording a score of 69.50 and moving into second place at the time.\n\n“I am happy with what I did,” Liu said. “All of my training has been to get to the Olympics, and my dream has come true.”\n\nHer father, Arthur Liu, was one of the more vocal critics of the recent decision to allow Russian teenager Kamila Valieva to compete despite a positive drug test in December.\n\n\"She tested positive for a banned drug. What’s not clear about it? She should be out,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \"That is as simple as that. What kind of message are they sending to millions of young boys and girls in sports — particularly figure skaters? That cheaters are allowed to compete in the Olympics, the holiest competition on the planet. It totally destroys the Olympic spirit.\"\n\nLiu, 16, is not only the youngest member of the U.S. figure skating team, but also the youngest member of Team USA in Beijing, period. A two-time national champion, she was favored to win a third title in January but tested positive for COVID-19 in between the short program and long program, forcing her to withdraw.\n\nShe'll begin Thursday's free skate in eighth place.\n\n— Tom Schad and Chris Bumbaca\n\nAmericans Alex Hall, Nick Goepper in solid medal position in men's slopestyle\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – The U.S. men have a good chance to keep their medal streak alive in freeski slopestyle.\n\nAmericans Alex Hall and Nick Goepper lead the way with the best scores in the field entering the third and final run. Colby Stevenson, Team USA's third entrant, is sixth.\n\nSince the event was added to the Games in 2014, at least one American has medaled in each edition. In Tuesday’s qualifying at the Beijing Olympics, the U.S. trio all qualified in the top six for the final.\n\n“I still got a little bit left in the tank,” Goepper said after qualifying. “I’m more relaxed than I was eight years ago. I just think that comes with experience and age.”\n\nGoepper helped the USA start its streak, earning bronze in Sochi as part of a USA sweep in the event’s debut. Joss Christensen won gold in that competition, while Gus Kenworthy took silver.\n\nGoepper, 27, also won a silver medal in Pyeongchang four years ago.\n\nIn addition to the field – Switzerland’s Andri Ragletti is the top-ranked skier in the world this year and qualified in first – Goepper will contend with his teammates for the podium.\n\nHall, a two-time Olympian, entered these Games fresh of a gold medal in big air and a bronze in slopestyle at X Games last month.\n\nStevenson, meanwhile, has an Olympic silver medal in big air from that event’s debut last week.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nMariah Bell skates to music by Yiruma at Winter Olympics\n\nBEIJING — Mariah Bell became the oldest American woman in 94 years to compete in Olympic figure skating on Tuesday night, when she took the ice for her short program.\n\nMaking her Olympic debut, Mariah Bell, 25, performed her short program to “River Flowers in You” by Yiruma. However she fell on the second part of her triple flip-triple toeloop combination at the beginning of her program but landed her next two jumps to record a score of 65.38, which was good for second place at the time.\n\n“I have very mixed emotions about it,” Bell said. “I am bummed with the mistake on the opening element, but I am happy how I came back with everything else. Ultimately, I just really enjoyed skating on Olympic ice.\"\n\nBell, who won the most recent U.S. national championship, was the first of three American women to take the ice Tuesday. She ended up in 11th place heading into Thursday's free skate.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nOPINION: As Valieva takes the ice, American Mariah Bell upstages her where it matters\n\nHow do figure skaters choose the music for their programs?\n\nBEIJING — For casual viewers, it can be what stands out.\n\nFor Olympic figure skaters, it can help pave the way to a medal.\n\nThe music behind a figure skating program plays critical roles on multiple fronts – setting the tone of a performance, shaping the choreography and, in some cases, even helping fuel the emotion of the skaters on the ice. It can be one song, or several stitched together. Something iconic, or relatively unknown.\n\n\"There's a lot,\" American pairs skater Brandon Frazier said, when asked about the process of selecting the music for a program. \"We try to find music we relate to. That's number one. We rely heavily on our choreographer's opinion, on what they see us doing. ... But all in all, when we're skating to it, we have to feel it.\"\n\nThere's also the obvious: When you pick a song for a program, you're signing up to skate to it almost every day, for months at a time.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nWhat is trimetazidine, the heart drug at the center of Russia's doping scandal?\n\nRussian star figure skater Kamila Valieva was temporarily suspended after she tested positive for trimetazidine a month before she won the team event gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut what kind of drug is trimetazidine? TMZ is a drug used to treat angina and other heart-related conditions. It works by increasing blood flow to the heart and limiting rapid swings in blood pressure. The drug is not approved for use in the United States.\n\nSince 2014, it has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances and is categorized as a \"hormone and metabolic modulator.\" This is illegal for athletes to use both in and out of competition as it can increase blood flow efficiency and improve endurance.\n\nHer lawyer argued Valieva had accidentally taken TMZ since her grandfather uses it for his heart issues.\n\n— Gabriela Miranda\n\nTwo-time Olympic medalist living off Team USA's 'camping meals'\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — At least Nick Goepper can look forward to going back to the hotel to a nice warm home cooked ... camp-style meal.\n\nOpen lid, add hot water, stir. Every day. Sometimes a few times a day.\n\nAfter qualifying slopestyle finals with a strong run that started on the big house at the top of the slopestyle course and then ended with his final jumps – a switch double misty 1260 into a double cork 1080 on the quarter pipe jump into a double cork 1440 on the last jump – Goepper was feeling it.\n\nGoepper, a two-time Olympic medalist, was the top American in Tuesday's freeski slopestyle qualifying, in third, and advanced along with teammates Alex Hall and Colby Stevenson. The final is Wednesday.\n\n— Lori Nickel\n\nUS-born Chinese figure skater admits online criticism 'did hurt me a little bit'\n\nBEIJING — There is a California-born teenager competing for host China at the 2022 Winter Olympics receiving online hate, and it's not free skier Eileen Gu.\n\nQuite contrary to the adulation that Gu has received for embracing China, women's figure skater Zhu Yi faced harsh online criticism in China after she fell during the women's short program in the team event early in the Olympics.\n\nZhu, who moved to China last year after living the first 18 years of her life in southern California, crashed into the wall and finished last.\n\n“In the beginning, (the comments) did hurt me a little bit,\" Zhu said Tuesday. \"Of course, I was able to just see it from a different light. And just use it to my own advantage.”\n\nThe performance dropped China from third to fifth. According to CNN, the hashtag \"Zhu Yi Has Fallen\" reached 200 million views on the social media website Weibo. Zhu, whose American name is Beverly, also had been criticized online for not speaking fluent Chinese.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zhu ended the individual short program ranked 27th out of 30, meaning she didn't qualify for Thursday's free skate.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA medal count up to 17\n\nHeading into Wednesday's action in Beijing, the United States is tied with Canada for fourth in overall medals with 17, after adding a bronze in the men's speedskating team pursuit.\n\nVeteran Joey Mantia paced Team USA as it outlasted the Netherlands in the bronze medal race, giving the 36-year-old Ocala, Florida, native the first medal of his career in his third Olympics.\n\nNorway leads the total medal count with 26, including 12 gold. Germany is in second with nine gold medals, while the Russian Olympic Committee (20 total medals) and Germany (18) are just ahead of the U.S. and Canada overall.\n\nRussia's Kamila Valieva returns to the ice\n\nRussian phenom Kamila Valieva took the ice Tuesday amid international controversy after testing positive for a banned heart medication called trimetazidine. She was provisionally suspended, then reinstated upon appeal, allowing her to compete despite differing opinions between the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nValieva, 15, twisted off-axis on the first of her three jumps – the notorious triple axel – and touched the ice on her descent. But she landed the other two jumps, scoring 82.16.\n\nShe leads the women's competition heading into Thursday's free skate. The highest-ranked American in the field, Alysa Liu, is in eighth place.\n\nOPINION: As Valieva takes the ice, American Mariah Bell upstages her where it matters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}]}

It was her sixth U.S. championship appearance.\n\nGlenn's victory makes her the first openly LGBTQ+ skater to win the U.S. women's title.\n\n\"Being the first openly queer women's champion is incredible,\" Glenn said. \"When I came out originally, I was terrified and I was scared it would affect my scores or something, but I didn't care. It was worth it to see, over the last couple of years, the amount of young people that feel more comfortable in their environments at the rink.\"\n\nJosephine Lee grabbed the silver medal with a 204.13 overall score, but it was Isabeau Levito who was neck-and-neck with Glenn following Thursday's short programs. Levito was sitting in first coming into the free skate, and Glenn was less than a half a point behind in second. Neither had their best performance Friday evening.\n\nWhile Glenn was able to execute her triple axel early in the program, there were a few missed elements later in the performance that cost her points.\n\nIowa vs. Nebraska highlights: Caitlin Clark drops 38 in Hawkeyes women's basketball win\n\n\"I was just disappointed in myself again because I know that I could have brought a bit more and trusted myself to do a bit more in that second half,\" Glenn said. \"To go from that, feeling like my success was slipping away, to realizing that I had it, it was a mixture of happiness, of course. This wasn't exactly how I wanted to get my first national title but I'm incredibly thankful for it.\"\n\nWith Levito lined up to close out the event, there was an opening for her to walk out as the national champion for the second year in a row. From the beginning of her skate, however, Levito struggled, and she suffered a couple falls that led to a deduction of four points and a third-place finish.\n\n\"This evening kind of felt like a fever dream,\" Levito said. \"It was so tough going in, trying to defend the title, and I think when I first made that mistake, it kind of woke me up.\"\n\nThat crowd was treated to another bit of history within the women's free skate program during Mia Kalin's performance earlier in the event. Although she didn't finish on the podium, the 15-year-old became the first woman to cleanly land a quadruple jump (a skill with four turns, also known as a \"quad\") at the U.S. Championships.\n\nBobsledding, figure skating, hockey: See photos of the first Winter Olympics a century ago\n\nMen's Short Program\n\nIlia Malinin put himself in perfect position to defend his 2023 title, scoring a 108.57 in the short program on Friday.\n\nFinishing almost 20 points better than the second-place skater Maxim Naumov, who totaled 89.72 points, Malinin recorded the largest lead in U.S. Figure Skating Championship history after the short programs portion of the men's event.\n\nThough there was no quad axel, the move that put Malinin in the record books in 2022, the 19-year-old still lived up to his \"quad god\" nickname by executing two other quad skills.\n\nLatest from Akron: Former Olympic pole vaulter, world champ Shawn Barber dies at 29\n\n\"The audience coming out here, some of them are flying or driving a long way here to really watch us skate,\" Malinin said. \"We just have a lot of appreciation for them. ...

Team Peterson and the duo of Cory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin will also represent Team USA in the women’s curling event and mixed doubles, respectively.\n\nAll three teams will look to win Team USA's first curling medal in eight years. The U.S. has only won two curling medals in Olympic history, most notably a gold medal won by Team Shuster in the men's event at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. The U.S. hasn't made the Olympic podium in the women's or mixed doubles events.\n\nWhen did curling become a Winter Olympic sport?\n\nMen's curling was part of the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Games, but it was held as a demonstration event in 1932 at Lake Placid, in 1988 at Calgary and in 1992 at Albertville. Men and women's curling were officially added to the program for the 1998 Nagano Olympic Winter Games, while mixed doubles made its debut at Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nHow does Olympic curling work?\n\nTwo teams of four people each take turns gliding 44-pound stones down a sheet of ice toward a target that looks like a bullseye. Each match features six to 10 rounds, called ends. The stones have a handle on them, so when they are released, they curl down the ice. As the stone glides toward the target, players sweep the ice in front of it, which can affect the direction and the speed of the stone.\n\nDuring each round, teams take turns throwing eight rocks, and the team with the rock or rocks closest to the center of the target wins the end. Players can throw guards to block the target, draws to try to score or takeouts to remove the opponent's stones as each end plays out. There are three curling events:\n\nMen’s curling\n\nWomen’s curling\n\nMixed doubles\n\nWho are the top Team USA athletes in curling?\n\nCory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin : The duo is set to make its Olympic debut in mixed doubles at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games after becoming the first U.S. mixed doubles team to win gold at the world championships in 2023.

Ice dancing was added to the program at the 1976 Innsbruck Winter Olympics, and the team event was first contested at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nHow does Olympic figure skating work?\n\nSkaters perform a routine set to music and a panel of judges scores each routine based on skills and artistry. The skater or pairing with the best score wins. Men and women each have their own singles competition, but pairs skating and ice dancing feature one man and one woman skating together.

Luge sleds don’t have brakes or a steering wheel, so athletes have to use their body to navigate twists and turns at lightening speed.\n\nUSA Luge is in pursuit of its first Olympic gold medal. The U.S. has won six Olympic luge medals all-time, including three silver and three bronze medals, most recently Chris Mazdzer's bronze in the men's single event in Pyongchang in 2018. U.S. lugers will have more chances to medal with women’s doubles set to make its Olympic debut in Milano Cortina.\n\nWhen did luge become a Winter Olympic sport?\n\nLuge made its Olympic debut at the 1964 Innsbruck Winter Games. The team relay was added to the program in Sochi in 2014 and women's doubles will be contested for the first time in Milano Cortina.\n\nHow does Olympic luge work?\n\nThere are five luge events for men and women:\n\nSingles (men and women): Four heats over two days.

That the last two occurred halfway around the world, in time zones that were not friendly to U.S. audiences, made it even harder to keep them front of mind.\n\nYou will want to tune in for these Games, though.\n\nMuch like the 2024 Summer Games in Paris, Milano Cortina offers a respite from the malaise that lingers from the COVID pandemic and the divisiveness that continues to make our world feel cruel and small. For two-plus weeks, we can be united, reveling in amazing athletic performances, captivated by the personal stories of sweat sacrifice, and dazzled by the breathtaking beauty of the Dolomites and the Alps.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\n“To be able to have them back in the stands in Italy will be a perfect way to end a really blessed career,\" U.S. speedskater Brittany Bowe said.\n\nHere's your primer on the 10 biggest questions going into the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nHow spread out will these Olympics be?\n\nPut it this way: Getting around to all the venues could be an Olympic sport in itself.\n\nThe Winter Olympics always sprawl, because of the need for mountains. But the Milano Cortina Games are going to be the most geographically spread out in Olympic and Paralympic history, with a footprint just slightly smaller than the entire state of New Jersey.\n\nMost of the indoor events — hockey, speed skating, short-track speedskating and figure skating — are going to be in Milano. For the mountain events, however, organizers are making use of venues already used for World Cups and world championships. And they are not close to one another. Or close to Milano.\n\nThe trip from Milano to Cortina, where women’s Alpine, curling and the sliding sports (bobsled, luge and skeleton) will be held, is almost five hours. Livigno, site of snowboarding and freestyle skiing, is about three hours from Milano.\n\nIf you want to get to Livigno from Cortina? Pack supplies, water and something to keep yourself entertained, because it’s going to be a roughly six-hour trip. All this assumes, too, that there’s no traffic or weather delays. Given it’s the Olympics and it’s February, and the Paralympics and March, probably best not to count on that.\n\nIs the bobsled track ready?\n\nYes, though organizers cut it close.\n\nCortina’s original bobsled track, used in the 1956 Olympics, closed in 2008 because it was getting too expensive to maintain. Milano Cortina’s bid plan called for the track to be renovated, but the idea was abandoned because it was going to cost a boatload of money and there were existing tracks nearby in Switzerland and Austria that could be used.\n\nThen the Italian government raised a fuss, saying all Olympic events needed to be in Italy.\n\nWith the Games just two years away, construction on the new Eugenio Monti track began in February 2024. Though there were concerns the $136 million project wouldn’t get done in time — the IOC had Lake Placid on standby — the track was ready for test runs in the spring of 2025 and the IOC gave approval for its use.\n\n“The sliding centre in Cortina has surpassed expectations,\" Kristin Kloster, chair of the IOC’s coordination commission for Milano Cortina, said in September.\n\n“They have delivered on time. The sliding centre has been tested by athletes already and I think it's all going really, really well,” Kloster said. “So I'm impressed with the work.\"\n\nOfficial test events in November were held without fans, because construction was still being one around the sliding center. But the track drew praise from athletes.\n\n“I really love the track!” said U.S. push athlete Azaria Hill, who teamed with Kaysha Love to win silver at the test event.\n\nIs Lindsey Vonn really back?\n\nShe is, although she revealed on Feb. 3 that she suffered a torn ACL in a Jan. 30 downhill crash. She said she plans to still compete at these Games, the downhill race on Feb. 8 being her main goal.\n\n\"I'm still here. I think I'm still able to fight. I think I'm still able to try. And I will try as long as I have the ability to, I will not go home regretting not trying,\" Vonn said. \"I will do everything in my power to be in that starting gate.\"\n\nUp until the crash, it has been one of the most incredible comeback stories — ever. In any sport. Not only because Vonn is 41 and was retired for almost six years, but also because she’s skiing after having a partial knee replacement.\n\n“I have nothing to prove,” Vonn said last fall. “I’m doing it because I love it.”\n\nVonn is one of the greatest skiers in history, the Olympic downhill champion in 2010 and No. 3 on the list of career World Cup victories. But a series of injuries over the course of her career took their toll, and she retired in February 2019.\n\nFast-forward to spring of 2024, when Vonn had a partial knee replacement.\n\nReturning to ski racing wasn’t the goal. Vonn simply wanted to live a normal life and do the things she enjoyed — playing tennis, hiking, walking! — without debilitating pain. But as she recovered and found herself able to do things she hadn’t in years, Vonn wondered if ski racing was possible.\n\nShe resumed training and, in December 2024, skied in her first World Cup race in almost six years. Vonn had mixed results in her first season, but she finished by winning a silver medal in super-G at the World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\nWith a full offseason to train and fine-tune her equipment, Vonn has simply been a marvel. She won the season’s first downhill — that was World Cup victory No. 83, for those counting — and has been on the podium or near it in every other race.\n\n“All the people that didn’t believe in me, I have to thank them because it really gives me a lot of motivation,\" Vonn said after her win. \"I’m surprised that people haven’t figured that out by now. Every time you talk bad about me, it just makes me stronger and better and more motivated.\"\n\nCortina has always been one of her favorite courses: She made her first World Cup podium there, and 12 of her 83 wins came there.\n\nAthough she isn’t trying to prove anything to anyone, she is still Lindsey Vonn. She’s not interested in participation medals. She wants some real ones.\n\n“I know what I'm capable of, so I have my own expectations,” Vonn said. “I'm sure the world has their own as well, but I don't think yours will be higher than mine.”\n\nWhy should I follow Jordan Stolz?\n\nBecause he’s the Michael Phelps of his generation.\n\nStolz has dominated speed skating the last three years, sweeping the 500-, 1,000- and 1,500-meter titles at the world championships in 2023 and 2024 and winning the overall season champion at all three distances last season. He’s unbeaten in the 1,000 and 1,500 meters this World Cup season, and has won five of the nine 500-meter races.\n\nHe put the mass start back in his international program after a two-year absence, and was on the podium in two of the first four World Cups.\n\nThat means Stolz will be a gold-medal favorite in each of his individual events in Milano Cortina. Should he win all four races, it would be the most golds for a U.S. Winter Olympian since Eric Heiden famously swept all five speed skating events at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid.\n\nHeiden is the only Winter Olympian to win five golds at a single Games. Only two, Norwegian biathlon great Ole Einar Bjorndalen (2002) and Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova (1964), have won four.\n\n“There's a lot of confidence there. I had some really good (World Cup) races,” Stolz said after the Olympic trials. “Now that I'm actually planning a peak, I think it can get better. And even if it's the same, I think I still have really good chances at the Olympics.”\n\nWho else will be the stars in Milano Cortina?\n\nMikaela Shiffrin and Chloe Kim will always command the spotlight.\n\nShiffrin is a two-time Olympic champion who has more World Cup victories than any other skier, male or female. She’ll be a favorite in slalom, where she won the first five races of the season, and team combined, and a medal contender in giant slalom.\n\nKim has won gold in the halfpipe at the last two Olympics, and, if healthy after two shoulder dislocations in recent weeks, she could make it three in a row.\n\nAlso keep an eye on Jessie Diggins, a medal threat in cross-country skiing; “Quad God” Ilia Malinin, whose quadruple jumps make him almost unbeatable in figure skating; and Mystique Ro, a two-time medalist at last year’s skeleton world championships. Don’t sleep on Campbell Wright and Deedra Irwin, who have the best chance of winning the United States’ first Olympic medal ever in biathlon.\n\nLastly, U.S. captain Hilary Knight has already said these Olympics, her fifth, will be her last, and she and the U.S. women’s hockey team would like nothing better than to go out on top. Though the Americans have not won Olympic gold since 2014, they have had the upper hand on archrival Canada lately. They’ve won two of the last three world championships, including an overtime thriller last spring, and walloped Canada 24-7 in the four Rivalry Series games in the fall.\n\nSpeaking of hockey, what about the NHL players?\n\nFor the first time since 2014, NHL players will take part in the Winter Games. Every team but host Italy has at least one NHL player on its roster, and the U.S., Canada and Sweden squads are comprised entirely of NHL players.\n\n“We’ve got a really good group of young, hungry Americans that haven’t played in the Olympics before,” Jack Hughes said after the U.S. roster was announced. “We’re lucky the NHLers are back in the Olympics. Guys are pumped up.”\n\nAs are fans.\n\nSince they began competing at the Nagano Games in 1998, NHL players have made the men’s Olympic tournament better and more exciting. But the NHL (stupidly) refused to allow its players to compete in 2018 — much to the unhappiness of the players.\n\nThe league initially planned to return for the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, only for COVID to cause so many cancellations in the months leading up to the Games that the NHL said taking a three-week break would be at the expense of the regular season and playoffs.\n\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman has complained about the size and construction of the Milano Cortina rinks, but he recognizes the Olympics, and the league, both benefit from the NHL’s participation.\n\n“I think it's going to be great,\" Bettman said in October. “Listen, there are lots of reasons that I'm never thrilled about taking a couple of week break in the season. Changes a lot of things.\n\n\"But on balance, I think it'll be worth it, A) for the exposure, B) for the fan engagement, but C) and most importantly, this is and has always been very important to our players. And that's why we're doing this.\"\n\nWhat’s the status of the Russians?\n\nThis is not the start of a brain teaser, we promise.\n\nRussia remains banned by the International Olympic Committee, though there will be some Russian athletes at the Milano Cortina Games. Russia is no longer banned by the International Paralympic Committee, but no Russian athletes are expected at the Milano Cortina Games.\n\nGot that?\n\nThe IOC is maintaining the same position as it had for the Summer Games in Paris, allowing Russians and Belarussians to compete as “Individual Neutral Athletes,” or AIN in the French translation. Those athletes cannot wear their country’s colors or participate in the opening ceremony, and they will hear a generic anthem if they win a gold medal.\n\nAs of Jan. 27, 20 athletes in eight sports — Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, luge, short-track speedskating, speedskating and ski mountaineering — had been cleared to compete in Milano Cortina.\n\nThe IPC, on the other hand, lifted its ban of Russia and Belarus in September, clearing both countries to return to the Paralympics wearing their names and colors. But not all sport federations have lifted their bans, while others did not lift them in time for athletes to qualify for Milano Cortina. As a result, the IPC said In October that it didn’t expect any athletes from the two countries at the 2026 Paralympics.\n\nAny new events?\n\nBetween wanting to appeal to people in the host country and trying to attract the attention of the kids, of course there are new events.\n\nSome are relays or mixed-gender events or expansion of existing events. (Or, in the case of ski jumping, joining the 21st century). There is one new entirely new sport making its debut in 2026, however. Ski mountaineering. Or SkiMo.\n\nPopular in Italy with elite athletes and weekend warriors alike, ski mountaineering is an endurance sport where athletes climb a hill and then, once at the top, ski down it. Lightweight skis with “skins” help with the climbs, and there is a section on the ascent that has to be navigated on foot.\n\nThere will be individual sprint races for both the men and women, as well as a mixed relay.\n\nThe other new events are dual moguls, which involves head-to-head runs; women’s doubles in luge; and mixed-team in skeleton. There’s also the large hill in women’s ski jumping, which strikes a blow for equality. Women’s ski jumping has only been in the Olympics since 2014. The women were limited to the normal hill in Sochi, Pyeongchang and Beijing while the men did both the normal and large hills. Now both genders will compete on the same hills. As they should.\n\nHow are IOC’s efforts at gender parity going?\n\nThe International Olympic Committee says Milano Cortina will be the most gender-balanced Winter Games yet, with women making up 47% of the almost 3,000 athletes. That’s up from the nearly 45% in Beijing.\n\nCounting mixed-gender events, women will compete in 53.4% of the events in Milano Cortina, also a high for a Winter Games.\n\nBut there’s still work to be done. Remember how ski jumping added the large hill event for the women? It also added a super team event for men, so women still have one less event in ski jumping.\n\nWill the stars come out like they did in Paris?\n\nMariah Carey is performing at the opening ceremony, so that’s a pretty good start.\n\nParis was the place to be in 2024, with celebrities like Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Lady Gaga, Nicole Kidman and Zendaya showing up at the Olympics. You could have played a game of “Where’s Waldo?” with all the different events Tom Cruise took in.\n\nAlthough we might not see quite as many A-listers, Milano is Italy’s fashion capital and Fashion Week starts two days after the closing ceremony. Don’t be surprised if celebrities come early to take in both events.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/02/paris-olympics-2024-sport-climbing-events-schedule/74202772007/", "title": "Paris Olympics 2024: Sport climbing events and schedule", "text": "July 2, 2024, 5:58 p.m. ET\n\nFor the second time ever, sport climbing will be an event in the Summer Olympic Games.

All snowboarding events — halfpipe, parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross, big air and slopestyle — will be held at the Livigno Snow Park in the Italian Alps of Livigno.\n\nTwo-time Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim looks to win her third consecutive gold medal in halfpipe. If she accomplishes the feat, she will become the first female snowboarder to win three gold medals and the second overall snowboarder following three-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist Shaun White.\n\nHere's what you need to know about snowboarding at these Games.\n\nWhen did snowboarding become a Winter Olympic sport?\n\nSnowboarding made its Winter Olympic debut at the 1998 Nagano Games with men's and women's events for giant slalom and halfpipe. Giant slalom was revamped into parallel giant slalom for the 2002 Salt Lake City Games to feature head-to-head racing. Snowboard cross joined the party at the 2006 Turin Games, followed by the additions of slopestyle in 2014 in Sochi and Big Air at the 2018 PyeongChang Games. Mixed team snowboard cross made its debut at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.\n\nHow does Olympic snowboarding work?\n\nOlympic snowboarding includes 11 total events across five different disciplines:\n\nHalfpipe (men and women): Snowboarders look to put together a wicked run filled with stunts down an U-shaped structure.

Red Gerard (slopestyle, big air): The two-time Olympian put himself on the map at age 17 by winning a gold in slopestyle to become the youngest Olympic snowboarding champion in his Winter Olympics debut in PyeongChang in 2018. (Remember he overslept and borrowed his roommate's jacket?) He narrowly missed the podium in Beijing in 2022 with a fourth-place slopestyle finish and fifth-place big air finish, but the two-time reigning X Games champion is a favorite to win gold in slopestyle again.\n\nInternational landscape\n\nJapan's Ayumu Hirano finally broke through in men's halfpipe at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, claiming his first gold in the event after winning silver medals in Pyeongchang in 2018 and Sochi in 2014. He's a favorite to win it all and could become the first to win back-to-back golds since American Shaun White (2006 Turin, 2010 Vancouver). Hirano will have to go through Australian Scotty James, who won a silver in 2022 and bronze in 2018.\n\nThree Austrian athletes took home gold in Beijing in 2022 — Anna Gasser (women's big air), Benjamin Karl (men's parallel giant slalom), Alessandro Hämmerle (men's snowboard cross) — while Canadian snowboarders won the most overall medals in Beijing, including one gold from Canadian Max Parrot in men's slopestyle.\n\nOlympic snowboarding schedule\n\nFeb. 5: Men's big air qualification\n\nMen's big air qualification Feb. 7: Men's big air final\n\nMen's big air final Feb. 8: Women's and men's parallel giant slalom; women's big air qualification\n\nWomen's and men's parallel giant slalom; women's big air qualification Feb. 9: Women's big air final\n\nWomen's big air final Feb. 11: Men's and women's halfpipe qualification\n\nMen's and women's halfpipe qualification Feb. 12: Men's snowboard cross seeding runs through finals; women's halfpipe final\n\nMen's snowboard cross seeding runs through finals; women's halfpipe final Feb. 13: Women's snowboard cross seeding runs through finals; men's halfpip final\n\nWomen's snowboard cross seeding runs through finals; men's halfpip final Feb. 15: Mixed team snowboard cross quarterfinals through finals\n\nMixed team snowboard cross quarterfinals through finals Feb. 16: Women's and men's snowboard slopestyle qualification\n\nWomen's and men's snowboard slopestyle qualification Feb. 17: Women's slopestyle final\n\nWomen's slopestyle final Feb. 18: Men's slopestyle final\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics are here!

LOUIS — Ilia Malinin won his fourth consecutive U.S. figure skating championship on Saturday, the “Quad God” bringing the crowd to its feet in his final competition before he makes his Olympic debut at the 2026 Milano Cortina Games.\n\nThe free skate earned him a 209.78, bringing his championship-winning score to 324.88, a whopping 57.26 points ahead of second-place Andrew Torgashev and 75.72 points ahead of third-place Maxim Naumov. Malinin, who's been breaking in new skates, did three quad jumps in his free skate, what he called playing it safe.\n\n“I was coming into this one, I was a little unsure what I was gonna do, so I decided not to go for any risks and I wanted to play it safe because I know that hopefully in a few weeks I’ll have to go again,\" he said.\n\nHe said he will \"really try to get comfortable with (the new skates), and I’m sure in a few weeks they’ll be in perfect condition, so I’m really looking forward to that process.”\n\nEarlier Saturday, the ice dance duo of Madison Chock and Evan Bates captured their seventh national title, an all-time record. It’s their fifth consecutive championship and it propels them to their fourth Olympic games together. U.S. Figure Skating will announce the 2026 Olympic team on Sunday.\n\n\"The feeling that we got from the audience today was unlike anything I've ever felt before,\" Chock said after, tears welling in her eyes. \"It felt so special, I felt so much love and joy and I'm so grateful for this moment to share with everyone here and to share with Evan. It's been the most incredible, incredible career.

He’s launched himself into the air for seven quadruple jumps in a single long program at last month’s Grand Prix Final and was the first skater to land a quad Axel.\n\nMalinin’s username used to be Lutz God, but he changed it to Quad God after landing his first quad jump.\n\n“I didn’t think much about it … Days go by and people started asking, ‘Why’d you name yourself Quad God, you only landed one jump,’\" he said on Milan Magic, USA TODAY's new Olympics podcast that drops its first episode Saturday. \"And then I was like, ‘Oh, OK maybe I should be come a Quad God.’ From there I found my rhythm of landing quad after quad after quad and then of course landing the first quad axel.”\n\n“In the most humble way possible, I think it’s definitely helped my confidence in not only to skating in general but just feeling like I deserve to be recognized as who I am.”\n\nAndrew Torgashev dazzles, then gets pizza\n\nWe’ve reached the point of the lineup where the fight is on for the final men’s spots in the Olympics, and Andrew Torgashev made his case with a big statement.\n\nHe had an exceptional skate, starting with two quad toeloops to get the rhythm going and closing it with a tough choreo sequence. He got a standing ovation, and then got a box of pizza to celebrate it.\n\nHe received a season-best 182.63, and is now in first with a combined score of 267.62.\n\nJacob Sanchez's emotional free skate\n\nThe future is bright for Jacob Sanchez, as the 18-year-old put on an exceptional performance in his free skate to take first place through Group 2. He began to cry once he completed his program as the crown serenaded him with an ovation. He was then greeted by his family just outside the rink as they waved their Puerto Rican flags.\n\nSanchez has had a meteoric rise since joining the senior ranks in November 2024, putting himself in the conversation for the third and final men’s spot on the Olympic team. Regardless of whether he makes it, Sanchez is making a name for himself and will be one to watch in the next Olympic cycle.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates win 7th US figure skating championship\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates have another ice dance record.\n\nThe husband-and-wife duo have been on the podium at U.S. nationals every year since 2013. They have won five straight ice dance titles. And now they hold the record for most U.S. titles of all time, breaking a tie with Meryl Davis and Charlie White for most all-time.\n\n\"The feeling that we got from the audience today was unlike anything I've ever felt before,\" Chock said after, tears welling in her eyes. \"It felt so special, I felt so much love and joy and I'm so grateful for this moment to share with everyone here and to share with Evan. It's been the most incredible, incredible career. Couldn't have asked for anything more.\"\n\nUltimately, their free dance yielded a double-digit victory — a program score of 137.17 and a total score of 228.87, 15.22 points than the second place team of Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik.\n\nIt’s just the latest feat in what’s been a dominant season for the married couple. Since the start of 2025, they have won all but one of the seven competitions they entered, including winning the Grand Prix final in December for the third straight year.\n\nThe couple’s return to the Winter Olympics is all but official, making Milano Cortina their fourth Games. The only thing that’s eludes them in their decorated careers is that ice dance Olympic medal after finishing just short of the podium in 2022.\n\nIlia Malinin's parents\n\nMalinin was born into figure skating. His mother, Tatiana Malinina, is from the Soviet Union, Siberia specifically, and competed at 10 consecutive world figure skating championships for Uzbekistan. She finished eighth at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, the competition in which Tara Lipinski won the gold medal and Michelle Kwan the silver. Malinina finished fourth at the 1999 world championships as well, and she also competed at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, but withdrew after the short program with the flu.\n\nMalinin’s father, Roman Skorniakov, represented Uzbekistan at the same two Olympics, 1998 and 2002, finishing 19th both times. He and Malinina were married in 2000 and became skating coaches in the United States, moving to the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., where, in December 2004, Ilia was born. He took the Russian masculine form of his mother’s last name because his parents were concerned that Skorniakov was too difficult to pronounce.\n\nWho is on the US Olympic figure skating team?\n\nThe team will be named on Sunday at 2 p.m. Three men and three women singles skaters will be chosen, as will three ice dance teams and two pairs, 16 athletes in all. The USFS selection process includes past performances, focusing on the athlete’s body of work over the past two seasons.\n\nIlia Malinin, Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito are roster locks, as are Madison Chock and Evan Bates. That leaves two spots open on the men's side, two ice dance team spots and both pairs spots.\n\nHow does Ilia Malinin train for his quad jumps?\n\nMalinin shared with Christine Brennan and Brian Boitano on Milan Magic, USA TODAY's new Olympics podcast that drops its first episode Saturday, that he likes to skate a full program at least once a day, but that doesn’t mean every jump in that practice session must be a quad. It depends on how his body feels.\n\n“For me, at least the standard base can be all triple jumps, just to keep that stamina, just to keep that stamina in there. But then, of course, depending on how I feel or how the training is going, then I can say, ‘Maybe tomorrow I can go for a full quad layout or maybe do a full quad and the rest can be triples.’\n\n“I think the main focus for me is just running the whole program in itself with all the jumps, all the spins and really just getting that muscle memory in your head because I think a lot of the times, especially with me, if I do a certain amount of triple jumps and I feel comfortable with it, then I can go and the quad jumps will get a little easier for me because I’ve been practicing that muscle memory for a while.”\n\nIce dance overall standings\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates: 228.87 Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik: 213.65 Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko: 206.95 Caroline Green and Michael Parsons: 202.05 Emily Bratti and Ian Somerville: 197.29 Oona Brown and Gage Brown: 194.31 Katarina Wolfkostin and Dimitry Tsarevski: 186.60 Leah Neset and Artem Markelov: 176.46 Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani: 173.17 Amy Cui and Jonathan Rogers: 172.39 Eva Pate and Logan Bye: 170.49 Elliana Peal and Ethan Peal: 169.60 Raffaella Koncius and Alexey Shchepetov: 166.62 Isabella Flores and Linus Colmor: 160.75 Vanessa Pham and Anton Spiridonov: 158.62\n\nHere are the free dance scores.\n\nMadison Chock and Evan Bates: 137.17 total segment score, 77.89 technical elements score, 59.28 program components score.\n\n137.17 total segment score, 77.89 technical elements score, 59.28 program components score.

Ice dancing is made up of two segments, the rhythm dance and the free dance.\n\nHow does Ilia Malinin come up with his programs?\n\nIt takes an innovative mind to be as sensational as Malinin, and his creative process is far from ordinary. He said much of it comes from his love of gymnastics and acrobatics, which is the reason why he’s able to perform so much stunning jumps.\n\n“It really pushes me to push the envelope in skating, not only just in a performance aspect, but also give it even more athleticism, other than all the jumps, all the spins and all of the hard things,” he said. “It gives me a lot of fun, but at the same time, I feel like it's very useful for the sport to bring in something new, so everyone has something unique to watch.”\n\nWhen do 2026 Winter Olympics start?\n\nThe opening ceremony for the Milano Cortina Games is Feb. 6. The closing ceremony is Feb. 22.\n\nMilan Magic: Listen on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/12/10/usa-flag-football-team-olympics-2028-los-angeles/87676822007/", "title": "Team USA's flag football talent search for 2028 Olympics is on ...", "text": "Dec. 10, 2025 Updated Dec. 11, 2025, 6:52 p.m. ET\n\nFlag football will make its Olympic debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\nUSA Football is holding talent identification camps across the country to find potential Olympic athletes.\n\nCurrent national team members and interested NFL players must go through a qualification process to make the Olympic roster.\n\nFlag football is one of the fastest growing sports in the U.S., with participation increasing significantly among women and girls, but lacks an established elite athlete pipeline.\n\nSPRING, TX – Callie Brownson tugged at the brim of her black USA Football cap and surveyed the dozens of Olympic hopefuls who knelt at her feet on a turf field in a suburban recreational sports complex.\n\nBrownson explained that over the next several hours, she and other coaches would closely watch how athletes performed in drills and interacted with teammates to discern who could potentially represent Team USA when flag football makes its Olympic debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\n“We’re also looking for people worthy of wearing those three letters across your chest,” Brownson said.\n\nFlag football, known colloquially as “flag,” is one of the fastest-growing sports in the United States, where it is gaining traction mainly among women and girls. However, flag still lacks an established athlete pathway comparable to longtime Olympic sports that boast vast networks of youth clubs, college teams and high-powered professional leagues.\n\nIn the run-up to the L.A. Games, officials at USA Football, the national governing body responsible for tackle and flag football, are scouring the country for untapped potential by holding regional talent identification camps open to adults and kids ages 11 to 17.\n\nBrownson is leading those efforts in her role as USA Football’s Senior Director of High Performance and National Team Operations. She is familiar with breaking new ground.\n\nBrownson, a former Cleveland Browns assistant wide receivers coach, was the first woman to coach an NFL position group in a regular-season game and the first woman to coach full-time in NCAA Division I college football at Dartmouth. She also coached the U.S. women’s tackle football team to a world championship in 2022 and as a player won two world gold medals in 2013 and 2017 with the national tackle team.\n\n“Something I never even fathomed through my time of playing and coaching is that we would ever be using the term ‘football’ in the Olympics, and now we are,” Brownson said. “I think it’s just an incredible moment.”\n\nUSA Football gets its Olympic moment, looks to the future\n\nUSA Football’s mission is to ensure that flag football endures beyond a moment. The Dec. 7 talent identification camp in Spring, located about an hour north of Houston, was the fourth of 12 camps scheduled through next spring. At the afternoon adult session, 80 athletes – 60 women and 20 men – showed up in cleats and ran through combine tests, one-on-one drills, five-on-five drills and scrimmages.\n\nBefore the camp commenced, Brownson asked the group a question: “Who here has dreamed of being on a medal podium?” Every athlete raised a hand.\n\nAlthough 10-person Olympic flag football rosters won’t be set until 2028, the 2026 calendar year is massively significant for USA Football’s preparation. Athletes attending the talent identification camps are fighting for invitations to trials in March, to be followed by a series of national team training camps next spring and summer.\n\nFrom there, USA Football will select two 12-person rosters to compete for the men’s and women’s national teams next August at the 2026 International Federation of American Football (IFAF) World Championship in Germany, where the top three teams earn an automatic Olympic bid.\n\nUSA Football isn’t starting from scratch. The American men’s and women’s flag national teams are both global juggernauts; the men have won five consecutive world championships and the women have won the past three world championships. The U.S. men are No. 1 in the 2025 IFAF world rankings, while the U.S. women are ranked No. 2 behind Mexico.\n\nBut Brownson believes that expanding the player pool to bring in new blood is paramount to the program’s success and longevity.\n\n“It’s not just survive 2026, it’s put together programs that are Olympic-caliber so that we are starting that process now and not waiting until we select the teams in 2028 to say, ‘OK, now we got to get into that mindset,’” Brownson said. “Everybody needs to prepare as if the Olympics are right now.”\n\nNFL teams voted in May to allow NFL players to participate in flag football at the Olympics, with Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill and Green Bay Packers defensive end Micah Parsons among those expressing interest – though there are no guarantees they’d make the team. USA Football has full authority over roster selection and NFL players must go through a qualification process, though Brownson said the two organizations are still working through the specifics of that process, which she deemed “ever-evolving.”\n\nAnd what about the current members of the reigning world champion U.S. men’s and women’s national teams? They’ll have to earn their spots on the Olympic roster, too – which is totally fine, said two-time gold medalist Amber Clark-Robinson, who plays defensive back and wide receiver.\n\n“You got to have the best of the best regardless,” Clark-Robinson said. “Like who knows, I might not even be there. At the end of the day, gold is the goal. And if you don’t fit that mold, it’s no hard feelings. Especially as a competitor, you have to understand sometimes it’s not your time, you know? So I think it might shake it up a little bit, but at the end of the day, you have to respect the process.”\n\nBuilding a flag football Olympic pipeline\n\nFans tuning in to Olympic flag competition will see a game that is not unrecognizable from the NFL games that regularly grace their screens, albeit with key differences.\n\nFlag football is a noncontact, five-on-five game played on a field half the size of a tackle football field. As a result, flag is much faster than tackle and emphasizes technique over physicality.\n\nOther unique characteristics: Flag doesn’t have special teams, only offense and defense. Quarterbacks can’t run unless there’s a handoff first but they can receive passes, meaning some plays can have multiple quarterbacks. There’s also a designated blitzer seven yards off the ball who has an unimpeded path to the quarterback. Lateral passes are allowed but blocking and screening are not.\n\nClark-Robinson played three seasons of tackle football for the Atlanta Steam in the Legends Football League, then pivoted to flag after that league shut down during the pandemic. The transition wasn’t as smooth as she’d anticipated.\n\n“It was rough,” Clark-Robinson said. “I couldn’t pull a flag to save my life. I was very contacty – I had a bunch of people that called me ‘The Wrecking Ball’ because I wasn’t trying to [hit], but I was just in the mindset of being so physical. So it was definitely a switch that had to be flipped to dial back.”\n\nSunday’s camp in Texas attracted players from states as far away as Illinois and included players with backgrounds in football, track and field, soccer, basketball and lacrosse.\n\nWhile prior flag experience is considered a plus when evaluating players, USA Football is also targeting what they call “elite athlete talent transfer” – athletes who played other sports at a collegiate level or above. Clark-Robinson was a high school basketball state champion and college track and field athlete. Brownson said basketball players adapt well to flag football because of the similar physicality and pace.\n\nThe testing portion of the talent ID camp contained drills designed to emphasize translatable skills, such as the 5-10-5 shuttle drill that forces athletes to change direction within short distances, as well as exercises like a 20-yard dash and broad jump to measure athleticism.\n\nAfter that, they moved on to individual flag-specific drills that assess a player’s ability to evade flag pulls, run routes and throw accurate passes. The final component was scrimmages to see how athletes operated in a game setting.\n\n“We kind of crawl, walk, run in how we evaluate and assess them,” Brownson said.\n\nFlag football participation surging with boost from women, girls\n\nOn an adjacent field, kindergarten-age boys and girls in colorful uniforms played flag football in a local league – the type of organization USA Football hopes will be a foundation for the sport’s continued development.\n\nFrom 2015 through 2024, there was a 37% increase in flag participation among children ages 6 to 17, according to a USA Football analysis of the Physical Activity Council’s Annual Participation study data.\n\nWomen and girls are driving growth at the high school and college levels. Sixteen states have sanctioned high school girls’ flag football as a varsity sport, while 17 other states and the District of Columbia have independent pilot programs. At the collegiate level, the NAIA offers women’s flag football scholarships and granted the sport invitational status. The NCAA will vote next month on whether to add flag to its Emerging Sports for Women program in all three divisions, a step toward eventual championship status.\n\n“I think the interest has always been there, they just never had the space to do it,” Clark-Robinson said. “I think more girls are gravitating towards it because, ‘Hey, there are girls like me out here. I thought I was the only one but no, there’s 100 other girls just in the same area as me.’”\n\nUSA Football wants to tap into that interest and continue to provide opportunities. Darrell “D.K.” Taylor, the national team development program director, said USA Football works with local club teams, NFL flag programs and colleges to find athletes and coaches who can be part of the national team feeder system. Top performers from the youth talent identification camps will earn invites to USA Football’s annual Select Bowl, a precursor to selection for junior national teams.\n\n“Our goal is to unearth any possible way to identify talent in order to bring them as a part of the national team development program, so that we can make sure our eyes are on them, and then they continue to develop to one day be a part of our national team,” Taylor said.\n\nTaylor said NFL markets generally have the most robust flag football infrastructure, and each of USA Football’s talent identification camps are cohosted with a local NFL team.\n\nThe Houston Texans expanded their girls flag football program to more than 80 high schools across Texas this year. In early December, the New York Jets granted $1 million to the Eastern College Athletic Conference to launch a 15-team collegiate women’s flag league in 2026.\n\nHigher youth participation rates can have a trickle-up effect, where athletes who are given increased access to flag at a younger age perform at a higher level and enrich the sport’s talent pool.\n\nClark-Robinson is in her fourth season as head coach of the women’s flag team at the University of Saint Mary, an NAIA school in Leavenworth, Kansas. She said she is just now starting to see college players who played flag competitively in high school. As far as she’s concerned, the earlier they start, the better.\n\n“You can see the difference in these 14 year olds, these 13 year olds, because they’ve been playing for four or five years already,” Clark-Robinson said, gesturing to the field where the youth talent camp had just finished. “And when they get to college, they’ll have 10 years of experience before they even have to step on the football field there.”\n\nIf USA Football’s efforts to expand its reach are successful, the Los Angeles Games will be just the beginning for flag.\n\n“Winning in 2028 is important, but there’s no future after 2028 if we don’t build a structured pathway and provide as many opportunities as we can,” Brownson said.\n\nClark-Robinson said the Olympics are a golden opportunity for flag to gain widespread exposure and rewire misguided perceptions of the sport.\n\n“I’m excited for people to actually take it seriously and see that flag is something that can be competitive and exciting to watch. It’s not just a ‘powderpuff’ sport,” Clark-Robinson said. “Just go ahead and hop on board. Don’t wait.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/gcu/2026/01/25/gcu-asu-club-flag-football-game/88324637007/", "title": "GCU, ASU club flag football face off. Could NCAA sanction the sport?", "text": "Jan. 25, 2026, 1:04 p.m. ET\n\nIn what may soon become an official NCAA sport, Arizona State and Grand Canyon University faced each other in a club flag football game to open up the 2026 season. The two teams met on Jan. 24, with GCU defeating ASU 25-0.\n\nGCU was led by four touchdowns from junior quarterback Ella Bernier, who ended the game with a 35-yard touchdown run.\n\nBut there was much more to this game than just the actual result. Flag football, which is set to make its debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, recently took the next step toward becoming a sanctioned sport by the NCAA. Saturday night’s game was a potential glimpse of the future.\n\nThe stands at GCU’s Track Athletics Field are not the biggest, but they were filled with fans.\n\n“It’s electric,” GCU coach Brian Tice said. “This sport is growing as we speak and to have this support for two local teams, it’s amazing.”\n\nThe sidelines were also mostly filled with fans as well as the crowd cheered on both teams in the first game for the teams since flag football was officially added to the NCAA Emerging Sports program.\n\n“To see all the people that come out here, just stand on a field with no stands – I mean, give us a stadium, and we’re going to fill it,” Arizona State coach Jesse Pap said. “There’s that much energy about the sport. Coach Tice and I are both excited about it.”\n\nWith flag football in the Emerging Sports program, it is now on the pathway toward reaching NCAA status. There are certain thresholds that need to be met, but enthusiasm is building.\n\nFlag football has been one of the fastest-growing sports at the youth, high school and collegiate levels. According to the International Federation of American Football, 2.4 million kids under 17 are playing organized flag football in the U.S., while millions more participate in flag globally.\n\nRight now, flag football is only played officially at the NAIA level, which oversees small college athletics. Arizona Christian University is set to begin its first season this year, but other states have already gotten a head start.\n\nPap and Tice hope that if flag football becomes an official NCAA sport, that it will help with recruiting.\n\n“I think Arizona is overlooked, to be honest,” Pap said. “Coach Tice and I, we’re tired of seeing all of our stud Arizona athletes go to Kansas, Florida. We want to keep them in the great state of Arizona.”\n\nTice’s current roster is filled from all over the country.\n\n“We see what type of athletes we have here,” Tice said. “The sport is just growing so fast. With it going possibly NCAA, it’s going to be a big deal for us in Arizona.”\n\nFor Bernier, who was one of the first people to sign up for the club at GCU before its inaugural season in 2024, the game was a special moment. She’s from Chicago and didn’t get to play flag football in high school. Friends and family flew in from Illinois to see her play.\n\nBernier has watched the club grow since joining. There are 28 athletes on this year’s roster.\n\n“I’m so glad I’ve been here since day one,” Bernier said. “I couldn’t be more proud of the girls and the coaching staff we have today. I was here before I even knew flag football was a thing. To see it blow up overnight, in the Olympics now, the momentum is going crazy now. NFL teams sponsoring teams. It’s seriously going to be one of the next big things.”\n\nLogan Stanley is a sports reporter with The Arizona Republic who primarily focuses on high school, college and Olympic sports.

Shiffrin is looking to bounce back from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, where she walked away with no medals after multiple DNFs in her signature events (slalom, giant slalom). Vonn is set to appear in her fifth Olympic Games, despite suffering a complete tear of the ACL in her left knee in a downhill crash on Jan. 30. Cochran-Siegle, who's at his third Olympics, won silver in super-G in 2022.\n\nMen's Alpine skiing events will be held at the Stelvio Ski Centre in Bormio, while the women's events will be at the Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen did Alpine skiing become a Winter Olympic sport?\n\nAlpine skiing has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since 1936, when combined (downhill + slalom) was first contested at the 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen Games. Downhill and slalom were added to the program as separate events at the 1948 St. Moritz Winter Olympics. Giant slalom was introduced in Oslo in 1952 and super-G (also known as super giant slalom) made its debut in Calgary in 1988.\n\nHow does Olympic Alpine skiing work?\n\nAlpine skiing includes a total of 10 events, with men and women each competing in downhill and super-G, the fastest and steepest events, in addition to giant slalom and slalom, the more technical and twisty races that require skiers to zig-zag around gates or poles. The team combined will make its debut in Milano Cortina.\n\nDownhill : The event features longer distances between the gates and is considered the fastest Alpine skiing event.

Officials previously announced an inclusive theme featuring a show inside the stadium, and the festivities stretched across the clusters of the Milano Cortina Games, including satellite ceremonies in Livigno and Predazzo. The parade of nations featured athletes from more than 90 countries around the world.\n\nU.S. speed skater Erin Jackson, one of two flag bearers and the defending gold medalist in the women's 500m, stepped out with a wide smile when the Americans entered the stadium as she waved the stars and stripes, her teammates falling in behind her. The American Olympians who walked in the parade of nations in Milan received cheers from the crowd of nearly 79,000 people. In Livigno, the crowd wasn't big, but there were some “USA” chants.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports is on the ground across Northern Italy to bring you live updates throughout these Games. Here are the highlights from the opening ceremony.\n\nTeam USA gets cheers, JD Vance gets boos at opening ceremony\n\nAs U.S. Olympians walked into the stadium in matching Ralph Lauren ensembles during the Parade of Nations, choruses of cheers rang out across the crowd of spectators, until U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, were shown on the stadium's Jumbotron. At the sight of Vance waving miniature American flags from the San Siro grandstand, the crowd booed loudly. — Cydney Henderson\n\nWho lit Olympic cauldrons at opening ceremony?\n\nCORTINA D'AMPEZZO — Italy turned to some of its greatest Alpine skiers, past and present, to light the two cauldrons for these Winter Games.\n\nThree-time Olympic champions Alberto Tomba and Deborah Compagnoni lit the cauldron in Milano while Sofia Goggia, who is seeking her second Olympic gold at these Games, lit the cauldron in Cortina.\n\nDespite the late hour, all three drew cheers and loud applause as they were raised on platforms to put the torches to the sun-like cauldrons, signalling that the Milano Cortina games are officially open.\n\nAfter a nearly three-hour ceremony at San Siro Stadium in Milano and the streets of Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo, the torch appeared on the streets of Milano. It was carried by Gerda Weissensteiner, a two-time Olympic medalist in luge, and Manuela di Centa, a seven-time medalist in cross-country skiing.\n\nThe torch was then handed off, physically to speedskater Enrico Fabris in Milano and virtually to Gustav Thoni, the 1972 Olympic champion in giant slalom. Both carried their torches a short distance before handing off to Tomba, Compagnoni and Goggia.\n\nThe cauldrons were designed to emulate Leonardo da Vinci's knot engravings, according to Olympic officials. da Vinci lived in Milan for 17 years of his renowned life. — Nancy Armour\n\nOrder of countries in Olympic opening ceremony\n\nThere are 92 countries in the Winter Olympics. Greece is always the first country in the parade of nations, the host country is always last. The second to last country is the next host of the Winter Games — France, in this case. The United States, who hosts the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, went third to last. The rest of the order was alphabetical based on the Italian spelling of the countries, which is why Saudi Arabia walked fourth; it's called Arabia Saudita in Italian.\n\nHow many US athletes in 2026 Olympics?\n\nThe U.S. team for the Milano Cortina Olympics has 232 athletes, its largest-ever for a Winter Olympics.\n\nWhat Charlize Theron said at opening ceremony\n\nCharlize Theron is at the opening ceremony as a U.N. peace ambassador. She delivered a call for peace: \"Let these Gmaes be more than just sport … but a resounding call for peace everywhere.\"\n\nWho carried Olympics flags?\n\nIn Milan, it's Japanese mathmatician and politician Tadatoshi Akiba; Brazilian gymnast and two-time gold medalist Rebeca Andrade; Nigerian poet and artist Maryam Bukar Hassan; Italian writer Nicolò Govoni; Italian diplomat Filippo Grandi; Kenyan long distance runner Eliud Kipchoge; Cameroonian boxer Cindy Ngamba and the well-known Tongan flag bearer Pita Taufatofua. In Livigno, it's Italian cross-country skier Franco Nones and Italian short-track speed skater Martina Valcepina.\n\nErin Jackson, Frank Del Duca as US flagbearers\n\nOlympic speedskating champion Erin Jackson and bobsledder Frank Del Duca were the flag bearers for Team USA's delegation at the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina Winter Games.\n\nJackson, who won gold in the women's 500 meters in Beijing in 2022, will be back to defend her title and compete in the 1,000 meters as well. This marks her third Olympic appearance.\n\n\"It'll definitely give me a lot of motivation, because just walking out into opening ceremonies even without carrying the flag, it's this amazing feeling of like, ‘OK, we're here. We're at the Olympics. We're surrounded by all these amazing people who have worked so hard to get to this point,'\" Jackson said Wednesday. \"Just even being in the opening ceremonies, that's just like the start of the games, but it's always just kind of like a breathtaking feeling. I think carrying the flag is just going to add to that, and I'm really looking forward to it.\"\n\nDel Duca – a sergeant in the U.S. Army stationed in Lake Placid, New York – made his Olympic Winter Games debut in Beijing, and has been in the sport for over a decade. He is part of the U.S. Army's World Class Athlete Program (WCAP).\n\nGet our Chasing Gold Olympics newsletter in your inbox for coverage of your favorite Team USA athletes\n\nIOC president Kirsty Coventry\n\nThe president of the International Olympic Committee is Kirsty Coventry. Coventry was elected in March 2025 to succeed Thomas Bach and is the first woman to be IOC president. A swimmer, Coventry represented Zimbabwe at five Olympics and won seven medals, two of them gold. She also swam at Auburn, leading the Tigers to NCAA titles in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Coventry became an IOC athlete member in 2013 and was elected as an individual member in 2021. — Nancy Armour\n\nAndrea Bocelli's opening ceremony performance\n\nOf course Andrea Bocelli has a role in the opening ceremony. It wouldn’t be a global sporting event without him.\n\nThe Italian tenor is singing while the torch relay makes its way through the San Siro Stadium on the way to the cauldron(s) being lit. It’s not known what Bocelli will be singing, but it’s a good bet it will be Nessun Dorma. The aria from Puccini’s opera Turandot was synonymous with the late Luciano Pavarotti, who Bocelli performed with as one of “The Three Tenors.” Since Pavarotti’s death, it’s become a signature of Bocelli’s.\n\nMongolia's opening ceremony outfits\n\nPlease give me a moment to pick up my jaw off the floor. Mongolia turned heads at the 2024 Paris Olympics with its intricate ceremonial garb and the country has earned flying colors yet again. Goyol Cashmere created a Mongolian deel that effortlessly merges Mongolia’s identity and heritage with traditional garments that still feel modern. The opening ceremony look is inspired by the Great Mongol Empire of the 13th and 15th centuries, “one of the most powerful periods in our nations history,” Goyol Cashmere explains. The outfit incorporates Mongolian cashmere, silk trim and embroidery for an ornate finish that is worthy of applause. — Cydney Henderson\n\nCheck out our full style guide to the Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nTeam Italy does Federica Brignone a solid\n\nBrignone was one of Italy’s flag bearers, and she led the contingent into Cortina while riding on one of her teammates’ shoulders. Brignone, the reigning overall champion in Alpine skiing, broke her leg in April, and is still recovering.\n\nAfter completing a downhill training run earlier in the day, Brignone said she was still in pain.\n\n“I'm still not 100%, I mean not even 80%,” she said. “But it is what it is, and I have no excuses. I will try to make my best.” — Nancy Armour\n\nMariah Carey's performance at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nMariah Carey is singing two songs during the opening ceremony. One, Nothing is Impossible, is one of Carey’s own. It’s from her “Here for It All” album, released last September.\n\nThe second, Nel blu dipinto di blu, is better known as Volare. C’mon! Sing it with me! “Volare, oh, oh. Contare, oh, oh, oh, oh.” The song, inspired by paintings by Marc Chagall, first came to fame as Italy’s entrant at the 1958 Eurovision contest. While it didn’t win, it was named Billboard’s Song of the Year and won song of the year and record of the year honors at the first-ever Grammys.\n\nPrior to Carey, the song has been covered by Dean Martin, David Bowie, Frank Sinatra, Barry White and the Gipsy Kings. — Nancy Armour\n\nIs Mariah Carey Italian?\n\nCarey's mother, an opera singer, is of Irish descent and her father African-American and Afro-Venezuelan.\n\nHow many athletes at Olympics?\n\nThere are 2,900 athletes at these Winter Games from 92 countries.\n\nLaura Pausini's opening ceremony performance of Italian national anthem\n\nGrammy winner Laura Pausini sung the Italian national anthem at the opening ceremony. Italy’s national anthem is “Il Canto degli Italiani,” which translates to “The Chant of the Italians.” Though Italians often refer to it as “Inno di Memeli,” after the author of its lyrics, or “Fratelli d’Italia,” which is how the anthem beings.\n\nThe anthem was written in 1847 and became popular during Italy’s fight for independence. It was adopted as Italy’s national anthem after World War II. — Nancy Armour\n\nIs Russia banned from Olympics?\n\nOfficially, Russia is banned from the Olympics because Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. At the Milano Cortina Games, there will be no Russian flags, no Russian anthems and no Russian national colors incoporated in the competition. (The same holds true for Belarus, which has supported Russia in the war.)\n\nBut there will be athletes with Russian and Belarussian passports competing as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" or AINs for short, if they meet specific conditions. That contingent will include 13 Russians and seven Belarussians, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced Jan. 29.\n\nIf any of the AIN athletes were to win gold, a wordless anthem commissioned by the IOC would play. And none of the them will be allowed to participate in the Opening Ceremony Feb. 6. The IOC used the same procedure for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee, on the other hand, lifted its ban of Russia and Belarus in September, clearing both countries to return to the Paralympics wearing their names and colors. But not all sport federations have lifted their bans, while others did not lift them in time for athletes to qualify for Milano Cortina. As a result, the IPC said In October that it didn’t expect any athletes from the two countries at the 2026 Paralympics. — Nancy Armour\n\nWhy Shaun White was at Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThree-time Olympic gold medalist Shaun White is a part of NBC's broadcast team for the opening ceremony, particularly the parade of nations portion. He went to five Winter Games — 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022 — and won gold in snowboard halfpipe in 2006, 2010 and 2018.\n\nHow long was Olympics opening ceremony?\n\nThe opening ceremony is expected to last about 2 hours and 45 minutes. The longest part is the parade of athletes, which is scheduled to take just over an hour and 3 minutes. There is also a 30-minute pre-show.\n\nWhy does Greece go first in opening ceremony parade of nations?\n\nGreece goes first in the Parade of Nations because it’s the birthplace of the Olympics, ancient and modern.\n\nThe Olympics were a regular occurrence for almost 12 centuries in ancient Greece. When Pierre de Coubertin decided to bring them back, he chose Athens as the first site of the modern Olympic Games, in 1896. — Nancy Armour\n\nWho is Eileen Gu?\n\nLIVIGNO, Italy — Eileen Gu’s first Olympics made her one of the most famous and recognizable in China. Not bad for somebody born and raised in the United States.\n\nAs Gu continues to sidestep citizenship questions, she enters these Games with three Olympic medals from Beijing 2022 (big air gold, halfpipe gold, slopestyle silver). She’s now the most successful women’s free skier ever, with 20 victories on the World Cup circuit. She also won at the inaugural Snow League event in China in December. Gu studies at Stanford and is also involved in the fashion industry, with modeling credits for Victoria’s Secret and Louis Vuitton. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nLindsey Vonn fans in Cortina as opening ceremony festivities pick up\n\nCORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — Eager spectators walk past window shops of internationally renowned fashion houses such as Valentino, Dior and Fendi along Corso Italia in Cortina. Base shakes bars and restaurants teeming with locals and those in town from all over the world for the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. They’re passing time with an assortment of wines and beers, reflecting on the day with about half an hour until the opens ceremony begins. Overheard from an American fan with two miniature flags sticking out of her collar musing over Lindsey Vonn’s miraculous downhill training run this afternoon post ACL rupture: “She was a superstar!” And to her naysayers?: “Everyone shut up.”\n\nJust outside the Olympic fan village, young children plant the Italian flag into a mount of hard, muddy snow that’s been cleared from the brick walkway for foot traffic.\n\nInflatables of Milo and Tina — the dual mascots of these Games representing Milano and Cortina — are set up and a popular photo pop spot for fans.

The bass boomed from bars and restaurants teeming with locals and those in town from all over the world for the 2026 Winter Olympics. They passed the time with an assortment of wines and beers and reflected on the day minutes before a historic opening ceremony began.\n\nThese Games are the first ever with two Olympic cauldrons – one in Milan, one in Cortina – and multiple opening ceremony sites. Athletes walked proudly behind their countries' flags in Milan, Cortina, Livigno and Predazzo.\n\nThose competing in biathlon, women’s Alpine skiing, bobsled, luge, skeleton and curling started their leg in Cortina. They passed through an illuminated circle meant to function as “a portal and a point of orientation,” according to the ceremony media guide, while offering a contrast to verticality’s dominance on the surrounding landscape. The event culminated in the lighting of both cauldrons, designed as an homage to Leonardo Di Vinci's knots. They will glow for the entirety of these Games.\n\nNo site was as grandiose as the ceremony in Milano, where famous singer Mariah Carey performed, giant set pieces ruled the evening, and complex choreography dazzled those in San Siro Stadium. But the parade along Coso Italia in Cortina was still special. Because it allowed athletes hundreds of miles away to enjoy the experience.\n\nOPENING CEREMONY: Highlights and recap from the various Olympic sites\n\n\"I feel like there's been a lot of different, like, 'You made it' moments along the way,\" USA luger Ansel Haugsjaa said Friday. \"The teams first get announced, but then you're waiting a while. Then you go to welcome week, you know, 'Oh man, this is crazy! It's actually real.' And then you get to the village... (The opening ceremony) just feels like one of those Olympic experiences that you're always hearing about.\"\n\nIn 2022, USA Skeleton athlete Kelly Curtis said their village was a two-hour trip from the opening ceremony site. Many of her veteran teammates stayed behind and had their own personal walk rather than spending so much time on the road. Especially because they had training the next day.\n\nSo Curtis, who currently lives in Italy and works on the Aviano Air Base, was really looking forward to Friday night's festivities being so close.\n\n\"It's just incredible,\" she said Thursday. \"I'll have my family and some friends come up, and they'll be watching from balconies.\"\n\nBobsledder Frank Del Duca was the United State's flag bearer in Cortina, which made his sliding sport teammates proud.\n\n\"We all train with the bobsled and skeleton athletes, so to have Frankie as our flag bearer is something special,\" USA luger Zachary DiGregorio said, \"and we're all super excited for him with that. He's a great guy.\"\n\n∎ Get our Chasing Gold Olympics newsletter in your inbox for coverage of your favorite Team USA athletes\n\nJust outside the Olympic fan village in Cortina, young children planted the Italian flag into a mound of hard, muddy snow that had been cleared from the brick walkway for foot traffic. Fans crowded temporary metal barricades along the parade’s path. Some with their countries’ flag tied around their necks and draped thoughtfully over winter coats.\n\nCigarette smoke and steamy exhales filled the air. Half empty packs, beer glasses, and cocktail cups crowded small tables, tree stumps and front stoops. All as fans bounced between watching the Milan ceremony on large television screens and the on-site athlete parade.\n\nCortina has a rich Winter Olympic history. The city was chosen to host the Games in 1944, which did not take place because of World War II. In 1956, the opportunity came back around.\n\nCompetition included 923 athletes (only 132 women) from 32 countries, spanning 24 medal events, 11 days and eight disciplines (bobsled, ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, Alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing and ski jumping). This year's Games feature 2,900 athletes, 92 countries, 16 sports and 116 medal events. Italian cross country skier Bruno Colli, now 93, carried the torch through his hometown 70 years ago. He remembers it was -24 degrees celsius or -11.2 degrees fahrenheit. (It was about 2 degrees celsius or 36 degrees fahrenheit Friday night.)\n\nThe 1956 Games were the first broadcast live in a small handful of European countries in glorious black and white footage, as television began to take off after millions used it to watch Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.\n\nVenues built for the 1956 Olympics are still in use. Olympia delle Tofane, home to women's Alpine skiing this year, also hosted races back then. The Olympic Ice Stadium hosted 1956's opening and closing ceremonies, men's hockey and figure skating. Now it's enclosed and committed to curling.\n\nThe town once cut off from the rest of the world by the mighty Dolomites used those Games to become a fixture of international winter sport and tourism. Cortina regularly hosts FIS World Cups and skiing and curling World Championship events.\n\nBetween TV exposure and the staging of the Games accelerating pre-planned road upgrades (to the tune of 2 billion Italian lire, about $59 million today), access to Cortina improved at the perfect time. The city's population hovers around 6,000 in the low season and explodes to 50,000 during winter months. Cortina has also been filmed for iconic movies like James Bond's \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981) and \"Spider Man: Far From Home\" (2019).\n\nHotels, restaurants and bars are sprinkled all across the mountainside, peaking through heaps of snow. Olympic paraphernalia – flags and banners and temporary structures – jump out against the Italian Alpine architecture that defines the region. Wood paneling on wood paneling on wood paneling.\n\nStreet lamps are few and far between up here. But twinkly lights – likely remnants of Christmastime left up in anticipation of the Games – glowing white line drawings of winter sport logos and spotlight projections of the Italian flag are a physical manifestation of a city beaming with pride. Proud of its storied connection with the Olympics. And proud of making history on the world's biggest stage.\n\nReach USA TODAY Network sports reporter Payton Titus at ptitus@gannett.com, and follow her on X @petitus25.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/02/04/olympics-opening-ceremony-live-updates-2022-beijing-winter/6649429001/", "title": "Winter Olympics opening ceremony recap: Dazzling start to in Beijing", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nUpdated Feb. 4, 2022, 7:01 p.m. ET\n\nBEIJING — Events have been underway for three days, but the 2022 Winter Olympics officially begin Friday night with the opening ceremony.\n\nThis is the first time a venue has hosted a second Games opening ceremony. National Stadium, also known as the \"Bird's Nest,\" was also the epicenter of the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Beijing is the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games.\n\nAs is tradition, home country dignitaries and Games organizers will give speeches prior to The Delegations Parade. The first nation to enter the stadium will be Greece, followed by all other delegations in the IOC Protocol order, alphabetically by the language of the host country. Italy (as the next Winter Olympic Games host nation) and the host country China will enter last. The U.S. delegation is No. 56, after Bulgaria.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Live updates as medals will be awarded on Saturday at the Winter Olympics\n\nThe U.S. flagbearers are Elana Meyers Taylor (bobsled) and John Schuster (curling).

The final leg featured two carriers – a male and a female – to signify gender equality.\n\nAll torchbearers are past winter sports champions born in different decades, starting with the 1950s.\n\nEarlier, a children’s choir from Hebei Province sang the Olympic anthem – in Greek, the native Olympic language, following three months of practice. The Olympic oath was also recited.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard and Chris Bumbaca\n\nBeijing staffers, volunteers watch ceremony from afar\n\nBEIJING – As athletes of the world converged on the Bird's Nest, hundreds of Chinese staffers and volunteers gathered in the main hall of the Beijing 2022 media center to watch the proceedings on a jumbo TV screen.\n\nSome sat on the ground in front of the screen, while others stood on their toes with phones in their hands, attempting to capture the moment. There were loud cheers when the Chinese Olympic team was shown entering the stadium as part of the parade of nations, then a mad rush outdoors in anticipation of the fireworks display that occurred several minutes later.\n\nLike Olympic athletes and coaches, Beijing 2022 staffers and local volunteers have been required to leave their families for the duration of the Games and remain in the closed-loop system, as part of an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n– Tom Schad\n\nPita 2.0: American Samoan braves freezing temps\n\nPita Taufatofua, a Tongan athlete and opening ceremony staple known for bearing the nation's flag shirtless, is not in at the Olympics (Winter or Summer) for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe Olympian in both cross-country skiing and taekwondo will remain in Tonga as the pacific island recovers from a massive volcanic explosion last month.\n\nBut fans have not been left without a shirtless spectacle in this year's Games.\n\nNathan Crumpton, American Samoa's sole athlete who is competing in skeleton, carried the American Samoan flag glistening in oil with no shirt despite 23 degree weather in Beijing.\n\nCrumpton, born in Kenya and current resident of Utah, formerly competed with Team USA. He also competed for American Samoa in track and field at the Tokyo Games last summer. His family background allowed him to switch his athletic allegiance to American Samoa in 2019.\n\nRussia sports flag on uniform despite ‘ban’\n\nFor the second consecutive Olympics, Russia is technically barred as punishment for running a state-sponsored doping program. Instead, athletes participate as part of the “Russia Olympic Committee,” or ROC. Their flag is not supposed to be used, and their anthem is not played after gold medal victories.\n\nYet their uniform during the opening ceremony featured a Russian flag on the left shoulder. The IOC approved the fits last November, per Russian News Agency TASS.\n\nElana Meyers Taylor cheers on Team USA from isolation\n\nWearing her opening ceremony uniform while remaining isolation, Meyers Taylor posted a video via the Team USA Twitter account wishing Bowe and Schuster good luck and also extended her well wishes to the rest of the delegation.\n\n“I can’t imagine a greater honor in my career than being elected to this position,” she said.\n\nMeyers Taylor added: “If I had one piece of advice to the athletes marching in the ceremony today tonight and competing in these Olympics I would say ‘Just go out there and enjoy it. You’ve earned this moment. You have a right to be here.’”\n\nU.S. speedskater Casey Dawson's first event in jeopardy\n\nBEIJING – COVID-19 issues have delayed U.S. speedskater Casey Dawson's travel to China, and there's a chance they might now cause him to miss an event.\n\nDawson tested positive for COVID-19 three weeks ago and had been testing negative. But he wrote in an Instagram post that he recently received news that \"they now require four negative tests to even consider sending me over.\n\n“My expectation is that he’ll get here,” Matt Kooreman, long track program director for US Speedskating, said Friday.\n\nKooreman said they’re targeting an arrival date of Monday for Dawson. His first individual event is the 5,000 meters on Sunday. He would be replaced by Emery Lehman, a two-time Olympian. Dawson also qualified for the 1,500 on Tuesday and could be replaced by Ethan Cepuran.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nSnow, ice themes of athletes parade\n\nBEIJING – For the parade of athletes, organizers desired to use the story of a snowflake as a theme. Countries enter the procession being led by a placard with the country’s name on it, and the placard is in the image of a snowflake – they’re also inspired by the “Chinese knot,” an ancient craft of hand knitting with one thread.\n\nAthletes enter the stadium through a large “Gate of China” and walk under the Olympic rings that are meant to represent ice.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nOpening Ceremony not a 'full house'\n\nBEIJING – It is by no means a “full house,” but given the capacity restrictions expected due to the pandemic, several thousand attendees are here nonetheless.\n\nThey appear to be an enthusiastic bunch, even after organizers instructed fans to refrain from verbally cheering and instead clap. They gave an adoring welcome to Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping, the president of People's Republic of China, who took his perch alongside IOC president Thomas Bach before the ceremony officially began.\n\nThe only fans allowed at these Games are Chinese residents. At the Tokyo Olympics last summer, no fans were allowed at events held in the city due to COVID restrictions.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nFenlator-Victorian represents Jamaica this time around\n\nJazmine Fenlator-Victorian, the New Jersey native who notably teamed with Lolo Jones in one of the American bobsleds at the 2014 Games in Sochi, wasn’t sure she was up for the commitment of making another Olympic push this year. After deciding to leave the American program to build her own team for Jamaica, where her father was born, just making the Olympics in 2018 was considered a Herculean task. She had pretty much moved on after that to start her own business.\n\nBut Fenlator-Victorian, who carried the flag for Jamaica at the opening ceremony, decided to give it one more shot when the monobob event was accepted into the Olympic program. Thanks largely to her efforts, Jamaica is back in the bobsled competition and qualified a four-man sled on the men’s side for the first time since 1998.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nThe Bird's Nest\n\nBEIJING — The venue for the opening ceremony is Beijing's National Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest.\n\nIt has a striking, lattice shell design on its exterior made of curving steel beams.\n\nChina’s most famous artist, Ai Weiwei, helped design the stadium to symbolize freedom, openness and optimism. Ai became a staunch critic of China's Communist Party, and in a cruel twist of fate, has been living in exile in Europe for years, most recently in Portugal.\n\n“Since 2008, the government of China has further strengthened its control, and the human rights situation has further deteriorated,” Ai said in a recent interview.\n\n— Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nU.S. bobsledder returns negative test, remains in isolation\n\nBEIJING – There was one positive for Elana Meyers Taylor on a night when she should have been carrying the U.S. flag.\n\nOr, rather, a negative.\n\nThe bobsledder told USA TODAY Sports on Friday that she had again tested negative for COVID-19. Meyers Taylor needs to produce consecutive negative tests in a 24-hour span in order to be released from isolation and compete.\n\nThe three-time Olympian said Thursday that she had returned one negative test, but her second test was positive requiring her to start the process over. Monobob, the first women’s bobsled event, begins Feb. 13.\n\nMeyers Taylor was chosen by her fellow U.S. teammates to be the flag bearer at the opening ceremony along with curler John Shuster. Speedskater Brittany Bowe, who was second in the voting, will walk in place of Meyers Taylor.\n\nMeyers Taylor is a gold-medal favorite in both bobsled events, ranked No. 1 in the world in both monobob and two-man. But she tested positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 29, two days after she and her family arrived in Beijing. Her husband Nic Taylor, an alternate on the U.S. men’s team, and their toddler son Nico also tested positive.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nRussia's Putin and China's Xi bond in Beijing\n\nBEIJING – About 30 world leaders are at the opening ceremony. Not present: President Joe Biden or familiar faces from Canada, France and other European nations.\n\nMany heads of state opted for a boycott over the Chinese government's human rights record, most troubling of all in Xinjiang province in the northwest, where there is credible evidence that up to a million ethnic Uyghurs have been forcibly assimilated.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is China leader Xi Jinping's de facto guest of honor. Ahead of the ceremony, the two leaders held talks in China's capital and projected a united front over Russia's threatening buildup of troops near Ukraine.\n\n“I believe our ‘New Year’s Meeting’ today will inject more vitality into Sino-Russian relations,” Xi said according to state-run China Central Television.\n\nNoted Russia expert Dmitri Trenin said on Twitter that Putin and Xi were effectively joining together to put pressure on the U.S. in Europe and globally.\n\n— Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nCountry's lone Olympian to miss opening ceremony\n\nBEIJING – The U.S. Virgin Islands only has one athlete competing in Beijing, but skeleton racer Katie Tannenbaum said she will miss Friday's opening ceremony due to a positive COVID-19 test and is currently isolating.\n\n\"I was asked to be the Virgin Islands' flag bearer for the opening ceremonies, and it pains me not to be able to accept this honor,\" she wrote in a post on Instagram. \"But the most important thing to me is that the Virgin Islands flag will still be flown during the parade of nations. As our sole athlete at these Games, I am honored for the part I have played to help make that happen.\"\n\nTannenbaum, 36, is originally from California but moved to the Virgin Islands before she began competing in skeleton in 2010. She first became interested in the sport watching it at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. Tannenbaum is far from a medal favorite -- her best-ever World Cup finish is 20th -- but making the Olympics for the first time was a major accomplishment after she just missed out on qualifying in 2018.\n\nShe said her coach, Alex Auer, and USVI chef de mission Ansen Siglar will carry the flag in her place.\n\nShe hopes to be out of isolation in time for the skeleton competition, which begins Feb. 11.\n\n\"This is not at all how I envisioned my Olympic experience, but I am still endlessly grateful to be here,\" she wrote. \"Now I just need to get healthy and test negative before the skeleton races!\"\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nThree U.S. men's hockey players in COVID protocols\n\nBEIJING – After landing around midnight local time, the U.S. men’s team took the ice for its first practice without three of its players.\n\nJake Sanderson, Steven Kampfer and Andy Miele are all in isolation due to COVID-19 protocols. Sanderson remains in Los Angeles, where the team departed from, while Miele and Kampfer are in Beijing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Hockey News reported that USA Hockey is optimistic all three will be cleared by the team’s first game Feb. 10 against China.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA's opening ceremony uniforms\n\nFor the opening ceremony, Team USA is wearing specially-designed uniforms by Ralph Lauren.\n\n\"It feels like it’s more streetwear and fashionable, and that way it sort of integrates that sporty feel, so it’s definitely something that I would wear afterwards,\" American hockey star Hilary Knight said.\n\nThe coat is accompanied by a mid-layer jacket, pants, gloves and boots all including recycled polyester fiber from post-consumer plastic bottles. All products are manufactured in the U.S.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nToday's biggest Olympic stories\n\nIOC president won't comment on China's oppressed Uyghurs\n\nAsked in his pre-Games news conference on Thursday for his message to the Uyghur population of China, victims of genocide by the Chinese government, IOC president Thomas Bach mustered not one word of support, or even of interest, in the subject. “And with regard to… the Uyghur population, the the position of the IOC must be, given the political neutrality, that we're not commenting on political issues.\"\n\n– Christine Brennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/olympics/955662/pictures-beijing-2022-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony", "title": "Gallery: Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony - The Week", "text": "The Olympic torch was “placed into the centre of a giant snowflake, which was then illuminated to become the cauldron”, the BBC said.

And while some are staying away from the second pandemic Olympics in six months, many other world leaders attended the opening ceremony. Most notable: Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met privately with Xi earlier in the day as a dangerous standoff unfolds at Russia’s border with Ukraine.\n\nThe Olympics — and the opening ceremony — are always an exercise in performance for the host nation, a chance to showcase its culture, define its place in the world, flaunt its best side. That's something China in particular has been consumed with for decades. But at this year's Beijing Games, the gulf between performance and reality will be particularly jarring.\n\nFourteen years ago, a Beijing opening ceremony that featured massive pyrotechnic displays and thousands of card-flipping performers set a new standard of extravagance to start an Olympics that no host since has matched. It was a fitting start to an event often billed as China's “coming out.”\n\nNow, no matter how you view it, China has arrived — but the hope for a more open country that accompanied those first Games has faded.\n\nFor Beijing, these Olympics are a confirmation of its status as world player and power. But for many outside China, particularly in the West, they have become a confirmation of the country’s increasingly authoritarian turn.\n\nAs if to underline that transformation, the opening ceremony Friday was staged at the same stadium — known as the Bird’s Nest — that held the 2008 version. Back then, Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei consulted on its construction. Now, he is one of the country's best known dissidents and lives in exile.\n\nChinese authorities are crushing pro-democracy activism, tightening their control over Hong Kong, becoming more confrontational with Taiwan and interning Muslim Uyghurs in the far west — a crackdown the U.S. government and others have called genocide.\n\nThe pandemic also weighs heavily on this year's Games, just as it did last summer in Tokyo. More than two years after the first COVID-19 cases were identified in China’s Hubei province, nearly 6 million human beings have died and hundreds of millions more around the world have been sickened.\n\nThe host country itself claims some of the lowest rates of death and illness from the virus, in part because of strict lockdowns imposed by the government aimed at quickly stamping out any outbreaks. Such measures instantly greeted anyone arriving to compete in or attend the Winter Games.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Olympics, China’s suppression of dissent was also on display in the controversy surrounding Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai. She disappeared from public view last year after accusing a former Communist Party official of sexual assault. Her accusation was quickly scrubbed from the internet, and discussion of it remains heavily censored.\n\nIn the shadow of those political issues, China put on its show. As Xi took his seat, the performers turned toward him and repeatedly bowed. A simultaneous cheer went up from them, and they raised and waved their pom poms toward their president — China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. A barrage of fireworks, including some that spelled out “Spring,” announced that the festivities were at hand.\n\nA line of people dressed in costumes representing China's varied ethnicities passed the national flag to the pole where it was raised — a show of unity that the country often puts on as part of its narrative that its wide range of ethnic groups live together in peace and prosperity.\n\nPolitics elbowed its way into the proceedings, if gently. The parade of athletes from Taiwan — the island democracy that China says belongs to it — was greeted with a cheer from the crowd, as were the Russian competitors. An overcoated Putin stood and waved at the delegation, nodding crisply as they marched.\n\nThe stadium was relatively full — though by no means at capacity — after authorities decided to allow a select group to attend events.\n\nOnce the cauldron is lit, as with any Olympics, attention will shift Saturday — at least partially — from the geopolitical issues of the day to the athletes themselves.\n\nAll eyes turn now to whether Alpine skiing superstar Mikaela Shiffrin, who already owns three Olympic medals, can exceed sky-high expectations. How snowboard sensation Shaun White will cap off his Olympic career — and if the sport’s current standard-bearer, Chloe Kim, will wow us again. And whether Russia’s women will sweep the medals in figure skating.\n\nAnd China is pinning its hopes on Eileen Gu, the 18-year-old, American-born freestyle skier who has chosen to compete for her mother’s native country and could win three gold medals.\n\nAs they compete, the conditions imposed by Chinese authorities offer a stark contrast to the party atmosphere of the 2008 Games. Some flight attendants, immigration officials and hotel staff have been covered head-to-toe in hazmat gear, masks and goggles. There is a daily testing regimen for all attendees, followed by lengthy quarantines for all those testing positive.\n\nEven so, there is no passing from the Olympic venues through the ever-present cordons of chain-link fence — covered in cheery messages of a “shared future together” — into the city itself, another point of divergence with the 2008 Games.\n\nChina itself has also transformed in the years since. Then, it was an emerging global economic force making its biggest leap yet onto the global stage by hosting those Games. Now it is a burgeoning superpower hosting these. Xi, who was the head of the 2008 Olympics, now runs the entire country and has encouraged a personality-driven campaign of adulation.\n\nGone are the hopeful statements from organizers and Western governments that hosting the Olympics would pressure the ruling Communist Party to clean up what they called its problematic human rights record and to become a more responsible international citizen.\n\nThree decades after its troops crushed massive democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of Chinese, the government locked up an estimated 1 million members of minority groups, mostly Muslim Uyghurs from its far-western Xinjiang region, in mass internment camps. The situation has led human rights groups to dub these the “Genocide Games.”\n\nChina says the camps are “vocational training and education centers” that are part of an anti-terror campaign and have closed. It denies any human rights violations.\n\nSuch behavior was what led leaders of the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada, among others, to impose a diplomatic boycott on these Games, shunning appearances alongside Chinese leadership while allowing their athletes to compete.\n\nOutside the Olympic “bubble” that separates regular Beijingers from Olympians and their entourages, thousands of people, bundled up in winter jackets, gathered west of the stadium hoping for a distant glimpse of the fireworks, but they were pushed back by police.\n\nElsewhere in the city, others expressed enthusiasm and pride at the world coming to their doorstep. Zhang Wenquan, a collector of Olympic memorabilia, said Friday that he was excited, but that was tempered by the virus that has changed so much for so many.\n\n“I think the effect of the fireworks is going to be much better than it in 2008,” he said. “I actually wanted to go to the venue to watch it. ... But because of the epidemic, there may be no chance.”\n\n— AP video producers Olivia Zhang and Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2026/02/06/team-usa-2026-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony-reception/88544770007/", "title": "Team USA cheered, JD Vance booed at Winter Olympics opening ...", "text": "Updated Feb. 6, 2026, 4:59 p.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: Follow Olympics opening ceremony live updates from Milano Cortina.\n\nMILAN — Team USA entered Friday's opening ceremony at San Siro Stadium on a chilly night in Milan to mark the symbolic start of the 2026 Winter Olympics. But unlike the weather, the Americans received a warm welcome.\n\nAs U.S. Olympians walked into the stadium in matching Ralph Lauren ensembles during the Parade of Nations, choruses of cheers rang out across the crowd of spectators, until U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, were shown on the stadium's Jumbotron. At the sight of Vance waving miniature American flags from the San Siro grandstand, the crowd booed loudly.\n\nThe U.S. was the third-to-last country to enter, preceding France, host of the 2030 Winter Games in the French Alps, and host country Italy, which traditionally ends the Parade of Nations. The U.S. team was led by speed skater Erin Jackson, who proudly waved the American flag on a stage situated under gold Olympic rings.\n\nThe Parade of Nations was simultaneously held across four locations, with American athletes entering separate venues across Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina, depending on which venue hosted the athlete's event. Bobsledder Frank Del Duca served as the American flag bearer in Cortina.\n\nVance received verbal jeers as the country's political turmoil under the Trump administration plays out across global headlines. Ahead of the opening ceremony on Friday, staged protests against U.S. immigration's reported presence in Italy were held in Milan. A U.S. Olympic official confirmed that ICE agents weren't part of the country's delegation on Thursday, but the official couldn't confirm if agents were assisting the U.S. embassy's security plan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has frequented domestic sporting events, including the College Football Playoff National Championship Game in Miami last month and Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans last year, but he was absent from the 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony. Instead, Vance led a U.S. delegation that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tom Fertitta, the U.S. ambassador to Italy.\n\nVance was seated next to the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, and President of the International Olympic, Kirsty Coventry. Vance's initial appearance appeared to go unnoticed by spectators, which instead cheered at the introduction of Mattarella. But the crowd let their feelings be known during the Parade of Nations.\n\nThe Israeli delegation was also booed earlier in the Parade of Nations, while Ukraine received a lengthy applause.\n\nEarlier Friday, Vance met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and took in several performances during the team figure skating event.\n\nFollow Cydney Henderson on X @CydHenderson\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nHow many athletes compete in the Winter Olympics?\n\nFrom fan favorites like ice hockey and snowboarding to new events such as women’s monobob and freestyle skiing aerials, there are plenty of opportunities to impress.\n\nThere are 91 delegations competing for 109 gold medals across seven sports in Beijing.\n\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), there will be approximately 2,900 athletes doing their best in their selected disciplines.\n\nWhether it’s going as fast as you can or performing the most extravagant maneuver on ice possible, it’s going to be one hell of a show.\n\nA general view inside the stadium as fireworks are set off during the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics at the Beijing National Stadium on February 04, 2022 in Beijing, China. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nAre athletes allowed to make political statements?\n\nThe Olympics has witnessed some powerful moments when politics rather than sports take center stage.\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games, US shot putter Raven Saunders raised her hands and crossed them in an X as she and her fellow medal winners posed for photos, despite it going against IOC rules, telling NBC that it represented “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet.”\n\nWhether athletes competing in Beijing will use their platform to make political statements remains to be seen.\n\nIn January, a Beijing 2022 official said athletes who demonstrate behavior that “is against the Olympic spirit, especially against Chinese laws and regulations” will face “certain punishment.”\n\nRecently former Olympic cross-country skier Noah Hoffman told CNN that he is “scared” for the safety of athletes who might be contemplating speaking out about human rights issues during Beijing 2022.\n\nSecond-placed USA's Raven Saunders gestures on the podium with her silver medal after competing the women's shot put event during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo on August 1, 2021.

The competitor with the fastest combined time wins the event.\n\nAfter British and American holiday goers constructed the first toboggan run in 1882 in Davos, Switzerland, a new steel sledge was built 10 years later – which became known as the skeleton.\n\nIt fell in and out of the Olympic program for a number of years, before it was reintroduced at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nThere will be just six medals available across two events at Beijing 2022, including the men’s singles and the women’s singles.\n\nGreat Britain and the United States are the two main frontrunners in the skeleton event, having earned 11 medals between them.\n\nGerman Skeleton athlete Alexander Gassner trains at the National Sliding Centre in Yanqing, China, on February 2, 2022.

As with last year’s Summer Olympics, a raft of Covid-19 countermeasures have been put in place ahead of the Games, which will again take place in a Covid-safe “bubble” system.\n\nWhen the Games do finally get underway with the opening ceremony on February 4 – lasting until the closing ceremony on February 20 – close to 3,000 athletes will compete in 15 disciplines across 109 events.\n\nBeijing will then also host the Paralympic Games, which run from March 4-13.\n\nHow will the Games be staged amid the pandemic?\n\nOrganizers intend to hold Beijing 2022 in a closed loop system which will only be accessible for Games participants – a plan that has remained in place amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.\n\nAs outlined in a Games playbook published in December, the closed loop system will encompass venues, official hotels and the event’s own transport service.\n\nFully vaccinated participants will be able to enter the closed loop without quarantining, while those who aren’t vaccinated will need to quarantine for 21 days upon arrival in Beijing.\n\nMedical exemptions, considered on a case-by-case basis, may be granted to those who are unvaccinated. Some countries, such as the US and Canada, have mandated that all team members be vaccinated.\n\nDuring the Games, participants will be subject to daily health monitoring and testing and will have no contact with the general public.\n\n“The loop is very safe. It’s a place that I would say is very difficult to compare with any other place in the world at this point in time, because we have here a fully vaccinated, often boosted population that is being tested daily with a PCR and living in a closed loop,” Pierre Ducrey, Olympic Games operations director for the International Olympic Committee (IOC), told reporters on January 12.\n\nDucrey added: “It is called a closed loop for that very reason. It means there will be no contact between people outside the loop and inside the loop. It has been built to protect the population inside, and also the population outside.”\n\nReturning a confirmed positive test will mean participants cannot compete or continue their role in the Games; those who are symptomatic will stay at a designated hospital for treatment, while those who are asymptomatic will be transferred to an isolation facility.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China faces host of challenges as Winter Olympics loom 02:38 • Source: CNN China faces host of challenges as Winter Olympics loom 02:38\n\nLast month, Huang Chun, a member of the local organizing committee, accepted that the Games could bring “Covid-19 cases or small clusters of infections” into China given that “a large number of overseas personnel will gather, causing a very high risk of transmission.”\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, the country has implemented a zero-Covid policy of mass testing, extensive quarantines and snap lockdowns to eradicate any emergence of the virus.\n\nWill fans attend?\n\nTickets for the Games will not be sold to the general public in response to the pandemic, but instead distributed by authorities, the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee announced on January 17.\n\n“In terms of the grim and complex situation of epidemic prevention and control [and] in order to protect the health and safety of Olympic personnel and spectators, we have decided to change the original plan of public ticket sales,” the committee said.\n\nAudiences will still be required to “strictly comply with Covid-19 prevention and control requirements before, during and after watching the Games,” the committee continued.\n\nThe announcement comes after Beijing reported its first case of the highly transmissible Omicron variant on January 15.\n\nWhere are the venues?\n\nWhile the Chinese capital of Beijing is the official host city of the Games, venues are spread across three areas: Beijing, Yanqing – a mountainous district 75 kilometers (about 46.6 miles) northwest of Beijing – and Zhangjiakou, a skiing and snowboarding destination a further 100 kilometers (about 62.1 miles) beyond Yanqing.\n\nOf the 13 venues hosting events, one – the National Speed Skating Oval – has been newly built in Beijing, while existing venues have also been renovated for the Games.\n\nThe Beijing National Stadium, commonly referred to as The Bird’s Nest, will host the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nEach of the three zones has its own Olympic Village, while all three are connected by a newly built, intercity railway.\n\nThe National Aquatics Center (left) and the National Indoor Stadium (right) will both host events during the Winter Olympics.

JADE GAO/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Paralympic website, Shuey is the same pronunciation as the Chinese character for ‘snow,’ the first Rhon means ‘to include, to tolerate,’ and the second means ‘to melt, fuse and warm.’\n\nWhat is the political controversy surrounding Beijing 2022?\n\nThe US, Canada, Australia and the UK are among the countries to have announced diplomatic boycotts of the Winter Olympics.\n\nThat means that athletes from those countries will still be able to compete in Beijing, but no government officials will be in attendance.\n\nIn December, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the boycott would serve as a “clear message” against China’s “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”\n\nAccording to the US State Department, up to two million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to have passed through detention centers in Xinjiang, which the Chinese government insists are “vocational training centers” aimed at poverty alleviation and combating religious extremism.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bob Costas shares personal story on Beijing's playbook of repressing criticism 02:48 • Source: CNN Bob Costas shares personal story on Beijing's playbook of repressing criticism 02:48\n\nFollowing the announcement of the US diplomatic boycott, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the US should “stop politicizing sports and hyping up the so-called ‘diplomatic boycott’ so as not to affect China-US dialogue and cooperation in important areas.”\n\nAs for athletes, the controversies around the Games can present a moral dilemma. Last year, US skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin, a three-time Olympic medalist, told CNN that “you certainly don’t want to be put in the position of having to choose between human rights, morality versus being able to do your job.”\n\nWho are the athletes to watch?\n\nShiffrin, who has recently returned to alpine skiing’s World Cup circuit after contracting Covid-19, is set to be one of the most high-profile athletes in Beijing. At the last Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, she won gold in the giant slalom and silver in the alpine combined.\n\nOther familiar faces on the US team will include snowboarder Shaun White, who anticipates that this will be his last Olympics, 2018 halfpipe gold medalist Chloe Kim – the youngest woman to win an Olympic gold in snowboarding – and popular figure skater Nathan Chen.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Chloe Kim looks for 2022 Olympics glory 04:36 • Source: CNN Chloe Kim looks for 2022 Olympics glory 04:36\n\nTwo-time figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu from Japan will go up against Chen in his bid to win a third consecutive gold medal in the men’s singles event.\n\nMikael Kingsbury, the most decorated mogul skier of all time, will also be heading to Beijing to try and defend his title from 2018.\n\nChina, not as dominant at the Winter Olympics compared to the Summer Games, won nine medals in 2018.\n\nAmong the host nation’s best prospects of winning gold this time is American-born freestyle skier Eileen Gu, who won world championship titles in halfpipe and slopestyle last year.\n\nAccording to sports data company Gracenote, Norway – whose athletes often excel in cross country skiing and biathlon – is predicted to top the medal table with 45 medals ahead of the Russian Olympic Committee with 32, Germany with 25, and the USA and Canada with 22.\n\nWhy is North Korea going to miss the Games?\n\nOne country to have announced that it will not be sending athletes to Beijing is North Korea.\n\nAccording to state-run news agency KCNA, a letter sent from North Korea’s Olympic Committee and Ministry of Physical Culture and Sports to its Chinese counterpart cited “hostile forces” and the worldwide pandemic as the reasons for its non-participation, accusing the United States and its allies of trying to prevent the successful opening of the Olympics.\n\nThe US and its allies are getting “evermore undisguised in their moves against China aimed at preventing the successful opening of the Olympics,” the letter, which did not explicitly cite diplomatic boycotts, said.\n\nLast year, the IOC suspended the North Korean Olympic Committee until the end of 2022 as part of its punishment for its “unilateral decision” to drop out of the Tokyo Olympics, effectively barring the country from formally competing in Beijing.\n\nThe IOC said at the time that if any North Korean athletes were to qualify for the Winter Olympics through processes already taking place, it “will take an appropriate decision in due course for the athlete(s) concerned.”\n\nNorth Korean athletes did compete at the 2018 Games, with athletes from the North and South marching together under one flag at the Opening Ceremony.

Of the eight fastest qualifiers, the teams that post the two best times in Round 1 will meet for the gold medal.\n\nFaulkner shocked the cycling world earlier in Paris when she won the gold medal in the women's road race, the first time an American has won the event in 40 years. — Dave Birkett\n\nCuban wrestler wins fifth straight Olympic gold then immediately retires\n\nPARIS — A Cuban wrestler made Olympic history Tuesday, and perhaps put himself in the conversation as one of the greatest Olympic athletes ever.\n\nMijaín López became the first Summer Olympian in any individual sport to win five consecutive gold medals in the same event, a masterful feat of longevity and dominance that he reached by defeating Chile's Yasmani Acosta, 6-0, in the 130-kilogram final in Greco-Roman wrestling at Champ-de-Mars Arena.\n\nWhen it was over, López picked up his coaches in a pair of bear hugs before walking to the center of the mat and untying his shoes. In the international symbol for a wrestler's retirement, he removed his shoes, left them on the mat and walked away.\n\nNicknamed \"El Terrible\" for his imposing figure and sheer dominance, López won his first Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Games in Beijing, when he was 25 years old. He won his fifth just a few weeks shy of his 42nd birthday. — Tom Schad\n\nUS figure skaters will get 2022 Olympic gold medals — under Eiffel Tower\n\nThe Kamila Valieva doping saga, one of the most controversial, arduous and infuriating scandals in Olympic history, reaches its long-awaited conclusion Wednesday evening at the base of the Eiffel Tower when, for the first time in history, Winter Olympians will receive their gold medals at the Summer Olympics.\n\nExactly 2½ years to the day after the team figure skating competition ended at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, U.S. figure skaters will get their gold medals and their Japanese counterparts their silvers at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics\n\nRussia dropped from first place to third after Valieva was suspended for four years and her Olympic results were disqualified, but since Russia is not allowed at the Paris Olympics due to the war in Ukraine, their skaters will not be allowed at the medal ceremony and will receive their bronze medals elsewhere, probably in Russia at some later date.\n\nAll nine skaters on the U.S. team, their coaches and several members of each of their families flew to Paris on Tuesday courtesy of the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nMedal ceremony outfits have been made for the Americans by the USOPC, which the skaters will wear at the Paris Olympics’ Champions Park for the ceremony beginning at 5 p.m. Wednesday. — Christine Brennan\n\nUSWNT's latest Olympic win shows how far team has come in a year\n\nLYON, France — Exactly one year ago, the U.S. women’s national team was at the lowest point in its illustrious history, knocked out of the World Cup in the quarterfinals in what was the team’s earliest exit ever at a major international tournament.\n\nOn Tuesday, they reached the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n“It means everything,” said Sophia Smith, whose sublime goal in the 95th minute made the difference in the 1-0 win over Germany.\n\n“We had a tough year last year. In every way possible,” Smith said. “But I feel like this is a new year and we’re really just showing the world that we didn’t ever drop off. We just needed a learning year and a growth year and we’re back. And, hopefully, on top after this next game.\n\nThe USWNT will face Brazil Saturday, Aug. 10 at 11 a.m. ET in the gold medal match. — Nancy Armour\n\nRead more about the UWSNT's one-year turnaround in Nancy Armour's column.\n\nTeam USA's Sarah Hildebrandt advances to gold medal wrestling match\n\nAmerican Sarah Hildebrandt got out early in the women's 50kg wrestling semifinals with a snap-down, go-behind takedown to go up 2-0 on Mongolia's Otgonjargal Dolgorjav, a two-time world silver medalist. While Dolgorjav was in on a single-leg shot, Hildebrandt slipped out of the Mongolian's grasp and countered with a single-leg takedown of her own. After a passivity point, she led 5-0 going into the second period and held on for a victory.\n\nHildebrandt, despite a significant height advantage, broke free or held on for a whistle on three shots that Dolgorjav was in deep on her legs to secure a shutout victory. While Dolgorjav had gotten the best of her on two occassions at the world championships prior, Hildebrandt was the more technically sound and tougher wrestler in this match.\n\nHildebrandt will face India's Vinesh Phogat, who has bursted onto the scene for the first time as a three-time Olympian by defeating Japan superstar Yui Susaki (four-time world champion and Tokyo Olympic gold medalist) in the first round. She is a two-time world bronze medalist. — Eli McKown, Des Moines Register\n\nImane Khelif has a shot at Olympic boxing gold after semifinal win\n\nPARIS – Imane Khelif will be fighting for gold.\n\nThe Algerian boxer advanced to the finals of the women’s welterweight division Tuesday night with a victory over Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng at Roland-Garros Stadium.\n\nIt was Khelif's third victory in as many fights at the Paris Olympics, earning her a spot in the gold medal match Friday despite being dragged into a controversy over gender eligibility.\n\nKhelif, 25, previously beat Thailand’s Suwannapheng in the semifinals of the 2023 world championships. Soon after that bout, Khelif was disqualified for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests, according to the International Boxing Association (IBA), a discredited group that has no role in the Olympics.\n\nThe IOC said Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting, another female boxer disqualified at the 2023 world championships, both met all criteria to participate in the women's competition. They also competed at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nLike Khelif, Lin has excelled here inside the ring. She won each of her two fights by unanimous decision and has advanced to the semifinals in the women’s featherweight division. — Josh Peter\n\nU.S. men's basketball team cruises to Olympic semifinals\n\nPARIS – If U.S. men’s basketball coach Steve Kerr hammered home his points of emphasis against Brazil to reporters, imagine what he told his team ahead of Tuesday’s quarterfinals matchup.\n\nDefend and rebound, and the rest will take care of itself, Kerr said in a variety of ways after the U.S. completed group play and advanced to the knockout stage.\n\nHis players listened.\n\nThe U.S. did exactly that on its way to a 122-87 victory against Brazil, advancing to Thursday’s semifinals where it will face Serbia. The winner will play the winner of France-Germany for the gold medal.\n\nThe U.S. outrebounded Brazil when it mattered, held Brazil to 42% shooting and relied on its offensive firepower to put up points.\n\nDevin Booker led the U.S. with 18 points, and Joel Embiid finished with 14 points and seven rebounds. Kevin Durant scored 11 points, and LeBron James added 12 points, nine assists and three steals. The U.S. shot 58% from the field and 48% on 3-pointers\n\nBruno Caboclo scored a game-high 30 points for Brazil. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nBrazil beats Spain in women's soccer semifinal, will face USWNT for gold\n\nBrazil earned a date with the U.S. women's national team this weekend with Olympic gold on the line.\n\nBrazil jumped out to a big 3-0 lead over Spain in the second women's soccer seminal before putting away the defending World Cup champions 4-2. Brazil and the USWNT will face off Saturday, Aug. 10 at 11 a.m. ET in the gold-medal match.\n\nBrazil took a 2-0 halftime lead into the locker room after goals by Irene Parades and Gabi Portilho. Brazil surged to a 3-0 lead on a headed goal by Adriana, before Spain finally got on the board late in regulation on Salma Paralluelo's goal. Brazil made it 4-1 with a breakaway goal in the first minute of extra time. Kerolin's timely interception left her unguarded and sprinting towards goal. She fired the ball between Spanish keeper Cata Coll's legs to give Brazil a three-goal lead.\n\nBut Spain wasn't done and neither was Salma Paralluelo. After scoring her team's first goal in the 85th minute, notched her second of the match in the 12th minute of stoppage time. But the deficit was too much to overcome for Spain, who will now face Germany for the bronze medal.\n\nUSA falls in women's beach volleyball quarterfinals\n\nNo Americans are left in women's beach volleyball after the pair of Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng fell to Tanja Hueberli and Nina Brunner of Switzerland in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe Swiss won the first 21-18 after falling behind early in the match. And, despite a late rally by the Americans in the second set to tie it at 19-all, Hueberli and Brunner scored two straight points to get the decisive second set win.\n\nThe only U.S. pair left in beach volleyball at the Paris Olympics is on the men's side. Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh will play in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nBrazil dominating Spain in women's soccer semifinal\n\nBrazil jumped out to a huge 3-0 lead over Spain in the second women's soccer semifinal of the 2024 Paris Olympics before the defending Women's World Cup finally got on the board in the closing minutes of regulation.\n\nAn attack by Brazil leads to mayhem in front of the goal, but Adriana's header off a headed pass from Gabi Portilho put As Canarinhas up 3-0 in the 72nd minute. Spain countered with a goal by Salma Paralluelo in the 85th minute, off an assist by Jennifer Hermoso, to make it 3-1.\n\nThe winner of this match plays the United States in the gold medal match on Saturday. The loser faces Germany for bronze.\n\nU.S. men's basketball team up big on Brazil at halftime of quarterfinal\n\nPARIS — Joel Embiid hears the boos from the French fans. It doesn’t bother him. Or at least it didn’t in the first half of the U.S. quarterfinals game against Brazil.\n\nEmbiid scored a team-high 14 points and had seven rebounds as the U.S. took a 63-36 lead into halftime against Brazil.\n\nBrazil had a trimmed a 19-point deficit to 42-34, but the U.S. the half on a 21-4 run. LeBron James had 10 points and eight assists, and his final assist of the half came on an out-of-bounds alley-oop to Jayson Tatum just before the buzzer. Devin Booker had nine points for the U.S. which had 11 of its 12 players who played in the first half score points.\n\nThe U.S. shot 59% from the field and 50% on 3-pointers and held Brazil to 34% from the field and 29% on 3-pointers. The U.S. also limited Brazil’s offensive rebounds to four, and it entered the game as the best offensive rebounding team in the tournament at 13 per game.\n\nRight now, it’s too many defenders, rebounders and scorers for Brazil to handle. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nAmit Elor wins gold for USA, cements her status as rising wrestling star\n\nPARIS — Team USA's Amit Elor won the first gold medal of her promising wrestling career Tuesday at the 2024 Paris Olympics, crushing her latest opponent in the women's 68-kilogram weight class − Meerim Zhumanazarova of Kyrgyzstan − just like she has crushed almost everyone else who has stepped onto the mat with her over the past four-plus years.\n\nElor's 3-0 victory in the gold-medal match at Champ-de-Mars Arena gives her 41 consecutive victories at the international level, across age divisions, dating back to 2019. It also makes Elor, 20, the youngest Olympic gold medalist in the history of U.S. wrestling and just the third American woman to take gold, joining two of her idols: Helen Maroulis and Tamyra Mensah-Stock.\n\nElor has won eight world championships in three different age divisions − including senior, under-23 and under-20 titles in each of the past two years. — Tom Schad\n\nGabby Thomas wins gold, Brittany Brown bronze for USA in women's 200\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The gold medal in the women’s 200 is coming back to the U.S.\n\nGabby Thomas took an early lead around the curve and had a comfortable advantage after 100 meters. Thomas sprinted toward the finish line down the home stretch and crossed the line in 21.83, a few meters ahead of everyone else. She was the only sprinter to run a sub-22 in the race.\n\nSaint Lucia’s Julien Alfred, the gold medalist in the 100, took the silver medal at 22.08 and Team USA’s Brittany Brown got bronze, running a 22.20.\n\nAmerican McKenzie Long finished seventh at 22.42.\n\nThomas is the first American to win an Olympic gold medal in the 200 since Allyson Felix won gold at the 2012 London Games. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBahrain runner wins women's steeplechase in Olympic record time\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Bahrain’s Winfred Yavi won an exciting 3,000-meter steeplechase.\n\nYavi jumped over the final barrier, ran past Uganda’s Peruth Chemutai and crossed the finish line with an Olympic record time of 8:52.76. Chemutai took second, running a 8:53.34 and Kenya’s Faith Cherotich finished third at 8:55.15.\n\nYavi danced and celebrated around the track after her gold-medal win.\n\nAmericans Courtney Wayment and Valerie Constien finished 12th and 15th, respectively. — Tyler Dragon\n\nUSA defeats Hungary to reach women's water polo semifinals\n\nNANTERRE, France — Team USA women’s water polo defeated Hungary, 5-4, in the last quarterfinal match on Tuesday to keep its Olympic run alive. Playing for a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal, the Americans won to advance to the semifinals match against Australia, which topped Greece, 9-6, earlier in the day.\n\nIn a hard-fought contest, the two teams were fairly even throughout the match, and Team USA had a 3-2 lead after two quarters. Tied at 4-4 midway through the fourth quarter, a goal from Rachel Fattal delivered the go-ahead score and ultimately sealed the victory for the Americans.\n\nTeam USA’s captain Maggie Steffens led the team with two goals, and goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson made 17 saves on 21 shots on the day at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nThe other semifinal match features Spain, which topped Canada, against Netherlands, which beat Italy in the quarterfinals Tuesday.

Paredes scored in the 15th minute with Brazil controlling the attack in the early minutes. Then, in the waning minutes of the first half, Brazilian striker Gabi Portilho buried a shot from the center of the box to the bottom right corner of the net to make it 2-0.\n\nThe winner of this match plays the United States in the gold medal match, Saturday in Paris.\n\nUSA's Annette Nneka Echikunwoke wins silver in women's hammer\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — American Annette Nneka Echikunwoke is an Olympic medalist.\n\nThe 28-year-old, whose previous best finish at a world championship with 12th, had her greatest day of 2024, throwing a season-best 75.48 meters (247 feet, 7¾ inches) to earn the silver medal in the women's hammer throw at the Paris Games.\n\nEchikunwoke’s silver gives the Americans medals in each of the throwing events so far, after Ryan Crouser won men’s shot put for the third consecutive Olympics, and Valarie Allman won women’s discus gold for the second consecutive Games. Neither javelin final has happened yet.\n\nCanada’s Camryn Rogers, who competed at the University of California in college, won gold with a throw of 76.97 (252 feet, 6¼ inches), which she tossed on her fifth attempt. Until that heave, it looked like Echikunwoke would might win.\n\nThe bronze went to Jie Zhao of China, who threw 74.27 (243 feet, 8 inches).\n\nThe other American in the final, Deanna Price, finished 11th with a throw of 71.00 (232 feet, 11¼ inches). — Lindsay Schnell\n\nAmericans Cole Hocker, Yared Nuguse take gold and bronze in men's 1,500\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Cole Hocker stunned Great Britian’s Josh Kerr and Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win the men's 1,500 in dramatic fashion.\n\nHocker was in fourth place during the final lap but had one final kick left with roughly 60 meters to go and shockingly ran by favorites Kerr and a fading Ingebrigtsen as the crowd cheered.\n\nHocker crossed the line in first and immediately threw his hands up in jubilation as the scoreboard displayed that he had run an Olympic record 3:27.65 to win gold. Hocker becomes just the fourth American to win an Olympic gold medal in the 1,500.\n\nKerr finished second in a nation record 3:27.79 and fellow American Yared Nuguse snuck in to get the bronze, running a personal-best 3:27.80. It's the first time Team USA has had two medalists in the men's 1,500 in 112 years.\n\nIngebrigtsen took a disappointing fourth place and was in disbelief at the finish. Ingebrigtsen won gold at the Tokyo Olympics and Kerr got the bronze. This year’s 1,500 was supposed to be a showdown between the two, but Hocker stole the show and set the Olympic record. — Tyler Dragon\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone leads three Americans into women's 400 hurdles final\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone looks like her usual spectacular self, and that’s bad news for everyone else.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone easily won her heat — what else is new? — in the women’s 400 hurdles semifinals Tuesday evening at Stade de France, turning in a 52.13 in a race where she barely looked like she was trying. McLaughlin-Levrone is the world record holder (50.65), and heavy gold medal favorite. In this race, everyone is basically running for silver. She turned in the best semifinal time by more than fourth-tenths of a second.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone has said she wants to go below 50 seconds, and given her history of world records on the biggest stages, anything seems possible in Thursday’s final. At the very least it seems like a given that McLaughlin-Levrone will set a new Olympic record, which currently sits at 51.46. She set that in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nAmerican Jasmine Jones also qualified, finishing second in her semifinal at 53.83. The third American hurdler, Anna Cockrell, also advanced to the final, using a strong kick to pull in front of Jamaica’s Shiann Salmon. Cockrell finished in 52.90. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nUSWNT beats Germany to reach soccer's gold medal match\n\nLYON, France — The United States women’s national soccer team defeated Germany, 1-0, in the semifinals on Tuesday to advance to the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nSophia Smith scored a goal in overtime, assisted by Mallory Swanson, to keep the Americans’ chances of winning their first gold since 2012 alive. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher made an incredible save with her foot deep into extra time to keep Germany off the board.\n\nThe USWNT will face the winner of Spain vs. Brazil, which kicks off at 3 p.m. ET, on Saturday in Paris. — Nancy Armour\n\nFrance lineup change pays off vs. Canada in men’s basketball quarterfinal\n\nPARIS – French coach Vincent Collet made a massive lineup change ahead of France’s quarterfinal game against Canada, a game in which the loser was knocked out without a chance to medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Collet benched Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier, who each started the three games in group play, and the jolt worked.\n\nFrance advanced to the semifinals with an 82-73 victory against Canada Tuesday at Bercy Arena. It will play Germany Thursday for a spot in the gold-medal game.\n\nFrank Ntilikina, Nic Batum, Isaia Cordinier, Victor Wembanyama and Guerschon Yabusele started for France, which took an early 19-5 lead. The defense forced Canada to miss 10 of its first 12 shots and commit five turnovers.\n\nYabusele scored 22 points, Cordinier scored 20 and Fournier added 15, and Gobert logged just four minutes.\n\nFrance phenom Victor Wembanyama did not have a great offensive game (just seven points on 2-for-10 shooting), but he had 12 rebounds, five assists, three steals and one block and kept Canada’s guards from scoring at will in the paint.\n\nCanada shot 38% from the field, 24% on 3-pointers and put France on the line 42 times. France outscored Canada 33-18 from the free throw line. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led Canada with 27 points, and RJ Barrett had 16 points. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nU.S. women's volleyball team sweeps Poland to reach semifinals\n\nThe United States women's volleyball team made short work of Tuesday's quarterfinal, sweeping Poland 25-22, 25-14, 25-20 to move into Thursday's semifinal against powerhouse Brazil.\n\nThe Brazilians haven't dropped a set in four matches in these Olympics. They swept the Dominican Republic in a quarterfinal earlier Tuesday.\n\nAgainst Poland, the U.S. rolled through the first two sets in a total of only 45 minutes of playing time. The Americans then overcame a 7-1 deficit to start the third set, rallying to take the lead at 15-14 and eventually close out the match to advance within one victory of another Olympic medal.\n\nThe U.S. has earned a medal in women's volleyball in each of the past four Olympics, including a gold in Tokyo. Brazil beat Team USA for gold medals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, while the Americans won the final match against Brazil in 2021.\n\nIn pool play in 2024, the Americans lost their first match of the Olympics against China but rebounded to edge Serbia 3-2 in a critical second match. From there, the U.S. hasn't lost a set, sweeping host France and Poland. — Gentry Estes\n\nUSA women's soccer vs. Germany: Sophia Smith breaks through with extra time goal\n\nIt took extra time, but Sophia Smith netted the first goal in the USA vs. Germany women's soccer tilt on Tuesday, giving the USWNT the 1-0 lead in the 95th minute.\n\nAll three Americans qualify for 400 final\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Quincy Hall looks ready for the 400 final.\n\nHall raced around the track and had a clear lead ahead of all the other sprinters at the 300-meter mark. Down the homestretch, Hall maintained a five-meter lead over his competitors and cruised to the finish line in 43.95 to win his semifinal heat.\n\nHall won the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in the event. His season-best of 43.80 is the second fastest time in the world this year.\n\nGrenada’s Kirani James ran a season-best 43.78 to win the second heat. While U.S. sprinter Christopher Bailey finished third, running a 44.31. Bailey’s time was good enough to advance to Wednesday’s final.\n\nIn the third and final semifinal heat, Great Britian’s Matthew Hudson-Smith took his foot off the gas with 20 meters remaining and coasted to a 44.07 to win. Hudson-Smith has the fastest time in the world this year (43.74).\n\nMichael Norman finished second in the heat (44.26) to secure the other automatic qualifying spot.\n\nThe top two in each heat, plus the next two fastest times advanced to the 400 final.\n\nOlympic wrestling: American Sarah Hildebrandt heads to gold medal match\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, Sarah Hildebrandt tasted Olympic glory. Now, she has an opportunity to make it sweeter.\n\nHildebrandt, the reigning Olympic 50kg bronze medalist in women's wrestling, will grapple in the final on Wednesday. The 2021 Games medalist defeated Mongolia's Otgonjargal Dolgorjay to advance to the final.\n\nHildebrandt will face India's Vinesh Vinesh.\n\nUSWNT vs Germany scoreless in first half\n\nThe U.S. recorded six shots (five on target) the first half, but weren't able to get one in the back of the net.

Instead, the American women will have to wait until the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nWettstein ended up sixth in the eight-person final after finishing the preliminaries second overall. Her score of 88.12, which came on her first run, wasn’t enough in a finals in which the women threw down. Wettstein fell in the second and third rounds.\n\nAustralia’s Arisa Trew, 14, took gold; she entered Paris as the No. 2 park rider in the world. No. 1-ranked and defending silver medalist Hiraki Cocona, who will turn 16 later this month, of Japan repeated with silver.\n\nGreat Britain’s Sky Brown, who at 13 years old won bronze in Tokyo three years prior, took bronze again.\n\nTrew took the lead in the final round with a splendid 45 seconds of skating. The judges rewarded her with a 93.18 to move into first. Hiraki’s final run bumped her ahead of Brown but she could not leapfrog Trew. – Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA basketball TV schedule\n\nStart time: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nUSA Network is airing the game, Peacock is live streaming it.\n\nUSWNT lineup today\n\nGoalkeeper: Alyssa Naeher\n\nAlyssa Naeher Defenders: Crystal Dunn, Tierna Davidson, Naomi Girma, Emily Fox\n\nCrystal Dunn, Tierna Davidson, Naomi Girma, Emily Fox Midfielders: Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Sam Coffey\n\nRose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Sam Coffey Forwards: Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson, Sophia Smith\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count?

USA TODAY Sports will provide live updates, highlights and more from the tilt.\n\nSimone Biles discusses 'pin trading' with husband Jonathan Owens\n\nJonathan Owens seems to have gotten the full taste and experience of the 2024 Paris Olympics — including some inside pin trading.\n\nThanks to the Chicago Bears granting him some time away from training camp, Owens was able to watch his wife, decorated women's gymnast Simone Biles, win several Olympic medals, including helping the USA women's gymnastics team return to gold in the team-all-around event.\n\nAnd while the first-year Bears safety was able to take in the excitement and history of Biles becoming of the most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast (both men or women), Biles told TODAY's Hoda Kotb Tuesday morning that he was just as excited to pin trade at the Paris Games.\n\n\"He was so excited. He was more excited to pin trade,\" Biles said. \"He was loving to pin trade. I didn't think he would but I did warn him that pin trading was really huge. So he absolutely loved that.\" – John Leuzzi\n\nOlympic basketball: Nikola Jokic, Serbia hold off Patty Mills and Australia in OT\n\nPARIS – Trailing by 24 points in the second quarter against Australia, Serbia chipped away at the deficit until it took a fourth-quarter lead – only to watch Patty Mills force overtime on a jump shot with two seconds left in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, Serbia has three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic. The Serbian star scored consecutive buckets in the final 67 seconds of overtime, lifting Serbia to a 95-90 victory over Australia in a their men’x 5x5 basketball quarterfinals game Tuesday.\n\nJokic (Denver Nuggets) had 21 points, 14 rebounds, eight assists and four steals, and Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atlanta Hawks) had 17 points, six assists and five rebounds for Serbia. Mills (free agent) scored 20 of his 26 points in the first half, and teammate Josh Giddey (Chicago Bulls) scored 25 points for Australia.\n\nAustralia led 44-20, bit Serbia cut that to 54-42 at halftime and took a lead in the third quarter.\n\nSerbia will play the USA-Brazil winner in the semifinals Thursday. – Jeff Zillgitt\n\nPARIS — Before her third and final run of the women’s park skateboarding preliminaries, Bryce Wettstein wished she could slow down time.\n\n“I think when you work that hard to get here, and you’re like, ‘I’m here, I need to enjoy it,’” Wettstein said. “So I’m feeling out of this world … that was my dream run.”\n\nWettstein laid down a run oozing with confidence, difficulty and skill that resulted in a 85.65 from the judges. But before the score even showed up on the video board at Place de Concorde on Wednesday, the 20-year-old pumped both of her arms through the air.\n\nThe score placed her in second place entering finals, which took place later in the day.\n\nWettstein fell early in her first run and posted a 75.22 in the second, which would have left her on the cusp of making finals. She told herself to remove the doubts and go full swing. − Chris Bumbaca\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — The Canadian Olympic Committee has revoked the accreditation of Rana Reider, the personal coach for track and field athlete Andre de Grasse, on its Olympic team, amid recent allegations of sexual and emotional abuse. Reider also coaches Italian Olympian Marcell Jacobs and American Trayvon Bromell.\n\nThree lawsuits have been filed in Broward County, Florida against Reider and the track club he runs, among a list of other defendants.\n\nThe first complaint, which was filed in December 2023, lists the plaintiff as Jane Doe and includes an allegation of rape.

Mariah Bell finished 11th while Karen Chen placed 13th.\n\nRussian figure skater Kamila Valieva was cleared to compete in the short program after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. After a banned heart medication was flagged in a test Valieva took two months ago, the CAS ruled that the 15-year-old Valieva, is a “protected athlete” because of her age, allowing her to compete.\n\n(Looking for updates from Wednesday's events? We've got you covered.)\n\nSkiing in her first-ever Olympic downhill, Mikaela Shiffrin completed her run well off the pace in the event at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nShiffrin posted a time of 1:34.36, over two seconds off the gold medal run by Switzerland's Corinne Suter. The two-time Olympic gold medalist, who skied out in the giant slalom and slalom, is still planning to compete in all five individual disciplines.\n\nTV SCHEDULE: What and how to watch Olympics Monday night and Tuesday morning\n\nTEXT ALERTS: Sign up for behind-the-scenes access from our reporters on the ground\n\nOLYMPICS NEWSLETTER: All of our coverage straight to your inbox\n\nMEDAL COUNT: How each country is performing at the Winter Games\n\nRussia's Kamila Valieva returns to the ice\n\nRussian phenom Kamila Valieva took the ice Tuesday amid international controversy after testing positive for a banned heart medication called trimetazidine. She was provisionally suspended, then reinstated upon appeal, allowing her to compete despite differing opinions between the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nValieva, 15, twisted off-axis on the first of her three jumps – the notorious triple axel – and touched the ice on her descent. But she landed the other two jumps, scoring 82.16.\n\nKaren Chen short program score\n\nBEIJING — Skating first in the final group, American Karen Chen fell on a planned triple loop jump in the second half of her program, grimacing with frustration as she left the ice.\n\nChen's score of 64.11 on Tuesday was slightly lower than her short program score in the team event earlier this month, which was 65.20. She also fell in that program.\n\nChen, 22, went on to skate a redemptive long program as Team USA won silver in the team event.\n\nThe only returning Olympian of the three American women in the field, Chen placed 10th at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nAlysa Liu short program score\n\nBEIJING — Alysa Liu barely stopped smiling Tuesday, from the moment she took the ice for her Olympic debut to the moment she left.\n\nThough she didn't attempt the notoriously difficult triple axel, which has helped distinguish her from her compatriots, Liu turned in a clean, energetic performance in her short program, recording a score of 69.50.\n\nWith only eight skaters left to compete, the California native was sitting in second place behind only Wakaba Higuchi of Japan.\n\nLiu, 16, is not only the youngest member of the U.S. figure skating team, but also the youngest member of Team USA in Beijing, period. A two-time national champion, she was favored to win a third title in January but tested positive for COVID-19 in between the short program and long program, forcing her to withdraw.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nValieva has Moscow fans cheering her\n\nFifteen-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva has seen the support of her country despite being the center of a doping controversy.\n\nBillboards in Moscow have popped up with the message, “Kamila, we are with you!\"\n\n“It is very nice, in such a difficult time, this support is very important to me,” Valieva said, according to a report in the Russian newspaper Pravda. “I thought I would be alone, but my close people will never leave me.”\n\nMariah Bell short program score\n\nBEIJING — Mariah Bell became the oldest American woman in 94 years to compete in Olympic figure skating on Tuesday night, when she took the ice for her short program.\n\nBell, 25, fell on the second part of her triple flip-triple toeloop combination at the beginning of her program but landed her next two jumps to record a score of 65.38, which was good for second place at the time.\n\nBell, who won the most recent national championships, was the first of three American women to take the ice Tuesday. Alysa Liu was set to skate at 8:18 a.m. ET, followed by Karen Chen at 8:46 a.m. ET.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nUS men qualify for aerials final\n\nThe U.S. qualified all three men for the aerials finals on Wednesday.\n\nChris Lillis of Pittsford, N.Y. and Eric Loughran, of Pelham, N.H. both qualified on their first jumps while Justin Schoenefeld of Lawrenceburg, Ind. got through on his second jump.\n\nLoughran was in fourth position after a Back Full-Double Full-Full while Lillis sat in sixth position with a Back Double Full-Full-Full.\n\nSchoenefeld used a higher degree of difficulty Back Double Full-Full-Full on his second jump to get himself in to the medal round.\n\nFour days ago Schoenefeld and Lillis helped the U.S. mixed aerials team win gold for the over the favored Chinese with Ashley Caldwell. Schoenefeld was the first athlete from the state of Indiana to win a gold medal at the Olympic Winter Games.\n\n-- Lori Nickel\n\nWhile you were sleeping\n\nThe U.S. picked up one medal overnight, a bronze in men's team pursuit. Here's what else you missed overnight Tuesday while you were sleeping:\n\nSofia Goggia of Italy wins silver just 23 days after scary crash\n\nBEIJING — After the last three weeks, hurtling down the mountain was the easy part for Sofia Goggia.\n\nThe Italian won the silver medal in the downhill Tuesday, just 23 days after a crash in the super-G race in Cortina left her with a partially torn cruciate ligament in her left knee and a “minor fracture” in her fibula. She didn’t get back on skis until Feb. 4.\n\n“This is why I have so much effort, because I wanted an outcome like this one today,” Goggia said. “Of course sometimes things don't work as you want to, but I really gave everything I could. … This is why I'm really grateful and glad for this medal.\n\n\"I couldn't have done more than this today.\"\n\nGoggia won the downhill gold at the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2018, and was heavily favored before her crash to repeat. She had won all but one of her last nine races, and leads the World Cup standings.\n\nBut the crash left Goggia uncertain if she’d even be able to compete at the Beijing Olympics. She rehabbed relentlessly, ditching her crutches three days after the crash so she wouldn’t lose her fitness, and working in the gym and the pool.\n\nShe arrived in Beijing on Feb. 7. She hoped to do the super-G, but decided after training runs that she wasn’t ready. After the first downhill training run, Goggia said she wasn’t concerned with the result, that just doing the race would be a victory.\n\n“I just said to myself, `I'm here, let's play, let's do everything,’\" she said.\n\nGoggia was in first place when she crossed the finish line. She let out a loud and long scream, then kissed a TV camera. Switzerland’s Corinne Suter, who is second in the downhill standings, bumped her to second, but it couldn’t dampen Goggia’s happiness.\n\nGoggia’s Italy teammate Nadia Delago won the bronze medal.\n\n“It’s still a medal. It’s still a great medal,” Goggia said. “It’s an unbelievable medal because of the condition of the last 20 days.”\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nUS men win bronze medal in team pursuit\n\nIt was no world record for the United States in the men’s speedskating team pursuit, something the Americans accomplished at the world championships in Salt Lake City two months ago.\n\nA bronze medal in Beijing will do, though.\n\nJoey Mantia, 36, paced the team against speedskating legend Sven Kramer (nine Olympic medals, four gold) over the eight laps as the Americans outlasted the Netherlands with a time of 3:38.81. Meanwhile, the Dutch switched leaders on and off throughout the race. For Mantia, a native of Ocala, Florida, it’s the first medal of his career in his third Olympics.\n\nCanada defeated Russia in the A final to win gold.\n\nIn the B final, Mantia replaced Ethan Cepuran, who skated for the U.S. in the semifinal. The decision to not include Mantia in both heats was perplexing to some in the speedskating community, who felt not rolling with him against Russia in the semifinals was a case of the Americans failing to deploy their best lineup. Casey Dawson and Emery Lehman competed in both heats to earn the first medals of their careers as well.\n\nDawson arrived in Beijing later than planned due to a COVID infection weeks before the Olympics. He landed within two days of his first race, except his skates didn’t make it, forcing the 21-year-old to race the 1,500 meters on a borrowed pair. Dawson finished second-to-last (28th), while Mantia came in sixth in the individual event.\n\nIt’s the second U.S. speedskating medal at the Games; Erin Jackson made history by becoming the first Black woman to win an individual gold in the Winter Olympics, winning the women’s 500 meters on Sunday.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nKamila Valieva takes the ice for her short program later Tuesday\n\nBEIJING — The most-anticipated figure skating short program since the 1994 Tonya-Nancy scandal begins Tuesday at 6 p.m. Beijing time (5 a.m. ET).\n\nBut the show really starts at 9:52 p.m. local time (8:52 a.m. ET). That’s when 15-year-old Russian gold-medal favorite Kamila Valieva takes the ice for her two-minute, 40-second short program.\n\nShe was expected to dominate the competition, but that was before she became perhaps the most infamous athlete on earth due to a positive drug test that has rocked these Games.\n\nNow the question is: how will Valieva deal with the immense pressure she is under? She shared an emotional moment with her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, after practice Saturday.\n\nWill she steel herself against the onslaught of worldwide athletic condemnation and perform as she did in the team event, when she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in an Olympic figure skating competition?\n\nOr will the pressure get to her? Will she make mistakes or even worse, crumble under the intense glare of the spotlight?\n\nAmerican Karen Chen, who won the silver medal with the U.S. team earlier in these Games, skates right before Valieva in the final group. Mariah Bell is three groups earlier and Alysa Liu is in the second-to-last group.\n\nOne thing is certain: whatever happens, viewership of Valieva’s short program will pale in comparison to the number of people who watched Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan skate their short programs in February 1994. TV ratings for that night of the Olympics on CBS soared to 48.5, meaning almost half the nation watched an event that was tape-delayed, in which everyone already knew the result.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nDisastrous ninth end dooms U.S. women's curling team in round robin loss to Switzerland\n\nBEIJING – The U.S. women’s curling team was on the verge of taking down the unbeaten Swiss team Tuesday and putting itself in prime position to make the medal round.\n\nInstead, after a disastrous ninth end that led to a 9-6 loss to Switzerland, the Americans slipped to 4-3 and will be in a five-way fight for the last two spots as the round robin portion of the competition winds down. They will finish out with head-to-head games against two of those teams in Canada and Japan, which also have three losses.\n\nThe Swiss team has not lost yet at these Olympics, but the U.S. put them under a ton of pressure after scoring two points in the eighth end for a 6-4 lead. Unfortunately for the Americans, they made a mess of the ninth end after the Swiss set up the board with two stones in the house and multiple guards.\n\nBoth vice-skip Nina Roth and skipper Tabitha Peterson had takeout opportunities that would have limited the damage to one or two points, but they just missed their targets, opening the door for Switzerland to put together a big end. Swiss skipper Alina Paetz was easily able to knock the only American stone out of the house with the hammer, instantly flipping a two-point deficit into a two-point lead.\n\nThe U.S. has made the medal round just once since curling was re-instated as an Olympic sport in 1998, losing in the semifinals of the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nAlex Hall goes for a 'scary' option in men's freeski slopestyle and it pays off\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Alex Hall likes to keep an open mind as one of the best freeskiers in the world.\n\nSo when he got to Genting Snow Park in the snowy mountains of the Beijing Winter Olympics, he wanted to try every rail, go on every jump and angle and look at every possibility of the slopestyle course first before deciding on his run.\n\nOn Tuesday, for his first and second qualification runs, Hall then unveiled a new creative angle: he took the middle of the slope on the second jump feature, which he didn’t see from any other skier - or snowboarder for that matter. He looked like he was a skipping stone thrown over water, grazing the slope with two aerial moves on both sides. It was graceful and a move he’s been trying for a couple of days and finally dialed in.\n\n“It’s been really scary to figure out but I am a little more confident on it now,” said Hall. “Still a little scared of it but I figured I’d go for it and hope that it worked out – and it did.”\n\nIn more technical terms, it’s a switch left seven to nose butter, to switch left 5 with a Japan grab. And it helped him earn him a qualifying score for the finals on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m always looking for something creative, something that will bring me joy,” said Hall, who advanced with U.S. teammates Nick Goepper and Colby Stevenson. “If I can do that in competition skiing and a big stage like this, at the Olympics, that’s kind of the cherry on top.\"\n\n“It’s a really free sport, you can express yourself exactly how you want. That’s also my personality; that stuff doesn’t really work out for me when I’m too regimented and too serious about everything.”\n\n– Lori Nickel\n\nChina's Su Yiming wins gold, Team USA misses podium in men's snowboard big air\n\nBEIJING – Su Yiming is well-known throughout China as a child actor, but he’s never put on a better performance than in Tuesday’s snowboard big air finals.\n\nJust 17 years old, Su landed both frontside and backside 1800s – the latter with a triple cork, or three vertical flips – to easily win the gold medal in front of the home crowd.\n\nNorway’s Mons Roisland took the silver medal, while Canada’s Max Parrot snagged the bronze with two good runs after crashing on his first attempt.\n\nAfter the first run, it looked like American Chris Corning might have a shot at a medal when he landed a massive backside quad cork 1800, earning him a score of 92. Corning said he had been struggling in practice with his mental focus and was surprised to be able to land that trick.\n\n“I was like 0-for-3 in X-Games (with that trick) so I was super happy about that,” Corning said. “I put it down about as perfect as I can.”\n\nBut after failing to land a frontside 1440 on his second jump, he tried again on his third. Though Corning executed it well, it didn’t have nearly a high enough degree of difficulty to get on the podium given the level of competition. He ended up in seventh place.\n\nFor American Red Gerard, the slopestyle gold medalist in 2018, big air has never been his favorite event. With some help from his competitors, he was in position to potentially medal after landing a solid triple cork backside 1620 with his third jump. But Gerard didn’t get quite enough help and ended up fifth.\n\n“I was very happy I was able to land two runs,” Gerard said. “Just to be in this final was something crazy, definitely a big day for snowboarding with how many spins that were going on. I just didn’t know what to fully do trick-wise, whether to keep it chill or try to push it and go for a way bigger trick. I ended up keeping it chill and I’m quite happy with it honestly. I don’t know if I was fully ready to go 18 and 19 right now.”\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nKamila Valieva says grandfather's medication to blame for positive drug test\n\nBEIJING — Attorneys for Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva argued that the banned substance trimetazidine entered her system through a medication that her grandfather takes, a member of the International Olympic Committee confirmed Tuesday.\n\nIn a scrum with reporters after the IOC's daily press briefing, a reporter asked IOC member Denis Oswald if the IOC was aware of the explanation that Valieva, 15, offered to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in an appeal hearing earlier this month.\n\n\"I was not in this hearing,\" Oswald said. \"Her argument was this contamination which happened with a product her grandfather was taking.\"\n\nThe crux of Valieva's defense had been previously reported Monday by The Dossier Center, a website run by exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The website said it obtained audio of Valieva's hearing with RUSADA, which it said lasted only 90 minutes.\n\nAccording to The Dossier Center, Valieva's attorney, Anna Kozmenko, argued in the hearing that trimetazidine entered the 15-year-old's body accidentally, through a contaminated product. She also argued in the hearing that the product likely belonged to Valieva's grandfather, who takes trimetazidine for heart issues, according to the website.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nMaggie Voisin remembers late brother following women's slopestyle skiing competition\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Maggie Voisin couldn’t feel her brother’s dogtag move as she slid, flipped and spun her way down the Olympic slopestyle course.\n\nThough it was tucked under many layers as Voisin competed in her third Games, the 23-year-old knew it was there both to remind her of the brother she lost just more than a year ago and of the lessons she’s learned since.\n\nSo the veteran freeskier knew to be grateful even as she finished just outside the podium for a second Olympics. The only American in the final at Genting Snow Park on Tuesday, Voisin finished in fifth.\n\n“That really changes the way you look at life. The fact that I am here at the Olympics getting to do what I love, you’ve got to be grateful and appreciative every day,” she said. “That’s how my brother lived his life.”\n\nMichael Voisin, a second lieutenant in the Army, died by suicide in January 2021. His death devastated Maggie Voisin, sending her into a grieving process that prompted her to take time away from training.\n\nTo come back in the Olympics – to briefly sit in bronze medal position – was something to be grateful for.\n\n“I thought about him every moment, every run,” she said, “and I know that I made him proud.”\n\nSwitzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud, the silver medalist four years ago, won gold, narrowly beating out China’s Eileen Gu for silver. Estonia’s Kelly Sildaru won bronze on her safety run, seeing her ski pop off at the end of her second run that likely would have scored higher.\n\nVoisin was in bronze-medal position after her second run only to get bumped by Gu and Russia’s Anastasia Tatalina.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nFather of US figure skater Alysa Liu says Kamila Valieva decision 'destroys the Olympic spirit'\n\nBEIJING — The father of United States women's figure skating Olympian Alysa Liu is not happy with the decision that allowed Kamila Valieva to continue competing at the Beijing Olympics despite testing positive for a banned substance Dec. 25.\n\n\"She tested positive for a banned drug. What’s not clear about it? She should be out,\" Arthur Liu said, according to the Associated Press. \"That is as simple as that. What kind of message are they sending to millions of young boys and girls in sports — particularly figure skaters? That cheaters are allowed to compete in the Olympics, the holiest competition on the planet. It totally destroys the Olympic spirit.\"\n\nThe figure skating world, and Olympic movement at large, has been ablaze with criticism after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) determined that Valieva could keep competing at these Games.\n\nArthur Liu said he's avoided giving his daughter medicine while sick to avoid a positive test, and was critical of Valieva's controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze. He also expressed regret of having his daughter compete in figure skating.\n\n\"I just simply can't believe the 'irreparable harm' to her,\" he told reporter Kalyn Kahler. \"How about the irreparable harm to other clean athletes? You are depriving them.\"\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHilary Knight's skills, leadership pushing Team USA forward in women's hockey\n\nOn a team filled with stars, U.S. women's hockey forward Hilary Knight is probably the most popular.\n\nShe has the endorsements, including with Visa and Ralph Lauren. She has posted on TikTok daily from Beijing. But U.S. coach Joel Johnson says to not pay attention to that side if Knight. He prefers to focus on who she is behind the scenes – a soft-spoken, quiet, intense leader off the ice.\n\n\"The one that people look to when they’re not sure where to look. The one who people trust in when they’re not sure who to trust,\" Johnson told USA TODAY Sports. \"I think the impact she has on her teammates is so meaningful.\"\n\nKnight already tied the U.S women's hockey record for most Olympic selections with four, and with another medal now assured in Beijing -- Team USA will play archrival Canada for gold -- Knight's hardware count (four) will be also tied for most all time.\n\n\"Consistency kills,\" Knight, who won gold in 2018 and silvers in 2010 and 2014, told USA TODAY Sports before departing for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nAt these Beijing Games, Knight has been a model of \"consistent\" production. She's recorded at least one point in five of six games and leads the team with nine points overall. And if the U.S. wins its second consecutive gold, it will be hard to find someone in USA hockey history whose résumé matches that of Knight.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhy are Olympic skiers in Beijing wearing tape on their faces?\n\nWhile watching the women's downhill, it's hard not to notice the blue tape on the faces of many of the skiers.\n\nAthletes in Beijing are using KT Tape to protect their skin from the freezing cold temperatures, but the CEO of KT Tape Greg Venner warns that the tape isn't clinically tested for faces.\n\nThe KT Tape that athletes are putting on their faces is normally used as an elastic sports tape to provide support for muscles, ligaments and tendons to allow for full range of motion. The tape is sponsored and used by several athletes in the Beijing Winter Olympics as well as the summer Olympics season.\n\nThere's no precedent for using the tape on faces or evidence that it protects people from the cold, and Venner says that athletes should be careful about using the tape on the delicate skin on their face.\n\n“We’ve seen KT Tape used as protection against the wind in winter sports over the years, so although it isn’t a clinically approved usage, we appreciate the ingenuity. KT Tape doesn’t endorse the use of kinesiology tape on the face as it isn’t clinically tested,\" Venner told USA TODAY. \"However, we certainly applaud the creativity – we are proud to support Team USA!”\n\n— Michelle Shen\n\nMikaela Shiffrin gains valuable experience in completing women's downhill\n\nBEIJING — Consider this preparation for the Alpine combined.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin raced the downhill for the first time at an Olympics on Tuesday. She didn't win a medal – she finished in 18th place, 2.49 seconds behind gold medalist Corinne Suter from Switzerland – but it gives her more experience on the course ahead of Thursday’s combined, which features a run each of downhill and slalom.\n\nUnlike her first few races in Beijing, Shiffrin was not expected to get a medal in the downhill.\n\nBut she had hoped to do all five individual races at the Beijing Olympics, something she couldn’t do four years ago after weather-related delays upended the schedule.\n\nExpected to contend for multiple medals in Beijing, Shiffrin has instead had a tough time. The two-time Olympic champion skied off the course five gates into the first run of both the giant slalom and slalom, her two best events, and was ninth in the super-G.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nTeam USA making a push to advance in men's curling with win over Switzerland\n\nBEIJING – It’s come down to crunch time for the U.S. men’s curling team. With three matches to go in round-robin play entering Tuesday and a 3-3 record, winning out would almost surely guarantee a place in the semifinals.\n\nTeam Schuster took care of business in the first of those matches and defeated Switzerland 7-4. The Americans were tied with the Swiss for fourth place; the top four teams advance to the semifinals. The U.S. lost the first end, but battled back to take a 2-1 lead at the end of the second. Clutch shooting in the seventh and ninth ends helped secure the victory.\n\nFor the U.S., friendly scheduling will be a boon. The final two games of the round-robin are against the bottom two teams in the standings, Italy (later Tuesday) and Denmark (Thursday). In other good news, Russia – another team that entered 3-3 and tied for fourth – lost to Norway 12-5. That means the U.S. is currently in sole possession of fourth place to give them some room for error, depending on how the tiebreakers shake out.\n\nA loss to Canada earlier in the tournament dropped Schuster and Co. to 2-3. But like they did four years ago in Pyeongchang, the Americans appear to be capturing momentum when it matters most.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEileen Gu takes silver in slopestyle to go with earlier big air gold\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – That it was expected made it no less remarkable.\n\nEileen Gu claimed her second freeskiing medal during these Beijing Olympics, setting her up for the unprecedented three medals she’s aiming for by the end of the week.\n\nNeeding to put down a big run to get in contention, Gu landed a double cork on her second to last jump, followed by a 900 to get on the podium.\n\nSwitzerland's Mathilde Gremaud took gold and Kelly Sildaru of Estonia won bronze.\n\nGu already claimed gold in big air’s Olympic debut last week.\n\nThe American-born teen is competing for her mother’s native China, a decision that has made her beloved here but also drawn criticism.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nAustria's Anna Gasser makes history in winning big air gold\n\nBEIJING – The first female snowboarder to ever land a cab double 1260 in competition did it again when it mattered most.\n\nAustria’s Anna Gasser, sitting in second place before her final run of the big air competition and needing to pull off a big trick to pass New Zealand’s Zoi Synnott-Sadowski for the lead, didn’t just land the 1260 Tuesday – she absolutely stomped it for a monster score of 95.5. It turned out to be more than enough for Gasser to win her second consecutive gold medal in this event.\n\nAs Gasser landed cleanly at the bottom of the Big Air Shougang, she put her hands to her head, almost in disbelief. Even for someone who has been dominant over the years in this discipline, pulling that off under such immense Olympic pressure was a tremendous feat.\n\nSynnott-Sadowski, who won the gold in slopestyle earlier in these Olympics and also took the big air title at the most recent Winter X-Games, had a shot to one-up Gasser and steal back the title. But her attempt at a double cork 1260 failed as she came in a bit too steep on the landing.\n\nThe way the competition set up, with snowboarders being scored on their two best jumps out of three, paved the way for a big dramatic finish and encouraged the riders to try for huge tricks towards the end.\n\nJapan’s Reira Iwabuchi, who was sitting in fourth place, even tried a triple cork on her final run in an attempt to make the podium. Though she didn’t quite land it, the other snowboarders rushed to congratulate her at the bottom of the hill for the audacious attempt.\n\nAt that point, the only question was how the top three would finish. After Japan’s Kokomo Murase missed on her third run, the path was cleared for Gasser to make one of the most dazzling runs of her legendary career.\n\nAmerican Hailey Langland, who squeaked into the final by a quarter of a point, was not able to land either of her first two tricks. Eliminated from medal contention, she took the safe route down the jump on her third try and settled for 12th place.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nCoaching change helps spur US women in aerials\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – On Monday night the American women qualified three for the finals and two in the superfinals of women’s aerials.\n\n“And that’s a quarter of the field so we all came out here and we put down our best jumps,” said the youngest member of the team, Kaila Kuhn, 18. “We really showed there’s a great future for the U.S. team.\"\n\nIt spoke to the strength of the women’s Team USA and the team in general.\n\n“I think the hard work that we've all put in - in the last few years, and Vladimir Lebedev became our head coach, that was a new shift for me as well,” said bronze medal winner Megan Nick Monday night. “And so that has really helped some of the athletes who have worked with him.\n\n“But all around just having Ashley Caldwell on the triple and being such a great role model for how we can keep pushing our ability and our degree of difficulty has been really beneficial.”\n\nLebedev was born and raised in Uzbekistan, earned a bronze medal at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Torino, and his uncle was president of the Uzbekistan Ski Association.\n\nWhen Lebedev took over in 2019, he immediately set his sights on the new Team Aerials event, which debuted here at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, and which the Americans won. Caldwell was the woman on the mixed team which earned her a gold medal.\n\nNick’s bronze is the first medal for the U.S. women's individual aerials in 24 years; Nikki Stone was the last to medal, at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, with gold.\n\n\"I know that interest in our sport in the U.S. has been dwindling,\" Nick said, \"so I just hope that our gold in the mixed team event and this medal – and hopefully another medal in the coming days – inspires kids around the nation to consider starting aerials.\"\n\n-- Lori Nickel\n\nSkating world offers near-unanimous rebuke of CAS ruling on Russia's Kamila Valieva\n\nShortly after the Court for Arbitration in Sport issued its ruling allowing Russian teenager Kamila Valieva to compete in the women's figure skating competition despite a positive drug test in December, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee issued a strong statement in opposition.\n\n\"We are disappointed by the message this decision sends,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland said. \"It is the collective responsibility of the entire Olympic community to protect the integrity of sport and to hold our athletes, coaches and all involved to the highest of standards.\"\n\nThat rebuke was mild compared to what other skating stars had to say. For example, NBC commentator and former U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir called the decision \"a slap in the face to the Olympic Games, to our sport and to every athlete that has ever competed at the Olympics clean.\"\n\nTeam USA finished second to Valieva and the Russians in the team figure skating competition earlier in the Games. Valieva will be the gold medal favorite when the women's individual competition begins on Tuesday.\n\nTeam USA curling squads in action Tuesday. Let's review the rules.\n\nThe U.S. men's curling team is currently battling Switzerland, which you can watch here or on CNBC. The squad currently holds a 3-3 record after six of 10 round-robin matches.\n\nAs you're watching maybe you're like us, thinking: What was that move for? Why did they do that? And what is with all the sweeping?\n\nWell we've got you covered. Here's a reminder of the rules of curling and more information about the event's schedule at the Winter Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin skis back into action in women's downhill\n\nBEIJING — Looking for a reason to stay up late? Mikaela Shiffrin is racing the Olympic downhill for the first time.\n\nThe downhill begins at 11 a.m. Tuesday Beijing time, so 10 p.m. Monday night on the East Coast. No doubt NBC was pleased with Shiffrin’s decision.\n\nShiffrin didn’t do the downhill at her previous two Olympics. She’d hoped to race it at Pyeongchang in 2018, but weather-related delays disrupted the schedule and she didn’t have enough time to train. Though she hadn’t been on downhill skis since December until the first training run Saturday, Shiffrin has decided to do the race.\n\n“It's going to be intense and a little bit of nerves but in general I think it's going to be really cool to be able to race,” she said. “One of my biggest goals coming here was to start in every event. At least that dream may still be alive.\"\n\nShiffrin is 12th on the start list, just in front of reigning Olympic downhill champion Sofia Goggia. Alix Wilkinson starts 21st and Keely Cashman will go 26th. The final American, Jackie Wiles, will start 30th in the 36-skier field.\n\nIt’s cold at the National Alpine Skiing Centre; the temperate forecast for the start of the race is minus-7 degrees. But it’s clear and sunny with light winds, so good conditions for a downhill race.\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nIs the big air venue in Beijing really located next to a nuclear power plant?\n\nThere’s no great need or demand for permanent venues to host a sport as niche as big air, but the Chinese went ahead and did it anyway. It is a towering, dramatic structure rising above a former industrial park where they used to mill steel, flanked by cooling towers that evoke images of nuclear winters moreso than the Winter Olympics.\n\nAnd yet it might just be the best idea the Chinese have had at these Beijing Games, writes USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken.\n\nBut are those towers really part of a nuclear power plant, as many social media posts have suggested?\n\nA USA TODAY fact check reveals they're actually industrial cooling towers from a now-closed steel mill.\n\nRussian teen skater Kamila Valieva cleared to compete\n\nBEIJING — Kamila Valieva has been cleared to compete at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a momentous decision, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled Monday in favor of the Russian figure skating superstar and the country's anti-doping agency, dismissing the provisional suspension that Valieva, 15, would have otherwise faced after she tested positive for a banned heart medication.\n\nThe CAS panel reasoned that the six-week delay from the time Valieva's sample was collected to the time she was informed of the positive result was \"not her fault\" and noted her special status as a \"protected person\" under world anti-doping rules, because she is not yet 16.\n\n– Tom Schad\n\nUS moves up medal count with four more on Monday\n\nAfter a stellar day for American women, the USA has moved into third place all by itself in total gold medals at the Beijing Olympics with seven.\n\nBobsledders Kaillie Humphries and Elana Meyers Taylor took gold and silver in the monobob, while first-time Olympian Megan Nick won a bronze in women's aerials and the ice dancing team of Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue also won bronze.\n\nTeam USA now has a total of 16 medals, which ranks third in the overall medal count behind Norway's 19 and the Russian Olympic Committee's 18.\n\nThe Norwegians also lead the way with nine golds. Germany is second with eight.\n\nUS women's hockey team to play archrival Canada in gold medal game\n\nThe U.S. women's hockey team is headed to the gold medal game.\n\nHilary Knight had a goal and assist, and Alex Cavallini stopped 25 shots to lead the Americans over Finland 4-1 in the semifinal.\n\nTeam USA will seek its second straight Olympic gold against Canada (11:10 p.m. ET Wednesday). The U.S. and Canada have faced each other in six of the seven Olympic women's hockey finals. Canada has won gold four times.\n\n\"You know, I think it's wonderful hockey. It's the most beautiful rivalry in sports,\" forward Hilary Knight said after scoring a goal and adding an assist in Monday's win. \"It gets the best and the worst out of both of us at the same time. And it's just a wonderful game.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/07/26/olympics-2021-live-updates-day-4-womens-gymanstics-softball-gold/5379736001/", "title": "Tokyo Olympics live updates: Biles withdraws; US team wins silver", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nUpdated July 27, 2021, 10:55 a.m. ET\n\nDay four at the Tokyo Olympics will be headlined by one of the most anticipated events of 2021 — the women’s gymnastics team final.\n\nAfter a not-so impressive qualifying round, Simone Biles left the U.S. women’s gymnastics team after struggling to land a vault after one rotation (see more on that below). Without its superstar, the team could not catch the Russian Olympic Committee, and finished with a silver medal.\n\nAn upset win for Alaskan teen Lydia Jacoby in the women's 100-meter breaststroke provided an early highlight in Tuesday's action. Jacoby edged U.S. teammate Lilly King, the defending champion in the event from the 2016 Games in Rio. King ended up getting bronze, one of three on the day for American swimmers.\n\nAnother upset occurred at the Ariake Tennis Park Centre Court as No. 2 seed and Olympic cauldron lighter Naomi Osaka lost in straight sets to Marketa Vondrousova 6-1, 6-4. Osaka had dominated in the first two round of the Games, but racked up 32 unforced errors in her loss on Tuesday.\n\nThe US softball team lost to Japan in gold medal game. The Americans have come up short again after the 2-0 loss.\n\nMeanwhile, the outdoor events could all face weather implications as tropical storm Nepartak is expected to hit Japan on Tuesday.\n\nLATEST FROM TOKYO: Sign up for our Olympic newsletter to get exclusive insight\n\nOLYMPIC TEXT ALERTS: We'll be your guide to the Games with the inside scoop sent directly to your phone\n\nDAY 3 RECAP: US sweeps gold in skeet shooting; gymnastics gold for Russian men\n\nLIVE Q+A WITH REPORTER RACHEL AXON: Get your women's gymnastics questions answered\n\nBiles explains her withdraw from gymnastics team final\n\nAfter the U.S. women's gymnastics team secured the silver medal, the headline story was Simone Biles' shocking withdraw from the competition after the first rotation.\n\nBiles decided to remove herself from the lineup after an uncharacteristic misstep on vault. She bailed out of an Amanar, one of her more difficult vaults, and instead struggled to land a much simpler (and lower-scoring) skill.\n\n\"After the performance that I did, I didn’t want to go into any of the other events second guessing myself, so I thought it was better if I took a step back and let these girls go out there and do the job and they did just that,\" Biles told reporters. \"I think tonight they get a gold medal from me in fighting cause they never gave up and they just showed the world what they’re capable of.\"\n\nShe told reporters that she was \"struggling with some things,\" and has gone to therapy and taken medication in the past to cope with high stress and pressure situations. She does not have any significant physical injury.\n\nBiles is qualified to compete in the individual finals for all four apparatuses as well as in the individual all-around finals. She will make decisions about those upcoming competitions on a day-by-day basis.\n\n\"I have to put my pride aside,\" she said. \"I have to do what’s right for me and focus on my mental health and not jeopardize my health and well-being.\"\n\n--Emily Adams\n\n56-year-old U.S. equestrian wins medal\n\nSteffen Peters, a 56-year-old equestrian rider, becomes the oldest U.S. Olympic medalist since 1952. U.S. gets silver behind Germany in team dressage. Peters has participated in four Olympic, winning a team bronze medal on two occasions (in 1996 and 2016).\n\nU.S. softball loses to Japan in gold medal game\n\nIt's deja vu for Team USA.\n\nAt the last Olympic softball competition in 2008, the U.S. lost 3–1 in the gold medal match against Japan. Today, they lost to the same opponent in the same game by the same score differential.\n\nJapan’s winning pitcher was 39-year-old Yukiko Ueno, also the victor in the 2008 game.\n\nThe Japanese team kept the U.S. scoreless, winning 2–0 on its home turf. Japan lost 2-1 to the U.S. on Monday in the finale of round robin play but won the game that counted, handing the Americans their first loss of this Olympics.\n\n--Emily Adams, Jeff Metcalfe\n\nU.S. women win silver in gymnastics team final without Biles\n\nTOKYO – The U.S. women needed to be perfect to erase the 0.8 lead Russia had going into floor, and they weren’t.\n\nGrace McCallum went out of bounds on her second tumbling pass. Jordan Chiles did the same and fell on her third pass. Chiles scored an 11.700 on one of her best events.\n\nSunisa Lee, an unexpected anchor on floor with Biles out, landed a mostly clean routine. While her score led the team, they had not done enough to make up the difference.\n\nCombined with Russia’s powerful tumbling, the U.S. women lost ground.\n\nRussia claimed gold with a team score of 169.528, while the Americans took silver with 166.096. Britain took bronze.\n\nThe win gave Russia its first ever gold medal in the sport and ended a streak dating to 2010 of the U.S. women winning every Olympic or world championship title.\n\nWithout Biles, the Americans didn’t have enough to remain atop the Olympic podium.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nTeam USA in second going into final rotation\n\nTOKYO – It will all come down to floor, where the U.S. women have an uphill battle to win a third consecutive Olympic gold.\n\nRussia took a 2.5-point lead into balance beam but counted two falls on the apparatus to lead by 0.8 going into the final event.\n\nViktoriia Listunova salvaged the rotation for Russia and was the only gymnast to score above 13, despite a wobble and a step forward on her dismount.\n\nThe Americans seized the opportunity.\n\nGrace McCallum led off, saving herself from a fall and scoring 13.666. Sunisa Lee cleanly made her connections and scored a 14.133.\n\nJordan Chiles, who had not been slated to compete on beam until Biles went out, looked composed throughout and switched up her dismount to a double pike, which she could stick more easily to score a 13.433.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nU.S. women move on without Biles\n\nTOKYO – With Simone Biles out of the competition, the U.S. women attempted to recover on uneven bars.\n\nGrace McCallum had a few mistakes – hitting her foot on the low bar – to score 13.700. Jordan Chiles, who was not originally slated to compete on the event and came in when Biles left, executed a clean routine and stuck her dismount.\n\nSunisa Lee, a favorite for an individual gold medal in the event, floated from one bar to the next seemingly effortlessly. Her routine scored a 15.400 to buoy the Americans after Biles’ sudden withdrawal.\n\n\"Simone has withdrawn from the team final competition due to a medical issue,\" USA Gymnastics said in a statement. \"She will be assessed daily to determine medical clearance for future competitions.\"\n\nThe Russians, meanwhile, were as consistent on bars as they were in team qualifying, giving them a 2.5-point lead halfway through the competition.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nSimone Biles out of team gymnastics event\n\nTOKYO – Simone Biles pulled out of the Olympic team final on Tuesday, leaving the competition after struggling to land a vault.\n\nUSA Gymnastics spokeswoman Carol Fabrizio confirmed to USA TODAY Sports that Biles would not compete in the remaining events.\n\nBiles left the competition floor moments after she struggled to land a vault that is second nature for her. On the team’s first event, she shockingly bailed on an Amanar – one of her more difficult vaults – and just barely landed a one-and-a-half.\n\nA visibly upset Biles talked with one of her personal coaches, Cecile Landi, and the team doctor, Marcia Faustin. Though she put on her grips to prepare for uneven bars next, she left the competition floor.\n\nWhen she returned, she took off her grips and put on her warm-ups.\n\nIt was unclear why Biles pulled out or if she was injured.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nTeam USA struggles in first rotation, Biles leaves floor with trainer\n\nGrace McCallum stepped out of bounds on her landing. Jordan Chiles stuck her vault, but barely scored higher than Angelina Melnikova – who did a less difficult vault. And, shockingly, Simone Biles – an Olympic and world vault champion – bailed on an Amanar, one of her more difficult vaults, and barely landed a one-a-half. Biles scored a 13.766, the lowest of anyone in this rotation.\n\nAfter the first, Russia leads by more than a point.\n\nPotentially even worse, Biles left the gym with the team’s trainer before the U.S. women rotated to bars.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nSimone Biles to compete second to last in team gymnastics final\n\nTOKYO — For the first time in years, a major international meet won’t end with Simone Biles’ routine.\n\nWith the Olympic team final set for Tuesday evening here, the United States’ qualifying second means a few things for the order of routines. Here’s a look at how the evening will go.\n\nFirst, all the gymnasts’ scores count. In qualifying, teams put up four on each apparatus and count the best three. Not here. Team final is three up, three count. So any mistake will count against the final score.\n\nIn qualifying Sunday, Russia took first, marking the first time since 2010 that the U.S. team finished anywhere other than first in any phase of Olympic or world championship competition.\n\nWith eight teams in the final, two will compete on each apparatus and rotate together. As the top two countries, Russia and the United States will go in Olympic order of events – vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise.\n\nDuring each rotation, the countries will alternate. So on vault, Russia will go first, then the USA, then Russia, and so on. Countries order their gymnasts from lowest to highest expected scores, so the best athlete on each apparatus goes last.\n\nRussia’s position as top qualifier means that its best gymnast – in this case, Angelina Melnikova – will close out the meet on floor.\n\nBiles, the defending Olympic and five-time world champion on floor, will go second to last.\n\n--Rachel Axon\n\nU.S. defeated by Great Britain in men's rugby sevens quarterfinals\n\nThe U.S. was defeated by Great Britain, 26-21, in the quarterfinals of the men's rugby sevens competition at Tokyo Stadium.\n\nThe U.S. had built a 21-point lead in the first half only to allow Great Britain to score 26 unanswered points for the win to advance to Wednesday's semifinals.\n\nThe tournament is not over yet for the U.S., which will play Canada in a placing game on Wednesday. The men's semifinal, bronze- and gold-medal games also all take place Wednesday.\n\nThe women's rugby sevens competition will kick off Thursday, with the U.S. opening against China at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\n-- Jim Reineking\n\nTokyo has record number of new COVID cases\n\nTokyo reported a record number of new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, four days after the opening ceremony at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe 2,848 new cases announced by government officials Tuesday eclipsed the previous record of 2,520 cases, reported on Jan. 7. Tokyo is under a state of emergency for the remainder of the Games.\n\nOlympic organizers, meanwhile, announced seven new cases among their stakeholders Tuesday -- including four residents of the Olympic Village and two athletes. None of the positive cases included Americans, according to a separate announcement by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\n-- Tom Schad\n\nCarissa Moore wins gold medal in surfing's Olympic debut\n\nCHIBA, Japan – American Carissa Moore, the top-ranked women’s surfer in the world, found a new way to validate her spot at the apex of the sport.\n\nShe won an Olympic gold medal – the first for women's surfing.\n\nWith the sport making its Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, Moore defeated Bianca Buitendag of South Africa on Tuesday in the gold medal match at Tsurigasaki Surfing Beach.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nU.S. women's basketball team defeats Nigeria in Olympic opener\n\nTOKYO — For the first time in a long time, the U.S. women’s basketball team came to the Olympics dogged by some doubts.\n\nNot about whether it would fall short of a gold medal, which is still in the realm of believe-it-when-you-see-it. But the stress level it might take to get there is an open discussion for Team USA, which has six first-time Olympians, relies heavily on a 40-year-old and a 39-year-old and didn’t exactly look primed for a historically dominant run during its training camp in Las Vegas.\n\nBased on Tuesday’s 81-72 win over Nigeria in its Olympic opener, those questions are still valid.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nU.S. shooting team wins fourth Olympic medal\n\nTOKYO — The U.S. shooting team is having a standout performance at the Olympics.\n\nWilliam Shaner got things started at the Asaka Shooting Range when he won gold in the 10-meter air rifle on Sunday. Shaner’s 251.6 broke an Olympic record.\n\nThe record-breaking gold medal shooting performances didn’t stop there.\n\nA day later, Amber English and Vincent Hancock won gold in the women and men’s skeet shooting.\n\nEnglish set an Olympic record with 56 hits. Hancock, who is good friends with English, won gold on the same day, setting a men’s Olympic record with 59 hits.\n\nThree golds and three Olympic records in the matter of two days. No pressure for Mary Tucker and Lucas Kozeniesky who proceeded the three in the 10-meter air rifle mixed team competition on Tuesday.\n\nTucker and Kozeniesky qualified for the gold match after two stages of competition, finishing the series with a score of 418.0. The American duo only trailed China’s Qian Yang and Haoran Yang, who had a total of 419.7, heading into the gold-medal match.\n\nIn the battle for gold, the Chinese shooters were incredibly accurate. The pair didn’t have a single individual shot score below a 9.8. The Chinese team’s accuracy through the rounds was too much for the Americans to overcome, as they defeated the American duo 17-13 to win the gold medal.\n\nTucker and Kozeniesky were awarded the silver to give U.S. shooting four overall Olympic medals.\n\n“U.S. shooting is improving in all of our aspects and we are becoming a better team,” Tucker said. “We’re winning medals together. I hope this keeps getting people interested in the sport. There isn’t a lot of interest in shooting in the U.S. Hopefully us bringing our medal count to four, and we still got a week to go – hopefully that will help.”\n\n-- Tyler Dragon\n\nU.S. wins first medal in women’s synchronized 10-meter platform\n\nTOKYO — The American diving duo of Delaney Schnell and Jessica Parratto took silver in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform on Tuesday, marking the first time the U.S. has medaled in the Olympic event.\n\nSchnell, 22, and Parratto, 27, finished with 310.80 total points, which was 52.98 points behind first-place China and 11.1 points ahead of third-place Mexico. Since the event was introduced at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, China has taken gold at each subsequent Summer Games.\n\n-- Olivia Reiner\n\nCaroline Marks unable to secure bronze in surfing\n\nCHIBA, Japan — American Caroline Marks, at 19 the youngest qualifier in the women's Olympic surfing competition, missed out on a chance to win a bronze medal Tuesday.\n\nMarks, a native of Florida, lost to Amuro Tsuzuki of Japan at Tsurigasaki Surfing Beach in the bronze medal match.\n\nEarlier in the day, Marks won her quarterfinals heat against Brisa Hennessy of Costa Rica. She then lost to Bianca Buitendag of South Africa, relegating her to the bronze-medal matchup.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nCanada wins its first-ever Olympic medal in softball\n\nCanada defeated Mexico, 3-2, in the bronze-medal game in softball to capture the country's first-ever Olympic medal in the sport.\n\nCanada opened the scoring in the second inning on a two-out, two-run single by Emma Entzminger. After Mexico tied the game in the top of the fifth inning, Canada got the winning run in the bottom half of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Kelsey Harshman that scored Janet Leung.\n\nThe United States will face Japan in the gold-medal game Tuesday at 7 a.m. ET (on NBC Sports Network). In 2008, the last time softball was competed at the Olympics, Japan defeated the U.S. in the gold-medal game. Before that setback, the U.S. had won three straight gold medals dating back to the sport's Olympics debut in 1996.\n\n-- Jim Reineking\n\nNaomi Osaka stunned in third round by Marketa Vondrousova\n\nTOKYO – Two things seemed clear through the first two days of Naomi Osaka’s quest to win an Olympic gold medal. The first was how much it meant to her to be representing Japan, which bestowed her the honor of lighting the Olympic flame at the Opening Ceremony. The second was that her tennis seemed up to the occasion.\n\nBut that’s the amazing thing about sports. Everything we think we know can change in the blink of an eye.\n\nJust like that, Osaka’s run is over after a shocking 6-1, 6-4 loss to Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic, continuing the trend of high seeds bowing out early in the women’s singles draw.\n\nBased on nearly every factor imaginable, it would have been hard to see this coming. Vondrousova, a 22-year old lefty, surprisingly made the French Open final in 2019 but has just one WTA title to her name. Her form lately has been inconsistent at best, having fallen to No. 42 after a stint in the top 20.\n\nThis was Osaka’s first tournament since withdrawing from the French Open, citing the need to take a break for her mental health. Her focus now will turn to defending her U.S. Open title later this summer, but in many ways, her entire year had been built around trying to win a gold medal in Tokyo.\n\nNow that dream is gone, opening up the field reminiscent of the 2016 Olympics when longshot Monica Puig took gold.\n\n-- Dan Wolken\n\nAmerican surfer Carissa Moore to go for gold\n\nAmerican surfer Carissa Moore will compete for an Olympic gold medal Tuesday after winning her semifinals heat.\n\nMoore, a four-time world champion, defeated Amuro Tsuzuki of Japan by a thin margin.\n\nShe will face South Africa’s Bianca Buitendag, who defeated American Caroline Marks in the other semifinals heat.\n\nThe top-ranked women’s surfer in the world, Moore, 28, entered the competition as the favorite.\n\nEarlier in the day, she won her quarterfinals heat against Silvana Lima of Brazil.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nAmerican surfer Caroline Marks to vie for bronze\n\nAmerican surfer Caroline Marks will compete for an Olympic bronze medal Tuesday after coming up short in her semifinals heat.\n\nMarks, 19, lost to Bianca Buitendag of South Africa at Tsurigasaki Surfing Beach.\n\nMarks, a native of Florida, will face the loser of the semifinals heat between fellow American Carissa Moore, a four-time world champion, and Amuro Tsuzuki of Japan.\n\nEarlier in the day, Marks won her quarterfinals heat against Brisa Hennessy of Costa Rica.\n\n-- Josh Peter\n\nSURFING AT THE OLYMPICS: Everything you need to know about new Olympic sport\n\nAlaska's Lydia Jacoby wins women's 100 breaststroke, teammate Lilly King gets bronze\n\nTOKYO – Alaskan teen Lydia Jacoby pulled off the upset in the women’s 100-meter breaststroke, becoming the first American woman to win gold in swimming in these Olympics.\n\nShe beat U.S. teammate Lilly King, who was chasing her second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the breast.\n\nJacoby won in 1:04.95 followed by Tatjana Schoenmaker from South Africa and King, who took bronze.\n\nKing, 24, brashly predicted at last month’s U.S. Olympic trials that American women could win every individual race at these Olympics.\n\nShe also famously called out Russia’s twice-suspended Yulia Efimova, slapping the water in celebration after defeating her in Rio in 2016.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nU.S. to play Great Britain in men's rugby quarterfinals\n\nThe U.S. men's rugby team fell to South Africa 17-12 to finish second in Pool C after posting a 2-1 record in round-robin play.\n\nThe U.S. will play Great Britain in the quarterfinals Tuesday at 5 a.m. ET (on NBC Sports Network). Great Britain won silver in the 2016 Olympics, which marked the return of rugby sevens to the Olympic docket after 92 years.\n\nThe other quarterfinal matches are New Zealand-Canada (4:30 a.m. ET), South Africa-Argentina (5:30 a.m. ET) and Fiji-Australia (6 a.m. ET).\n\nFiji are the reigning gold medal winners.

You can't play the same way you always play, but it's part of beach volleyball. We're used to it.\" Baquerizo McMillan said.\n\nBut the Spaniards' preparation for the poor weather did not meet their match.\n\nThe Americans took the first set 21-13 on a statement ace by Ross, just as the rain was starting to pick up. The drizzle continued through the second set, but the U.S. pair finished off the game with a 21-16 set.\n\nNext up, Ross and Klineman will face Sanne Keizer and Madeleine Meppelink of the Netherlands on Friday.\n\n-- Alex Ptachick\n\nUS track coach gets lifetime ban for sexual, emotional misconduct\n\nTOKYO – Track coach Alberto Salazar has been permanently banned by the U.S. Center for SafeSport for sexual and emotional misconduct.\n\nSalazar has 10 days to appeal the decision, which was handed down Monday. The SafeSport center does not reveal details of investigations.\n\nIn 2019, a handful of runners, including Mary Cain, Kara Goucher and Amy Yoder Begley, revealed that they had been emotionally and physically abused while working with Salazar as part of the Nike Oregon Project team.\n\nIn January 2020, SafeSport temporarily banned Salazar. The decision Monday makes it a permanent ban, pending any appeal.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nAwesome images of teen's title-winning performance\n\nAt the age of 13, Momiji Nishiya made history on Monday as Japan’s youngest Olympic champion when she won the gold medal in the women's street skateboard competition.\n\nNishiya edged another 13-year-old, Rayssa Leal from Brazil, at the Ariake Urban Sports Park. USA TODAY Sports looks back on this historic performance with seven memorable photos of Nishiya's successful quest for gold.\n\nBermuda smallest country to ever win gold after triathlon win\n\nFlora Duffy made history by winning gold in the women's triathlon Tuesday as she made Bermuda the least-populated nation to ever win an Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe win also made Duffy the first person from Bermuda to win a medal of any kind at the Olympics since Clarence Hill in 1976. Bermuda has an estimated population of 63,903, according to World Bank. For reference, the entire population would be able to fit inside the 65,000 seat Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\n\nDuffy broke the record held by Liechtenstein, who won gold in the 1980 Winter Olympics in alpine skiing.\n\nDuffy held on to the victory with a time of 1:55:36. She beat out silver medalist Georgia Taylor-Brown of Great Britain, who finished with 1:56:50. Katie Zaferes of the U.S. won bronze with a time of 1:57:03.\n\nGrace McCallum replaces Jordan Chiles in U.S. women's gymnastics lineup\n\nThis is the Olympics of the unexpected, and that includes the U.S. women’s gymnastics lineup for Tuesday's team final.\n\nGrace McCallum will compete on uneven bars and balance beam rather than Jordan Chiles, despite Chiles scoring higher on both events all year. The surprise move follows Chiles’ struggles in qualifying, as the Americans finished second for the first time since the 2010 world championships.\n\nMcCallum and Simone Biles will compete on all four events while Chiles will do vault and floor exercise and Suni Lee will do uneven bars and balance beam. Teams must count all three scores on each event, meaning the choice of McCallum over Chiles is not insignificant.\n\nChiles had been the most dependable of the U.S. women this year, not counting a single fall in her first four meets. That’s 32 events, for those keeping track. She outscored McCallum on both bars and beam at the U.S. Classic in May, Day 1 of the U.S. championship and both days of Olympic trials.\n\nBut Chiles had a rough day in qualifying, falling twice on beam and dragging her feet across the mat during uneven bars. The Americans dropped her score on each of those events.\n\nThe lineup decision will put additional scrutiny on national team coordinator Tom Forster, who initially said the selection committee would use scoring potential to choose the Tokyo team. But he went in rank order instead, selecting McCallum over Skinner despite Skinner giving the U.S. a higher-scoring team.\n\nAsked to explain his reasoning, Forster said the gold medal wasn’t going to be decided by tenths of a point.\n\n\"Our athletes are so strong that I don’t think it’s going to come down to tenths of a point,\" he said last month. \"We didn’t feel like it was worth changing the integrity of the process simply for a couple of tenths.\"\n\n-- Nancy Armour\n\nSurfing finals condensed thanks to typhoon forecast\n\nThe first-ever Olympic surfing competition has faced challenges from Mother Nature throughout the qualifying rounds, and the finals are now being condensed due to volatile weather and surf conditions.\n\nTokyo organizers made the decision to run both the men's and women's finals back to back on Tuesday morning rather than running one final Tuesday and one Wednesday,\n\nSo far, waves have been few and far between for the Olympians competing in Tsurigasaki, Japan, but an impending typhoon is likely to provide better surf conditions on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Kurt Korte, the official forecaster for the Olympic surfing competition, the storm is expected to stir up waves up to seven feet high, but high wind speeds could lead to overly-choppy waters. The surf is expected to die down by Wednesday in Japan, so the surfing competition is taking advantage of the small but promising window to give athletes a competitive final.\n\n-- Emily Adams", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/02/05/the-olympics-are-here-which-athletes-will-usa-today-be-watching-the-excerpt/88525591007/", "title": "The Olympics are here!

Team USA is on the hunt for gold as figure skater Ilia Malinin, who some have dubbed the quad god, pushes the sport of ice skating to dizzying heights.\n\nHello and welcome to USA TODAY's The Excerpt. I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Thursday, February 5th, 2026. Joining me now to discuss one of America's favorite events, ice skating, and what else to watch out for at Milan Cortina 2026 is USA TODAY National Sports Columnist Christine Brennan and Olympic Gold Medalist Brian Boitano, the host of USA TODAY's Milan Magic Olympics podcast. Christine and Brian, it is so wonderful to have you here on The Excerpt. Thanks for joining me.\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nThank you so much for having us.\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nThanks. Yeah, you know what? We're getting a little sick of each other, just the two of us, so it's good to have you join.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nChristine, of course, anything can happen at the Olympics, but Team USA is stacked. Who are the mega stars we'll be watching?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nYou certainly mentioned one right off the bat. Ilia Malinin who is the quad god, as you said, he is two-time world champ, four-time US national champ. He is the prohibitive favorite to win the men's gold medal early in the Olympics, the first week. So in fact, the team competition is beginning on the same day as the opening ceremony. So you'll see Ilia probably quite early in the Olympics. But as Brian knows well, the winter sports by design are ice and snow. And that means that they can be very slippery. It's not like someone swimming in a pool. And yes, something can go wrong for Katie Ledecki, but the odds are it's not going to be the elements. And yet with ice, with snow, that skating is a slippery sport. Ilia Malinin, we're going to be keeping an eye on Amber Glenn, the three-time US Women's Champ, and also Alyssa Liu, the defending world champion on the women's side.\n\nAnd then of course, there are the other sports, including skiing, two huge names, Michaela Schiffrin and Lindsay Vonn. So this is a stacked, power packed US Olympic team.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nBrian, let's go in depth on the US skaters. Who are the favorites?\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nWhere do I start? Well, Ilia Malinin, this guy has set the technical bar so high, higher than ever in the history of our sport. He is just phenomenal. But taking that into effect, nothing is for sure. He has some contenders that if he doesn't have a great night, that they'll be able to come in and steal his thunder, but nobody's expecting that. But just having that amount of pressure, imagine going in and wanting to win a gold medal, but at the same time having expectation from everyone that it's a shoe-in. That's a hard, hard amount of pressure to skate under. So he has his country, he has the quad god title. He's set the bar higher than ever. He's literally probably the most favorite for an Olympic gold medal that we've ever had. And that's a lot of pressure. So I like to give him a chance to take a little bit of the pressure off.\n\nSo nothing's a given for sure, but he is certainly the most dominant. And then the women, we have three really strong women, Alyssa Liu, Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito. We could really have a sweep of the podium. I don't think it is the most likely chance, but that's how talented our women's team is, is that if there are mistakes by some of the Japanese team and other people who are competitive with them, we could have a sweep of the podium.\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nBrian, I agree with you on that. And women skating, obviously men's skating is a very big deal, especially in 1988 when a certain guy won the Olympic gold medal in the Battle of the Brian's. And that was my first Olympics, winner Olympics I covered. And men's skating, certainly. I mean, with Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano, and there have been others most recently, Nathan Chen winning the gold four years ago, and then will Ilia be the one this time? But the women, that's right, that's Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill. And so many of those great names that are iconic cultural names in our country and in the world, not just sports superstars. And the question is, to Brian's point, will there be an American woman who will rise up, or two, or three because it has been 20 years since a US woman has won an Olympic medal.\n\nSasha Cohen, silver medal, 2006 in Torino, just a few hundred miles from where the Milan Olympics will be. That's a long drought for a country that has just produced gold medalists, silver medalists, Michelle Quon, Tara Lapinski, you name it. And that's the real question and they know it. Amber Glenn told us right away, she said, \"We understand there's this drought and we are going to end the drought.\" One of those three American women, maybe two, maybe three, they're the ones that can do it.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAnd of course, the games showcase athletic excellence from across the globe. Brian, who are a few of the international Olympians to watch out for?\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nFor the first time in years, we have two of the... They're not Russians. They're representing a neutral country in the men's event and the women's event. And they are touted to give a challenge to our American skaters, not so much Ilia, but in the women's event, Patrushian is touted to give our women a run for their money. There is a talented cast of skaters. For Ilia Malinin, we have Yuma Kagayama from Japan, who is just an incredible... He's probably the generation after Ilia. And we have our American guys that are doing so well. Andrew Torgeshev and Max Namoff, of course, who is well known for a tragic reason because his parents were on flight 5342 in Washington, that tragedy. But the phoenix rising from the ashes is Max being able to make the Olympic team, which was a little bit of a surprise, but he's always had the talent, but he really put it all together to make the Olympic team. And everybody's hearts are going to be with Max as soon as he steps on the ice.\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nAnd I'll mention also ice dance because we'd love to talk about bears, but the US pairs last won an Olympic medal in 1988 when Brian won his gold medal. That was the bronze medal. And it's nothing against the pears. They're trying hard, but the US has just not been able to really put together a strong pair team for a long, long time to be on the Olympic stage. A couple world medals and certainly national champs. But ice dance is another story entirely. As Brian knows well, there are five now, last five Olympics there have been medals won by the Americans in ice dance, in part because of the scoring system change. It has made ice dance in particular fairer, and none of the nonsense, or at least less of the nonsense of the judges cheating. And so that has opened up the opportunities for Americans.\n\nAnd as of course, Brian knows well, Madison Chalk, Evan Bates, seven time national champions are going to try to finally win their first individual in the sense of ice dance medal. They are the gold medalists in the team competition. They finally got that medal two and a half years after the last Olympics in Beijing. So they are gold medalists, but in the team, they would love to win the gold obviously in the individual ice dance, but there's some tough teams, a French team. The Canadians are good. We'll see how it all plays out, but watch ice dance as well, especially wonderful, great leaders and just terrific veteran skaters, Madison Chalk and Evan Bates.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nChristine, we all love a Cinderella story. Which Olympians on the US roster do you think could surprise the world?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nWow. Well, I'll tell you, in figure skating, since we're talking a lot of skating, and why not? Because it is so popular and Americans love it. Brian mentioned her, Isabeau Levito. She is only 18, so she's the youngest of the three. Amber Glenn's 26 and Alyssa Lu's 20. So Isabeau Levita, one-time national champ. So she's been there. She's been at the top. But to me, she looks like she's the ballerina and the jewelry box. It's Audrey Hepburn out there. Just that classic, beautiful look. Could she slide in the way Sarah Hughes did back in 2002 in Salt Lake City where the other skaters, the top ranked ones didn't do as well, made some mistakes, and all of a sudden Sarah Hughes won the Olympic gold medal, deservedly so.\n\nIsabeau Levito, could she have that couple days of competition? I think that's certainly worth watching. And then these Japanese women skaters that Brian referred to, they're good. They're really, really good. And Japan, Russia, and South Korea have dominated the metal podium in women's skating since, again, since the days of Syracuse, Michelle Quon, Tara Lapinski, Sasha Cohen.\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nAnd that's what makes it so... Figure skating is so dramatic. You never know. I mean, Christine knows when you go into the building that night, sometimes the energy is there and it's so different. Sometimes it's often you're like, the energy's off in this building. Then how the entire night unfolds, sometimes it's one surprise after another. Sometimes it's not great skating. Sometimes it's fantastic skating. You never know what to expect when you go in the building. And so that's why when we say someone can slip in there, it can be someone that you never even counted on coming in, having a fantastic night and placing right up there on the podium. So that's what's so exciting.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo Brian, if you were to highlight just one, is there an athlete story this year that's compelling to you, perhaps something that goes beyond meddling?\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nYeah. I have to say, and I'm directly related to it. So Alyssa Liu, who is world champion from last year, US champion from last year as well, she is the youngest ever to be national champion in our country. And then she retired and came back to skating in full force, and won the world title out of the blue last year, a total surprise to everyone. But she's come with a renewed passion. She decided she wanted to come back with this joie de vivre. She's not going to feel pressure. She's going to have fun. She's going to be a great teammate, and inspire and encourage her other teammates. And she just has this lightheartedness. When you watch her, you smile. She doesn't care about medals. She doesn't care about placement. She cares about that she loves the sport again, and she's doing really well because of it.\n\nAnd because she doesn't feel this pressure and because she doesn't care so much, she has so much less pressure on herself, because most of the people in the events are like, \"I really want to get a medal and I'm nervous.\" And she's like, \"I'm just going to go out there and have fun.\" So she has all this energy and she has all this love. And when she skates so well, the audience gets totally behind her. She is the energy of the future. And she is starting this sisterhood with the other two teammates that is literally capturing the nation by storm. And we're going to see a lot more of that when we watch the Olympics.\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nAnd Dana, Brian has a bird's eye view, as he said, because he's skating with her a couple of times a week. So Brian Boitano is literally on the ice with Alyssa Liu. And Brian, you mentioned something that I actually captured because I was sitting in press row at the nationals a few weeks ago, the US Championships in St. Louis. So this is remarkable. Our country right now, we got people at each other's throats. We've got a lot of controversy out there. We're talking sports here, obviously, right now. And you just refer to it. The cultural significance of Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito, and Alyssa Liu, the three of them, and they finished each other's sentences. They laugh at each other's jokes. They're just great pals. They're always hugging each other. You don't see that all the time at all. In any sport, a competitive sport, which of course skating is, and what I witnessed was amazing.\n\nSo Alyssa Liu is the second to last skater in the long program, the final night of competition for the women a few weeks ago, the US Nationals. She's in first place. There's one skater left. That's the only skater who can beat her. It's Amber Glenn. Now, a lot of times skaters will leave the ice, go back behind the curtains, not want to watch. It makes sense. You're sweating, you're huffing and puffing and you just want to get away from it. You're not going to watch the last person. No. Alyssa Liu just literally crouches down right in front of us on the press row, right at the ice. And she's there cheering for Amber Glenn, the woman who can beat her. And sure enough, Amber Glenn did beat Alyssa Liu. I've covered sports a long time, lots of sports, football, golf, you name it. That's one of those stories you go, \"Wow, I cannot believe I'm just watching this.\"\n\nAnd that's Brian, the woman that you know so well.\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nYeah.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nBrian, you uniquely understand the immense pressure athletes from around the globe are feeling right at this moment. What does the mental preparation look like and feel like for the athletes we'll be watching?\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nWell, I've explained it to Christine before that it's like the layers of an onion. We, from childhood, getting used to different layers of pressure, and expectation, and all these layers of onion keep building on top of you, on top of you, on top of you. And you know what the pressure's going to be like. You know what it's like to defend a national title, which is one level of pressure. You know what it's like to defend a world title, which is another level of pressure. Well, the level of pressure when you get into an Olympics and there's a possibility that you can win a gold medal is times seven. So all these athletes have prepared for this. They have done their mental exercises. They have done as much mental training as they have done triple lutz's. And that's the most important part, is having that at your availability whenever you need it.\n\nIt's your toolbox of things that you will use right when the competition starts. Because when things go down on the ice during competition, it unravels really quickly. And it can unravel in a good way and it can unravel in a bad way. So the tools that you have in your toolbox that you deal with pressure are literally 97% of your work, and the 97% of the most important things that you can have going into the Olympics when there's that pressure involved.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI'll never look at an onion the same way again. Christine, can you share with us something about the backdrop, the venues, the Italian winter scape that I'll be watching on my screen and the two of you will be experiencing on the ground?\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nThis is a unique setup. For the first time ever, you have at least first time... Well, I think it is the first time ever. I've covered every Olympics, as I said, since Calgary in 1988, where I met Brian Boitano, who then of course won the incredible gold medal. But in general, Calgary, the skiing, which I covered some of that, was a half hour drive and you'd go in back and forth, maybe 45 minutes if you were in traffic. Vancouver, 2010, hour and a half on the media shuttle to Whistler, and then you come back and you're back in time for dinner. Well, this is different. This is six, seven, eight hour drive away. So Cortina is absolutely gorgeous. This is going to look terrific on your TV set. It's going to look terrific as you look at the incredible photos being shot by USA TODAY photographers and all of the things that will be part of our stories.\n\nBut Brian and I are going to be in Milan and among many of the other journalists, and we're not going to be able to just, oh, wander over and watch Lindsey Vonn. No, no. And that's different. I actually love it because there's three or four smaller towns, including Cortina, but that they are going to have a big role to play because they're hosting some of the events. But hockey, men's and women's hockey, and let's not forget the US Canada, women's hockey, guaranteed they're going to be playing for the gold medal and that's all they... Either Canada or the US has won all of them. But hockey will be in Milan. The speed skating, Jordan Stolls from Milwaukee, great speed skater, among others, that will also be in Milan. And then of course, figure skating. So that's where the big base of support will be and we're going to be based.\n\nAlthough again, there'll be a lot of different venues with a lot of really cool things going on.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI do want to talk about the podcast, because we have been following your coverage leading up to the games. It's USA TODAY's Milan Magic podcast. What do you have in store for us now that competition is underway?\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nWe're going to talk about everything. We're talking to legends. We're talking to current skaters. We're going to talk judging system, costumes, and that's just the figure skating part. We're going to get into other events as well. I know Lindsay Vaughn will be a big topic and Michaela Shiffrin for us. Jordan Sultz, like you said, in speed skating. Yeah, we're going to be talking about pretty much everything, but we want to surprise you a little bit. We don't want to tell you everything that we have up our sleeves, so keep listening.\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nYeah. And what's fun for me is, so I'm the journalist and Brian's the skater, and we do. We've known each other since '88. So just great friendship and respect. But I think, and I've heard this from people already, we're very honored that people listen and watch, and we already had several, obviously, episodes that we're very proud of. A great team, as you do, Dana at USA TODAY, getting this out to everyone. You can find it wherever you get your podcasts, of course, and on the YouTube channels. But the idea being that we come at things from a different point of view. And if there's news to break, I'm going to be breaking it. And Brian will probably in many cases then comment on that. And his view commenting, Brian, as you are as an athlete, obviously as a personality, as an icon in the sport, I don't think anyone else is giving all of the fans, the thousands, millions of fans that are going to be watching these Olympics that care about it, maybe don't care right now.\n\nAnd here's the opening ceremony. Now you're going to now, oh wow, it's happening the next three or four weeks. Come to us, because I think we figured this out, your first Olympics was 1984, Brian, mine was 1984. Mine was summer, yours winter. So if we just do quick math here, that's 42 years of Olympics for me and 42 years of Olympics for Brian, which if we get a calculator out, we can say that that is 84 years of Olympics\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nA century.\n\nChristine Brennan:\n\nAlmost. Well, a couple more and then we'll add it up. But we're having a ball. We love to have smiles on our faces and tell really positive, happy stories. And if there's stuff that we have to get into that's a little negative, absolutely we will. We will tell you the truth. You're going to get stories here and information that you're not going to get anywhere else, with 84 years, my gosh, of experience on this exact topic over the next three weeks.\n\nBrian Boitano:\n\nChristine and I really dive into it, and we talk about what's important, and we answer people's questions like what are they thinking? So it's really fun and satisfying for us to even be able to talk at depth about everything.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAnd Christine, I hear that USA TODAY has a new book out called Chasing Gold.

In just over two weeks, some of those athletes will compete for the United States in the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"Definitely the perfect storm,” said Brody Malone, a Stanford gymnast who won the men's all-around competition at the Olympic trials June 26 and last Friday signed a deal with EndlessRope, which makes a strength-training device.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2016/06/25/olympics-brazil-travel-/85975616/", "title": "Still time to see Olympic Games, South America style", "text": "Ellen Creager\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nJune 25, 2016, 10:01 p.m. ET\n\nRun, paddle, jump, somersault or swim there.\n\nWith six weeks to go before the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, it still is possible to plan a trip to the games.\n\n\"We do have a few options, but the closer it gets, the less we will have. Everyone interested in going should probably book as soon as possible,\" says Christa Gilbert, agent for Great Atlantic Sports, a sports travel agency in Virginia Beach, Va. It is selling travel packages that include hotel, transfers, breakfast and tickets to some events. One option: a five-night package for about $5,200 per person, not including airfare.\n\nThe Summer Olympics are Aug. 7-21, with 10,500 athletes from 204 countries competing in 28 sports. The Paralympics follow Sept. 7-18.\n\nThirty percent of tickets (1.7 million) remain unsold for the games, officials revealed last week as Brazil opened the first of many ticket offices to encourage its recession-plagued citizens to attend the event.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nHere in the U.S., tickets remain available, although the selection is somewhat like scrounging through cluttered shelves after a fire sale.\n\nIt is unknown exactly how many tickets are still earmarked for Americans. Officials of CoSport, the sole authorized Olympics ticket and ticket package seller for the U.S., declined repeated Free Press requests for comment on inventory, availability or advice to last-minute travelers. It also shut down ticket and package sales on its website, www.cosport.com, last week to consolidate its offerings. When it reopened Friday, it offered tickets for gymnastics, handball, volleyball, table tennis, dressage – and men’s basketball bronze medal game for $306.38.\n\nTickets\n\nTickets are also widely available on StubHub, eBay and Craigslist. On eBay, offerings include a closing ceremony ticket for $975 and two badminton tickets for $36. On Craigslist, someone is selling a men's basketball final ticket for $800. On StubHub, you can buy a men's synchronized 10-meter platform diving final ticket for $244.20 or an opening ceremony ticket for $1,550.\n\nThe Team USA website (www.teamusa.org), the official Olympics athlete site, warns buyers to \"beware of unauthorized companies, individuals and websites that may offer opportunities to secure Rio 2016 tickets.\" Still, many travelers are sure to buy them.\n\nAnd in past Olympics, visitors have found that once they get to the games, it is possible to buy tickets on the street — not the safest method, but common.\n\nAirfare\n\nFlights to Rio de Janeiro from the U.S. for Aug 7 through Aug. 21 still are available. From the U.S., the flight takes anywhere from 10 to 16 hours. The only nonstops fly from New York, Atlanta, Houston and Miami.\n\nFares between Detroit and Rio late last week were at least $1,900 for a one-stop and $1,320 for a two-stop flight.\n\n\"With airfares approaching $2,000, that may be the deciding factor for some people\" about whether to go or not, says Anbritt Stengele, president of SportsTraveler, a Chicago-based sports travel agency.\n\nStill, late bookers as well as friends and family members of Olympic athletes (many athletes don't find out until this month whether they have made the team) will be stuck paying high fares.\n\nLodging\n\nThis is tricky because the games are spread over four \"zones\" in Rio that are somewhat distant from one another.\n\nThe official CoSport site still has hotel rooms near competition sites for $500 and up per night. One choice: the Rio Othon Palace, which is $2,226 per person for a three-night stay, based on double occupancy (in other words, the room is about $1,400 a night.)\n\nAirbnb.com also still shows some availability (300-plus available rentals) for entire apartments in Rio during the games for an average of about $365 per night between Aug. 7-21. Airbnb is an official partner of the Rio Olympics. Expedia shows a few three-star hotels in the Copacabana neighborhood still available, with prices about $235-$400 per night. SportsTraveler.net has Rio apartments for rent near venues but requires a minimum 18-night stay. It also still has a stock of some hotel rooms.\n\n\"We took our packages down about three weeks ago because of limited availability. Now that people have gotten their tickets, everything is falling into place,\" Stengele says. This is Stengele's eighth Olympics owning a sports travel agency, and she advises travelers to be wary about booking a three-star hotel room in Rio — it will not equal the standard of a three-star hotel back home. Also, unless you speak Portuguese, think twice about renting an apartment with no English-speaking front desk.\n\n\"Cab drivers and service people won't speak English,\" she says. \"I would be very careful on apartment rentals, unless you are very familiar with the country.\"\n\nTouring\n\nDon't go all the way to Brazil without seeing some of the iconic sights. You can book sightseeing ahead of time for Rio area attractions like Christ the Redeemer, or build in extra vacation time to visit the Amazon or Icuaçu Falls. You'll be in South America. Why not stay awhile?\n\nPackages\n\nCoSport (www.cosport.com, 877-457-4647) is the official designated ticket and package seller. It still has packages that include tickets, lodging and transfers. One example: “Flex Martinique” package Aug. 13-18, five nights with 6 events, including hotel, transportation and breakfast (not airfare) for $11,327.\n\nGreat Atlantic Sports (www.greatatlanticsports.com, 800-888-8233) has a variety of packages for the games. One example: A 5-night travel package Aug. 4-9 is $5,188 for one person and includes a three-star hotel, transfers, breakfast and tickets to three standard and one premium event (airfare not included).\n\nSportsTraveler (www.sportstraveler.net, 888-654-7755) is still booking hotel rooms, apartments and pre- and post-Olympic sightseeing tours. One example: a day trip to Corcovado Mountain, Christ the Redeemer Statue and Tijuca Rain Forest.\n\nFandeavor (www.fandeavor.com, 888-751-1960) has by far the best information on the neighborhoods where the Olympic events will be and their pros and cons. You can plan a custom trip, depending on the events and your dates.\n\nBlack Tomato (www.blacktomato.com) is offering a super luxury travel last-minute trip to the Olympics, starting at $34,000 per person.

Scaroni was just weeks removed from winning gold and bronze medals at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nThe accident left her with three fractured vertebrae, including an eighth thoracic vertebra (T8) vertebral burst fracture, burns on her arms and legs and a knee injury. It crushed her racing chair, ended her racing year and added to the inevitable questions about her future in the sport.\n\nHer spine surgeon told her that the bones in her back, which were now curved, would never go back to their normal size, and that it would take six months to get back to 80% — and a full year before she would be able to realistically compete again. She would also have to endure not being on her stomach in the racing chair due to her spine.\n\nWhile contemplating her next move, along with cautiously taking advice from her physicians, there was only one thing on Scaroni’s mind: train even harder. Get back out on a course and continue to dominate the competition.\n\nWas there a hint of giving up and leaving racing behind?\n\n“Not a chance,” Scaroni said. “I had to start using common sense to see what I could do.”\n\nThough Scaroni, who will be one of an estimated 50,000-plus participants in the New York City Marathon on Sunday, insists she doesn't have a competitive bone in her body, her perseverance, dedication and willingness to rule her sport at all costs despite having to overcome not one, but two devastating injuries makes her a force to be reckoned with in the racing world.\n\nFuture forester\n\nScaroni’s drive to success came by circumstance.\n\nShe grew up in Tekoa, a small, rural farming community with a population of 800, located on the Palouse of eastern Washington, just a few miles from the Idaho border. Both her parents were foresters, so that naturally took her into having in an interest in the great outdoors.\n\nFamily trips to Priest Lake in northern Idaho to go kayaking and canoeing only strengthened that dream.\n\n“I love being out in the woods and I love trees,” she said. “I think I'm so fascinated by how trees grow and what they do to support each other and also to compete against each other for resources.\"\n\nEverything changed one afternoon in January 1997, when 5-year old Scaroni and her older brother, Jesse, were passengers in a car with her mother, Barbara, driving. Their car hit a patch of ice and careened into oncoming traffic, striking a truck.\n\nThe impact of the crash left her brother with a head injury and her mother suffered a broken ankle.\n\nScaroni suffered the most serious injuries from the accident, severing her thoracic spinal nerve when she was thrust forward by the impact, paralyzing her below the waist. An energetic kindergartener who was just starting to grasp her calling and enjoying activities such as going to the skating rink was told she would need to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life.\n\nAttempting to follow what other children her age were doing took adjustments, being independent and learning the intricacies of being limited.\n\n“If kids were going to tumble down the hill at recess, I had to get back into my wheelchair by myself. I was the only person who used a wheelchair there. I think because of that, there was no way to segregate me to be with the other kids who had disabilities,\" Scaroni said. \"And it's a nice thing to be creative and being young enough that I was just learning how to do life.\"\n\n\"But also, you're going to be surprised, I'm not that competitive.”\n\nScaroni's sister, Rose Antonich, who is nine years older, said she saw an immediate change in Susannah after the accident, including her undeniable determination.\n\n“I think the Lord must have just given it to her,” Antonich said. “And to all of us. We all just rolled with it. Our community just came around us and whatever needed to happen, they were going to make it happen. But there were definitely trials the first few years.\n\n“I think since the last accident, just her resiliency to say, 'I’m just going to get back at this.' I know her faith is the anchor she holds on to. Just knowing this life is temporary, these trials are temporary, and that we have a future in heaven.”\n\n“I was a single mom with four young kids, and we couldn't let that ruin our family life,” added Barbara Scaroni, Susannah's mother whose husband died of brain cancer when Susannah was an infant. “So, yes, they pulled together with my oldest daughter and her two brothers and just tried to do what it took to get back to a normal life and to have the fight.\n\n\"We are not going to let this destroy our lives. That’s where I put the big emphasis. We have so much to be thankful for. Nobody died in this car wreck.”\n\nFinding racing\n\nScaroni's interest in sports came after learning about an adaptive sports program for youth and adults in Spokane, an hour’s drive from her hometown. Her wheelchair racing career started at age 10 with involvement in ParaSport Spokane Team, which gives those with physical disabilities an opportunity to compete against others.\n\nHer mother insisted that Scaroni get involved in sports, so starting in fourth grade, she signed up for wheelchair basketball and immediately became obsessed, parlaying that into joining the racing team, and honing her skills throughout high school.\n\nAfter high school, Scaroni spent two years at Carroll College in Helena, Montana, where she studied chemistry and health science. While there, she got a call from Adam Bleakney, the head coach of the wheelchair track and road racing team at the University of Illinois, who heard about Scaroni from her racing in a local Spokane road race. He had a scholarship available for her to come join the team in 2011.\n\nScaroni quickly evolved as a racer, finishing second in the 2012 Chicago Marathon and posting times good enough to make the Olympic team. She placed eighth in the marathon at the London Olympics and finished one spot higher four years later during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nScaroni says her focus and mindset were the reasons she went from not medaling to making the podium in Tokyo, adding that the programs back home such as ParaSport were key to her development — and for the future of the sport.\n\n\"I was so lucky. The reason I'm here today is because of that adaptive sports team one hour from my house in Washington, but just having a program in Spokane is not enough,\" she said. \"I think there are not enough resources and there's people with disabilities everywhere.\"​​​​​​\n\nFighting back\n\nThe first thing Scaroni had to curb after her four-day hospital stay from the September 2021 accident was her taste for working out.\n\nScaroni usually works out six days a week, taking Sundays off, starting at 5 a.m. She does a session in the morning and weight room training in the afternoon 50 weeks of the year, with a blend of road and track workouts, upwards of 20 hours a week. So it was Scaroni — with some assistance from her mother, who was by her side for a portion of the recovery — who was tasked with keeping herself from overdoing it.\n\nNow Scaroni's trainer, Bleakney — whose athletes have helped build a wheelchair racing powerhouse at Illinois with nearly 60 medals at the Paralympic Games — credits athletes like Scaroni and their desire to win, no matter the obstacles.\n\n“I just have this innate love of exercising,” Scaroni said. “I don't feel happy if I'm just out there cruising along because in a racing chair you could theoretically coast. I don't need others to motivate me. I am so motivated to go as fast as I can on my own. I am so fortunate that my research group and my university have really given me a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to train every morning.”\n\nScaroni was back in her chair after three months, but the training equipment had to be modified to allow her to get workouts in. This included the use of a handcycle a few weeks after the accident.\n\nBleakney also had Scaroni use an upper body ergometer, an indoor bike used primarily for arm training and cardio. A workout bench was raised, attached to a handcycle so that she could lay on her back to use it.\n\n“It's incredibly boring,” Bleakney, a Paralympic silver medalist in the 800 meters at the 2004 Athens Games, says about the ergometer. “She is just staring at the ceiling and would train on this for an hour and a half and just grind away. That alone shows her tenacity, especially if you can handle the boredom of that activity. So, there's no doubt that she would recover and start competing again. There's just a mental fortitude to working through that.”\n\nWith her sights set on a spring comeback, Scaroni’s first attempt at getting back in the fold was derailed by a positive COVID-19 test.\n\nBut the Boston Marathon in April was the start of a dominant run, where she finished second in women’s T53/54 wheelchair division.\n\nScaroni shattered the wheelchair world record in the 10K by more than a minute in June at the B.A.A. in Boston, then won her fourth consecutive Mini 10K in New York City and broke the 5,000-meter world mark at the Daniela Jutzeler Memorial in Nottwil, Switzerland. She went on to have a world-best time at the Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota, and then set the course record at the Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta.\n\nShe placed third at the Berlin Marathon on Sept. 25 and second at the London Marathon on Oct. 2 before winning the Chicago Marathon in 1 hour, 45 minutes, and 48 seconds one week later. There, she beat defending champion Tatyana McFadden, an eight-time Paralympic gold medalist, to cap off an incredible three-week run.\n\nStill, despite the accomplishments — and being among the favorites in New York — Scaroni is humble and puts her life in perspective. She will be competing in her second NYC Marathon, with a field stacked with some of the world's best racers including McFadden, defending champion Madison de Rozario and, four-time winner Manuela Schar.\n\n“Especially after last September and what happened,” she said. “To be honest, I was already really happy about every day. But after that happened, I was like, I actually could have died. Not only do I want to be a role model to others, and sports gives me the biggest platform to do that, but I like to cherish the body I'm in.\n\n\"I try to really enjoy each thing I'm doing throughout the day.\"\n\nThe future\n\nFor now, the 31-year-old Scaroni is balancing her sporting life with an academic one.\n\nShe is completing her master's degree in nutrition science and kinesiology at Illinois, with plans to be a clinical dietitian or using her skills to work with athletes. She says an eating disorder she had in high school led to an understanding that diet and nutrition can make athletes stronger, faster and healthier, and she wants to be a future asset to those with disabilities who have a desire to reach the top. She is also a newlywed, marrying Jacob Jarrett in September.\n\nBut one thing that isn’t on her mind is retirement.\n\nWhen she is not training or reading a volume of the \"Lord of the Rings\" books, she is focusing on her training and her job at the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee as a sports dietitian.\n\n“My biggest legacy that I would like to have is, I really want to have a role in helping people with disabilities get access to sports and to learn how to do them,\" Scaroni said. \"Not everyone is qualified to be a coach and we need to at least make better training for people who want to be coaches.\n\n\"I wake up so grateful I'm alive.\"\n\nFollow Scooby Axson on Twitter at @ScoobAxson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}]}
