It's the third time in recent months -- including during a CNN town hall in October -- that Biden has said the US would protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack, only to have the White House walk back those remarks.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Biden was asked if the US would be willing to go further to help Taiwan in the event of an invasion than it did with Ukraine.\n\n\"You didn't want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?\" a reporter asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Biden replied. \"That's the commitment we made.\"\n\n\"We agree with the One China policy. We signed on to it, and all the attendant agreements made from there, but the idea that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, is (just not) appropriate,\" he said.\n\nUnder the \"One China\" policy, the US acknowledges China's position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing's claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. The US provides Taiwan defensive weapons, but has remained intentionally ambiguous on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden's balancing act amid tensions between mainland China and Taiwan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden's balancing act amid tensions between mainland China and Taiwan 02:41\n\nBiden's strong warning was made right on China's doorstep during his first trip to Asia as President. The visit is aimed at uniting allies and partners to counter China's rising influence. It also came a day before Biden is scheduled to attend the second in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) -- an informal grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India that has alarmed Beijing.\n\nSeveral of Biden's top administration officials were caught off-guard by the remarks, several aides told CNN, adding that they were not expecting Biden to be so unequivocal.\n\nIn a statement following Biden's comments, a White House official said the US' official position remained unchanged.\n\n\"As the President said, our policy has not changed. He reiterated our One China policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself,\" the official said.\n\nChina expresses 'firm opposition' to comments\n\nWithin hours, China had expressed its \"strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition\" to Biden's comments, saying it will not allow any external force to interfere in its \"internal affairs.\"\n\n\"On issues concerning China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for compromise,\" said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"We urged the US side to earnestly follow the One China principle ... be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signal to pro-Taiwan independence and separatist forces — so it won't cause serious damage to the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-US relations.\"\n\nChina's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian added, \"We urge the US to stop saying or doing anything in violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. ... Those who play with fire will certainly burn themselves.\"\n\nTaiwan lies fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) off the coast of China. For more than 70 years the two sides have been governed separately, but that hasn't stopped China's ruling Communist Party from claiming the island as its own — despite having never controlled it.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has said that \"reunification\" between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they've been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island.\n\nJoanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that it \"expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the United States government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.\"\n\nBiden compares potential invasion of Taiwan to Ukraine war\n\nBiden on Monday compared a potential invasion of Taiwan by China to Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, warning, \"It will dislocate the entire region,\" and emphasizing \"Russia has to pay a long-term price for its actions.\"\n\n\"And the reason I bother to say this, not just about Ukraine -- if, in fact, after all (Russian President Vladimir Putin has) done, there's a rapprochement ... between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting, attempting to take Taiwan by force?\"\n\nBiden said that China is \"already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they're undertaking.\"\n\n\"But the United States is committed, we made a commitment, we support the One China policy, we support all we've done in the past, but that does not mean, it does not mean that China has the ability, has the, excuse me, jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan,\" he added.\n\nAt the press conference, Kishida also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\"Attempts to change the status quo by force, like Russia's aggression against Ukraine, should never be tolerated in the Indo-Pacific, above all, in East Asia,\" he said.\n\n\"As the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe, I reaffirmed with President Biden that we need to speedily strengthen the deterrence and response of the Japan-US alliance,\" he said, adding that he conveyed his determination to \"fundamentally strengthen Japan's defense capability.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Ukraine-Russia crisis: As tensions rise on the border, here's what ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations' borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion.\n\nUkraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine -- including increased weapons supplies and military training -- constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank.\n\nThe picture is complicated -- but here's a breakdown of what we know.\n\nWhat's the situation on the border?\n\nThe United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as \"unusual.\"\n\nAs many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine \"as soon as early 2022.\"\n\nSpeaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had \"ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it could double on relatively short order.\"\n\nIn late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware -- including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles -- on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including some 21,000 air and sea personnel, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country.\n\nThe assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution.\n\nUS officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two.\n\nMany of Russia's military bases are to the west of the vast country -- the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia's Defense Ministry has said it is conducting \"regular\" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as \"temporarily occupied territories,\" although Russia denies it.\n\nThe front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists.\n\nRussia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia.\n\nRussian tanks take part in a military drills at Molkino training ground in the Krasnodar region, Russia, on December 14, 2021.\n\nWhat's the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks -- reportedly under pressure from Moscow -- weeks of protests in Kyiv erupted into violence.\n\nThen, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea , an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed \"little green men\" and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol the area surrounding the Ukrainian military unit in Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol, Crimea, on March 20, 2014.\n\nShortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kyiv, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations.\n\nAccording to UN figures , there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014.\n\nThe European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy.\n\nThe Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country's east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement.\n\nUkrainian soldiers prepare to support the withdrawal of troops on February 19, 2015 in Artemivsk, Ukraine.\n\nWhat's Russia's view?\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm.\n\nMoscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO -- in terms of weaponry, training and personnel -- as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.\n\nPutin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a \"red line\" for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. \"And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Analysis: Would Putin get away with invading Ukraine again?

The government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy.\n\nMany people are also unhappy that the government hasn't yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country's east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv.\n\nIn a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to \"calm down\" amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. \"We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,\" he said, before adding that he \"sincerely believes\" this year \"will pass without a war\" with Russia.\n\nKuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. \"No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,\" he said.\n\nPro-Russian fighters arrive on February 20, 2015 in Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine.\n\nWhat does NATO say?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said \"there will be a high price to pay for Russia\" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner.\n\n\"We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,\" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN.\n\nJUST WATCHED Opinion: These maps show why Putin might invade Ukraine Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Opinion: These maps show why Putin might invade Ukraine 03:24\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses \"with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn't have the same security guarantees as NATO members.\n\nBut Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership.\n\nHigh-stakes talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels in mid-January were \"not an easy discussion,\" according to Stoltenberg, who added that \"differences will not be easy to bridge.\" However, NATO allies and Russia \"expressed the need to resume dialogue,\" he said.\n\nWhat does the United States say?\n\nPresident Joe Biden told Zelensky earlier this month in a phone call that the US and its allies \"will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.\"\n\nBut Biden appeared to undermine that message when he subsequently suggested during a White House news conference that a \"minor incursion\" by Russia would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country.\n\nWhile Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. \"There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,\" he said.\n\nHis remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. \"President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,\" press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CNN he was \"shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion\" and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions. \"This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,\" the official added.\n\nThe diplomatic kerfuffle came as Blinken prepared for further talks with European allies on the Ukraine-Russia crisis and to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Blinken has previously warned Russia that \"any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences.\"\n\nTwo defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance.\n\nThe Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. US officials say they are determined not to be caught out by another Russian military operation.\n\n\"Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,\" Blinken said late last year.\n\nWhat other factors are at play?\n\nUnrest in the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan was unwelcome news for Putin at the beginning of 2022.\n\nDeadly protests in early January saw the Kazakh government resign, a state of emergency be declared and troops from a Russia-led military alliance deployed to help contain the unrest.\n\nBut experts have warned that Russia's intervention is unlikely to be the end of the story . Blinken said that \"once Russians are in your house, sometimes it is very difficult to get them to leave.\"\n\nAnother issue revolves around energy supply. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine.\n\nKyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against an invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAnalysts and US lawmakers have raised concerns that Nord Stream 2 will increase European dependence on Russian gas and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cut-offs, without broader disruption to European supplies. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of lucrative transit fees Russia would otherwise pay.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration waived sanctions on the company behind Nord Stream 2, effectively giving it the green light. US officials say the move was in the interest of US national security as it sought to rebuild frayed relations with Germany.\n\nIn November, the US imposed new sanctions on a Russian-linked entity and a vessel linked to Nord Stream 2. Some US senators have called for further sanctions to be imposed to prevent Russia using the pipeline as a weapon; Ukraine too has called for tougher measures.", "authors": ["Matthew Chance", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/asia/the-quad-tokyo-summit-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What is the Quad? The partnership between the US, Japan ...", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) US President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet the leaders of India, Australia and Japan in Tokyo on Tuesday for a summit of the \"Quad\" nations.\n\nThe meeting comes at the end of Biden's first trip to Asia since becoming President, a five-day visit he began in South Korea.\n\nThe Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s. It has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China's reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe war in Ukraine , North Korea's weapons program, Taiwan, and a controversial new security deal between China and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific are among the issues likely to be discussed at the summit.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Quad.\n\nHow did it form?\n\nThe partnership has its roots in the response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the four countries set up a \"regional core group\" to help relief efforts. But the Quad in its current form was created in 2007 and held its first meeting in May that year.\n\nIn a speech several months after that first meeting, Japan's then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described his vision of a \"broader Asia ... an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, incorporating the United States of America and Australia.\"\n\nThe countries shared \"fundamental values\" such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests, he said.\n\nThe initiative fell apart in 2008 under intense pressure from China and the threat of economic retaliation, said Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBut it was revived in 2017 amid renewed concerns about China's rapid rise as a global superpower and Beijing's increasingly aggressive foreign policy.\n\nSince then, the group has grown more active, with the four heads of state holding a symbolic virtual meeting in March 2021, before then meeting in person for the first time in September that year.\n\nAt the time, a senior US official emphasized the Quad was \"an unofficial gathering,\" but called it \"a key and critical format,\" adding \"we are deepening coordination on a daily basis.\"\n\nA meeting of the Quad leaders at a summit at the White House on September 24, 2021.\n\nWhat does the Quad do?\n\nThough sometimes dubbed by critics as an \"Asian NATO,\" the Quad is not a formal military alliance -- rather, it's an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.\n\nIt does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.\n\n\"It's deliberately more amorphous than that, so that it can withstand changes in political decision-making in each of the democracies, and respond in a more diffuse but effective way around things like vaccines or economics,\" Paskal said.\n\nQuad members cooperate across fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.\n\nBut security and the goal of a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\" are key focuses, with the four nations frequently highlighting threats such as terrorism, disinformation and territorial disputes.\n\nAircraft carriers and warships participate in the Malabar naval exercises, attended by the US, Australia, India and Japan, in the Northern Arabian Sea on November 17, 2020.\n\nMilitary cooperation has increased in recent years, with Australia joining the other three in the 2020 Malabar naval exercises -- the first time all four members had participated in the drills since 2007.\n\nLast September, the US, the United Kingdom and Australia signed a security deal known as AUKUS that will eventually bring nuclear-powered submarines to the region -- a move that set off a diplomatic firestorm with France and angered China.\n\nAnd this January, Japan and Australia signed a treaty to strengthen defense and security cooperation, with Australia saying the agreement included \"an expanding agenda for the Quad.\"\n\nHow does China play into this?\n\nThe Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China's growing reach in the region, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing over the past few years.\n\nThe India-China relationship has come under growing strain since May 2020 when troops from both sides were involved in a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nAustralia and China have been involved in a series of trade spats since Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while Japan and China remain at odds over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nThe US-China relationship has also steadily deteriorated, exacerbated by a trade war, pandemic finger-pointing and military saber-rattling.\n\nThe strategic location of each of the Quad nations -- at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them -- has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China \"clique\" that is emblematic of a \"poisonous\" Cold War mentality.\n\nA Chinese airstrip on a man-made island in the South China Sea, seen on March 20.\n\nExacerbating these tensions, China has reiterated its territorial claims and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges. In recent years, China has built up its military positions in the South China Sea, despite a UN tribunal dismissing its territorial claims there. It has also ramped up threats against Taiwan -- a self-governing island the Chinese Communist Party sees as part of its territory despite never having ruled it -- and has sent fighter jets into its air defense identification zone.\n\n\"China's rise is now the global phenomenon that not (only) involves the neighboring nations, but also the safety of maritime security in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, all the way to the Indian Ocean,\" said Ken Jimbo, a professor in the faculty of policy management at Japan's Keio University.\n\nIn April, China announced a security pact with the Solomon Islands, sparking protests from Australia, New Zealand and the US. Many were concerned it would allow China to build a military base in the tiny Pacific nation, though the islands' leader has said he has no intention of this happening.\n\nStill, some onlookers say the agreement makes Australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the Solomon Islands, where the government's close relationship with Beijing has already sparked protests.\n\n\"What countries are realizing more and more is that the economic investment from China is designed to lead to a weakening of political will within those countries ... which brings it more strongly into the Chinese orbit,\" said Paskal, from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nWhat are the other major issues?\n\nOther issues that may come up at the summit include the security of Taiwan.\n\nthat China might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over Taiwan, and the island faces an \"acute\" threat between now and 2030. A recent surge of Chinese air incursions has raised fears for the future of the democratic island . Top US intelligence officials told Congress this month that China might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over Taiwan, and the island faces an \"acute\" threat between now and 2030.\n\nQuad members have voiced support for Taiwan, which the US supplies with arms for self defense. On Monday, during a press conference in Japan, US President Joe Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force , a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don't reflect a change in US policy.\n\nBut many analysts have drawn parallels between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan's situation -- concerns echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, when he said peace in the Taiwan Strait was \"critical\" and countries must \"never tolerate\" forceful attempts to change the status quo in East Asia.\n\n\"If Taiwan falls to China, that breaks the first island chain and compromises Japanese security,\" Paskal said. \"The fall of Taiwan is a deep security threat to all four Quad partners.\"\n\nNorth Korea and its weapons program will also likely be on the table, said Jimbo, the Keio University professor. The country has recently stepped up its missile testing, in defiance of international law and to the alarm of Japan and the US. It has launched 15 missile tests this year so far, compared to four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021.\n\nIndia has long enjoyed friendly relations and a defense relationship with Moscow; most estimates suggest more than 50% of India's military equipment comes from Russia. These supplies are vital, given India's border tensions with both China and Pakistan.\n\nThough India's position has caused \"a significant amount of frustration\" among the other three bloc members, Jimbo said \"it also reminds us that we do not really have the luxury to lose India from the Quad -- so obviously, we are going to pursue what we can agree (on) at this point together with India.\"", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/joe-biden-voter-polls-press-conference/index.html", "title": "Biden's \"I don't believe polls\" is the worst answer from his press ...", "text": "(CNN) It was one of Joe Biden's shortest answers in his nearly-two hour press conference Wednesday.\n\nIt was also the worst.\n\nHe was asked, \"How do you plan to win back moderates and independents who cast a ballot for you in 2020 but, polls indicate, aren't happy with the way you're doing your job now?\" The President responded this way: \"I don't believe the polls.\"\n\nWhich, well, what?\n\nIf you heard echoes of former President Donald Trump in that answer, you're not alone.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Analysis Chris Cillizza", "Cnn Editor-At-Large"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/biden-democrats-midterm-election/index.html", "title": "Biden leaves Democrats hanging as midterms burst into full swing ...", "text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden spotted Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney on the White House campus last June and called out to the House Democratic campaign chair loudly enough for several others to hear: \"I really want to talk to you about the races!\" he shouted.\n\nA week later, at the cherry festival in Traverse City, Michigan, Biden leaned into Sen. Gary Peters, who's in charge of Democratic Senate campaigns, with the same promise. He's always cared most about Senate races , Biden told the Michigan Democrat, and he wanted to have a meeting, an hour at least, to talk about helping his party hold the chamber in 2022.\n\nMaloney's staff eagerly followed up. So did Peters'. Then they followed up again. And again. Seven months later, there are still no meetings on the books.\n\nThey're not the only ones who've been left waiting. In three dozen exclusive interviews with CNN, top Democratic politicians, campaign officials and operatives say the White House political operation is heading into the midterms unprepared and unresponsive even to basic requests for help or information.\n\nBiden advisers say that the President talks politics with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, but people familiar with both leaders say any campaign talk has been brief, and Democratic leaders have significant concerns with the White House's approach to getting the President to break through. It's not just that Biden's approval ratings have tumbled . Those in charge of keeping Democrats in power doubt that Biden's team understands how to improve his political fate -- and with it, theirs.\n\n\"It's hard for me to believe that the President knows how little his political shop is doing to support Democratic majorities in the Senate and the House. All of us believe that the President would be shocked to learn how little the White House political team is doing,\" said one senior Democratic elected official in Washington, voicing widespread worries about the midterms. \"We just know Joe Biden, and we know how much he cares about this stuff.\"\n\nBiden shakes hands with Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the DSCC, left, during an event on the South Lawn of the White House in August 2021.\n\nSenior Democrats, including some White House aides, describe a West Wing lacking both a political strategy and the discipline to execute one. Focus groups are giving party operatives nightmares. Biden is coming across as old and absent, they say. Real and perceived fumbles play into deep fears that he's not up to the job and that Democrats are incompetent. Few Americans can say what was in the massive bills he's signed, though many have heard about Democratic infighting and failure in what he hasn't signed.\n\n\"What is the plan to fix that?\" asked one operative in touch with the White House. \"They can't tell us what they're talking about next week.\"\n\nThough most Democrats in power believe there's still ample time for a turnaround, several top operatives are already talking triage. They're fearful of discussing all of this publicly because they don't want to create more problems. But privately, they are petrified that a Republican majority would end Biden's agenda and swamp them with endless investigations and subpoenas, promise impeachment and potentially endanger fair certification of the next presidential election. All this comes as former President Donald Trump has begun assembling a stricter political operation from Mar-a-Lago, aiming to use a strong presence and win record in 2022 to potentially bulldoze his way through 2024.\n\n\"It doesn't strike me as they're dealing with the politics with the urgency of what's currently at stake,\" said one high-level operative working on House campaigns.\n\nWhite House aides downplayed these complaints. The President has been more focused on addressing the pandemic and global economy than helping plot campaign strategy. They chalk much of the grumbling up to officials upset that they're not getting everything they want, including Maloney's unprecedented request last year for the Democratic National Committee to transfer $20 million to House Democrats' campaign committee. (So far, $0 has been transferred). The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee declined to comment for this story.\n\nBiden and his aides are currently in a natural shift to campaign mode, they argue, with one Biden adviser telling CNN the President and those in his orbit believe there's ample time for his numbers to climb back to a strong position before November.\n\n\"History is against us, and we have work to do here,\" the adviser said. \"But I am not over-torqued by where we are, because we have the right story, we have the right person who can connect with people. ... We have to work harder, but we have the ingredients and the pieces.\"\n\nPart of what's happening, Democrats acknowledge, is that some of their colleagues are blaming Biden for all their political problems.\n\n\"We haven't talked about our accomplishments near enough. The accomplishments by definition will delineate who's for what, and who's not for what,\" said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat and former DSCC chair. \"I point the finger at myself as much as everybody in the Senate, as much as everybody in the House, as much as everybody in the executive branch.\"\n\nThe Biden adviser dismissed the worst poll numbers floating around and pointed out that Biden's polling average is around 43% -- still a devastating number in the eyes of many Democrats.\n\n\"We want our numbers to get better, of course,\" the adviser said. \"But we have time.\"\n\nBrian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, speaks on the phone during a bipartisan infrastructure meeting at the Capitol on June 23, 2021.\n\nIt's how they're using their time that worries people, though, with less than nine months to go until the midterms. In early December, Biden sent two very senior staffers -- his communications director and his National Economic Council director -- to the Hill to meet with the Democratic senators in charge of steering their caucus agenda. Kate Bedingfield and Brian Deese delivered a PowerPoint presentation, urging the lawmakers to craft a \"Whose side are you on?\" appeal to voters.\n\nSens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan ripped into the White House suggestions. They wanted stronger contrasts, a clearer case. Senators in the room wanted Biden to call Republicans out as \"shills\" for corporate interests and blame them for endangering public health and the economy.\n\n\"This is not strong enough,\" Stabenow told the White House delegation, according to several sources in the room.\n\nBedingfield and Deese listened. \"This is helpful feedback,\" said Bedingfield.\n\nThe White House followed up with updated talking points. The senators were left unconvinced that they'd been heard.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, seen here in the Capitol in December, didn't think the White House's message was strong enough.\n\n'Who is in charge? Who is running the thing?'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama was infamous for never investing much in electing Democrats other than himself, whether heading into the 2010 midterms or the rest of his presidency -- even housing a separate group that soon became his reelection campaign within the DNC. Trump's political office, like the rest of that White House, subsisted on the whims of his Twitter feed.\n\nUnlike either, Biden came into office telling his staff he wanted to prioritize building up the party and maximizing his connections to allies on Capitol Hill and beyond.\n\nThis isn't how it's played out. According to many in Congress, at the various Democratic campaign arms and others involved in Democratic politics, the Biden White House doesn't have a clear point of contact for allies. There's a White House political director, Emmy Ruiz, but insiders say she has never really been empowered with either the carrots or sticks that could make her, and the office, more effective externally -- while some on her staff are viewed internally as more loyal to other Democratic causes than to Biden. Jen O'Malley Dillon , who ran Biden's general election campaign, now serves as the main conduit in the West Wing for political decisions, but many in touch with her complain of a bottleneck that slows responses, if they come at all.\n\nSteve Ricchetti, the trusted Biden aide who sits a few steps away from the Oval Office, is the official point person for conversations with Congress. But Cedric Richmond, director of public engagement, is doing a lot of the outreach to his former peers in the House.\n\n\"Who is in charge? Who is running the thing?\" said one exasperated Democratic House member, requesting anonymity to speak candidly about their frustration.\n\nSeveral who've known the President for years think that part of why Biden's political operation isn't like they're used to -- the constant check-ins, the promises of campaign appearances, the donors used to him grabbing their phones and calling their grandmothers -- is that for so long, that operation essentially existed within his own head, even as vice president.\n\nBiden speaks to the press after attending a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nThe Biden operation has taken a very different approach than Obama's did to the DNC. The campaign turned over his email list at the beginning of last year, which has helped generate massive fundraising. A DNC official tells CNN that emails signed by the President have raised $20.7 million. The campaign also gave the DNC control of the @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris Twitter accounts, effective tools in amplifying the work of the administration. There's been a bus tour, billboards, TV ads, and an \"America is Back\" ice cream truck escapade.\n\nBuilding Back Together, the independent group that Biden allies started in an effort to avoid a repeat of 2010, when Democrats felt abandoned by Obama ahead of the midterms, has spent over $30 million promoting Biden's agenda and providing cover to many Democrats who complain of being left out in the cold. A spokesperson for the group said to expect \"doubling down on these investments\" over the course of 2022.\n\nBut without a centralized system at work outside Biden's own brain, the politics are coming off a bit scatter-shot. Other high-level Democratic leaders in the House and Senate tell CNN they often hear conflicting messages from different contacts in the White House -- if they hear anything at all. And what they do hear can be insulting. House Democrats have been anxious about the state of the party's agenda, but when Bedingfield met with them last month to talk about messaging Build Back Better and acknowledged the many concerns raised, several walked out still feeling forlorn.\n\n\"They didn't hear what members are feeling,\" one member of Congress said. \"They're not hearing what members are doing.\"\n\nThe revised talking points that the White House wrote and sent out following the meetings with Senate and House Democrats didn't put concerns like that to rest. The various Democratic campaign operations have received almost no commitments to fundraising events, multiple sources familiar with the planning tell CNN, and not nearly as many as they wanted over 2021. They feel like not enough attention is being paid to prioritizing endangered Democrats in minor ways, like their placement in the photos at bill signings, and in more significant ways, like which districts the President travels to for events.\n\nRon Klain is the White House chief of staff.\n\nThey can't get the White House to lean on local Democratic officials to push back against political maps gerrymandered against their interests. Pleading memos written inside and outside the White House rarely get acknowledgments, let alone responses. Major donors don't get their calls returned; some complained to CNN of being relegated to mid-level aides following up with their secretaries. And as even small commitments have proven impossible to nail down, frustration has curdled into bitterness.\n\n\"It's not that we have been told no,\" said one campaign aide. \"It's that we haven't gotten an answer.\"\n\nThe structure and orientation of the White House -- and the decisions about how to press the President to use his time -- are up to Ron Klain , the White House chief of staff, who is also often in contact with many members of Congress. When other White House aides or politically minded allies outside the building point to the struggles Biden is having, Klain often says they have a problem of \"amplification,\" according to people familiar with the internal conversations. He tells people that Cabinet secretaries and other surrogates should be out there talking about the Biden agenda, and thus generating better news coverage.\n\nThis comes off to many as disconnected from the external and internal realities they're facing. Cabinet secretaries aren't highly sought after for bookings, especially without news or interesting moments to highlight. Meanwhile, the White House counsel's office has been hawkish in pressing against appearances that they fear could violate Hatch Act limitations on public servants and their political activity.\n\nRep. Colin Allred says there may have been different expectations about working with a first-term White House.\n\nBut Rep. Colin Allred, who won a battleground Texas seat in 2018, said he's been pleased with the three Cabinet secretary visits he's had. He attributes the despair among his colleagues to a combination of not having worked with a first-term White House -- \"There may be some different expectations of what that was going to be like than what the reality actually can deliver,\" he said -- and the \"existential\" fear Democrats feel with Republicans seeming to have the political upper hand heading into the midterm year.\n\nStill, multiple White House aides and outside operatives told CNN of a frustrating lack of long-term political strategy, from Klain or anyone else. Some days, they say, it feels like their work is defined by cable TV chyrons and topics trending on Twitter. This is exacerbated, several aides said, by Klain's constant presence on Twitter. When the White House gets distracted by the controversy-of-the-day, some of them blame it on the Twitter fixation.\n\nKlain declined to speak to CNN, but a White House aide speaking on his behalf argued that what some are writing off as distraction is rather the reality of bouncing between constant crises and said that Klain's \"amplification\" complaint reflects his belief that more voters would support Biden if they were hearing more of what the administration has been doing.\n\nA central complaint, according to several aides as well as operatives outside the building, is that Klain hasn't pressed Biden to respond in more forceful ways. Besides a sharper organization, many Democrats want a bolder, looser Biden, out there defending his work rather than reading scripted remarks. Biden has given some in the building the sense that he's afraid of making a mistake, asking for lots of prep ahead of interviews and thus slowing the internal process. Meanwhile, White House aides have left outside allies feeling that they're nervous that more speaking events could result in embarrassing stumbles.\n\n\"What gaffe could you make to make things worse than 39%?\" one operative asked, referring to the worst of Biden's approval ratings.\n\n\"Why are they driving hard at a loss on voting rights? Why do they make everything about the legislation?\" asked another Democratic strategist in touch with the administration. \"Go fight Republicans.\"\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who chaired the DSCC during the 2014 midterms and is up for reelection in the fall, said he'd like to see Biden lead a forceful \"Whose side are you on?\" argument that returns to the original pitch of paying for Build Back Better with measures like rolling back the Trump tax cuts.\n\n\"People are really, really grumpy. I'm grumpy too. I'm not grumpy about the White House not being involved on the political side of things. I'm grumpy because we haven't been able to pass legislation that I think would be good for the country, and that we should be able to tell people about so that we can hold off a beginning of a return to Donald Trump,\" Bennet said. \"He'd be a lot better off and we would be having him spend his time out in the country talking to people than stuck in Washington talking to people about legislating.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin greets Biden in Michigan in October 2021.\n\nBiden's posture of determination and strength is what people like, said a high-ranking Democratic official.\n\n\"That's why people voted for him,\" the official said. \"They felt like there was an assurance that things were going to get better. We need that strength. That strength needs to come from him and from across the party, that we know what the hell we're doing, and we're in it for you.\"\n\nDespite his overall poll numbers, Biden still doesn't draw the kind of animosity that made Obama and Trump so polarizing. \"There's 220 Democrats who would welcome Joe Biden to come to their districts,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat and member of House leadership.\n\n\"The paradox of his poll numbers is that members of the Senate and House do not see him as a political liability when he shows up in person,\" said the senior Democratic elected official, complaining that the White House operation isn't utilizing Biden well. \"The solution is more Joe Biden, not less.\"\n\nBiden senses the problem\n\nBiden knows he has a problem, at least in terms of his public message. In meetings with staffers, he'll occasionally remark on his poll numbers and express exasperation that his message isn't breaking through.\n\n\"Why is no one seeing it?\" Biden will say, according to a source privy to the conversations.\n\nLately, signs are popping up that the White House political operation is trying to do better. O'Malley Dillon hosted a call with Democratic governors' staffs last week, suggesting ways they could help tout infrastructure projects stemming from the bipartisan infrastructure law -- one of Biden's greatest accomplishments to date. She approved the first DCCC fundraising email to be signed by the President. Two days later, major DNC donors received an invitation to an upcoming call with Ricchetti.\n\nBiden greets attendees at the Mack Trucks Lehigh Valley Operations facility in Macungie, Pennsylvania, in July 2021.\n\nInternal White House memos prepared by multiple aides in recent months, and described to CNN, argue that Biden performs best when he's talking off-the-cuff with people instead of delivering speeches. In these memos and conversations, aides and outside advisers suggest he show up more on social media and do small events around the country in living rooms and small businesses -- maybe even some kind of consistent fireside chat, with the dogs wandering around in the background.\n\nSome would love to have seen an Oval Office address, maximizing the bully pulpit power to push infrastructure or even voting rights. At the very least, they argue, the President and Democrats alike would be helped by making big speeches -- like the daytime addresses on January 6 or voting rights -- in primetime, when he would reach more people and have a better chance of breaking through.\n\nThe President and many White House aides are pinning their hopes on voter patience: they expect the Omicron spike and the panic over the Covid-19 testing shortage to fade in the next few weeks, and that by the summer, America will be back on track to endemic times. There's a renewed, if mostly whispered, confidence in the West Wing that parts of a scaled back Build Back Better bill can still pass. Roll that together with potential better economic news and an emboldened Trump creating renewed toxicity around Republicans, they say, and the national mood could be in a very different place by the time most swing voters make up their minds later this year.\n\n\"It's been hard times for families with the pandemic and the challenges that that has brought. Folks will feel better when things in their world are going better,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, who chairs the moderate New Democrat Coalition, which includes many purple district members.\n\nRep. Suzan DelBene chairs the New Democrat Coalition.\n\nGetting people to credit Biden and the Democrats, if things do turn around, is the trick, say strategists.\n\n\"The case we have to make now is not, 'Are you better off than you were?' It's, 'Are you getting better?'\" said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who works extensively with polling data and political advertising and was a top official at the House Democrats' campaign arm during the Obama years. \"It's not about how everything is hunky dory, but just that the country is getting up off the mat.\"\n\nNoting all of the complaints, the Biden adviser promised the White House will do better.\n\n\"We're in this next phase of the presidency and the midterms,\" the adviser said. \"We want no one to have complaints. But if that is the complaint, we will diminish that complaint, because that's exactly what he's going to be doing.\"\n\nPeople have written off Biden before, like when his primary campaign was coming apart before his resounding win in South Carolina. But this isn't just about other Democrats' political prospects: the states with the most competitive races this November also happen to be those that will decide the next presidential election.\n\n\"We look at this,\" said the Biden adviser, \"as building a foundation for '24 by doing the work of '22.\"\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify comments from Klobuchar.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/biden-news-conference/index.html", "title": "Biden signals a change in approach as he heads toward second ...", "text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden laid out his vision for the next chapter of his presidency during a nearly two-hour-long White House news conference on Wednesday, saying he's prepared to make changes as he faces crises at home and abroad.\n\nAs he heads into year two in the Oval Office, Biden held a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with reporters during which he angered his Ukrainian allies with comments about a potential Russian \"incursion\" into their country, and he admitted he would be breaking up one of his major legislative priorities. Biden also signaled that his dreams of bipartisanship had largely been dashed during his first year in office, though he was still confident in how his party will do in the 2022 midterm elections\n\nBiden told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that he's ready to switch up his approach during the coming year. After spending much of his first year in office at the White House or one of his Delaware properties, Biden said he wants to solicit more outside advice and speak to more people outside the building.\n\nThe President has traveled less often than his predecessors, restrained by the pandemic. He has visited comparatively fewer states and been outside the US only twice.\n\n\"I'm going to go out and talk to the public. I'm going to do public fora. I'm going to interface with them. I'm going to make the case of what we've already done, why it's important and what we'll do -- what will happen if they support what else I want to do,\" he said.\n\nBiden said he also plans to engage more with Democrats during the midterm elections.\n\n\"I'm going to be deeply involved in these off-year elections,\" he said. \"We're going to be raising a lot of money. We're going to be out there making sure that we're helping all those candidates, and scores of them already asked me to come in and campaign with them, to go out and make the case in plain simple language as to what it is we have done, what we want to do and why we think it's important.\"\n\nStill, despite his planned changes, the President defended his approach to many issues, saying he \"makes no apologies\" for his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and dismissing questions of competency in regards to the rollout of 5G networks and the response to Covid-19.\n\nHe said he's satisfied with his team, confirming that Vice President Kamala Harris will be his reelection running mate and defending top public health officials, like US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, amid mixed messaging on the pandemic.\n\nBreaking up Build Back Better\n\nThe President said he's changing his approach to how he handles a signature legislative goal, saying he believes Congress can pass \"big chunks\" of his sweeping social safety net and climate spending plan, Build Back Better, and acknowledging that negotiators will have to \"fight for the rest later.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, it's clear to me that we're going to have to break it up,\" the President said.\n\nIn particular, Biden indicated that he believes Congress can pass funding for energy and environmental issues, and that he has support from West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a key moderate, on the plan's early education proposals. In addition, he indicated that there's \"strong support\" for the proposal on how the provisions will be paid for.\n\nHe later said he's \"unsure\" whether he'll be able to get the child tax credit provision and funding to assist with the cost of college passed.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything unrealistic about what we're asking for. I'm not asking for castles in the sky. I'm asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time. A long time. And I think we can get it done,\" he said.\n\nBiden cited lower prices for on prescription drugs, expanded education funding and support for child care as popular provisions.\n\n\"I don't know many things that have been done in one fell swoop. And so I think the most important thing to do is try to inform ... the public what's at stake in stark terms and let them make judgments and let them know who is for them and who is against them. Who is there and who is not there, and make that the case. That's what I'm going to be spending my time doing in this off-year election,\" Biden continued.\n\nThe President also acknowledged that passing his other legislative priority, voting reform, will be difficult. Still, he insisted that Democrats still have options to get it passed.\n\nBiden said the perception by some Americans that his push to pass election reform is a last-minute effort is a \"problem that is my own making,\" stressing that he has been fighting to ensure Americans have access to the ballot for decades.\n\n\"It's going to be difficult. I make no bones about that. It's going to be difficult, but we're not there yet. We've not run out of options yet. And we'll see how this moves,\" Biden told reporters.\n\nLater Wednesday, Biden issued a statement after Senate Democrats failed to change Senate rules to advance two major voting rights measures, saying, \"I am profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am disappointed — but I am not deterred.\"\n\n\"As dangerous new Republican laws plainly designed to suppress and subvert voting rights proliferate in states across the country, we will explore every measure and use every tool at our disposal to stand up for democracy,\" the President added later.\n\nBiden touts year of 'challenges' and 'progress'\n\nBiden, in his opening comments at the news conference, said that \"it's been a year of challenges, but it's also been a year of enormous progress.\"\n\nThe President -- who fielded questions from reporters as his administration struggles to contain the latest surge of the Omicron coronavirus variant and works to ease the economic anxiety gripping the nation -- began his White House news conference touting how the administration has made strides in Covid-19 vaccinations, reopening the economy, creating jobs and lowering unemployment. But he also acknowledged the challenges facing his administration as he enters his second year in office. He said there continues to be \"frustration and fatigue in this country\" over Covid-19, reiterating that \"while it's cause for concern, it's not cause for panic.\"\n\nThe President conceded that his team should have done more to ramp up testing, but listed steps he's taken to make kits more available, arguing that \"we're in a better place than we have been thus far, clearly better than a year ago.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to give up and accept things as they are now. Some people may call what's happening now the new normal. I call it a job not yet finished. It will get better. We're moving toward a time when Covid-19 won't disrupt our daily lives,\" he continued.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the President also addressed the economic complications of the pandemic, including rising prices for consumers, saying, \"We need to get inflation under control\" and calling on the Federal Reserve to \"bear down on fighting inflation.\"\n\nBiden added that he respects the independence of the Fed.\n\nThe news conference comes as the President heads into his second year in office -- a midterm election year -- after facing a number of recent setbacks. The centerpiece of his economic agenda has hit a roadblock in Congress, it is unclear whether the Democrats' push for voting rights legislation will go anywhere, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's vaccine mandates for big businesses and recent key economic indicators show record inflation.\n\nPredicting Russia will invade Ukraine\n\nBiden predicted a Russian invasion of Ukraine, citing existential concerns by the country's President Vladimir Putin, even as he warned of significant economic consequences when such an incursion occurs. But he suggested a \"minor incursion\" would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion.\n\nPutin has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and appears poised to invade.\n\n\"I'm not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,\" Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world: \"He is trying to find his place in the world between China and the West.\"\n\nBiden's prediction of an invasion is the firmest acknowledgment to date that the US fully expects Putin to move after amassing 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border.\n\nThe President also said allies and partners \"are ready to impose severe cost and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.\"\n\nThat includes limiting Russian transactions in US financial institutions -- \"anything that involves dollar denominations,\" Biden said.\n\nHe also warned Russian lives would be lost in an invasion, along with potential Ukranian casualties.\n\nBiden speculated Putin was not seeking \"any full-blown war,\" but said he did believe the Russian leader was looking for some type of confrontation.\n\n\"Do I think he'll test the West? Test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he'll pay a serious and dear price for it.\"\n\n\"He doesn't think it will cost him what it's going to cost him,\" he said. \"And I think he'll regret having done it.\"\n\nAnger at the GOP\n\nThroughout the news conference, Biden indicated his frustration with GOP lawmakers who have stood against his agenda.\n\nHe claimed that Republicans were not as \"obstructionist\" toward former President Barack Obama as they are to his own administration.\n\n\"They weren't nearly as obstructionist as they are now,\" Biden said when pressed on similarities in the Republican Party's obstruction tactics to both his and the Obama administrations.\n\n\"The difference here is there seems to be a desire ... what are they for? What is their agenda? They had an agenda back in the administration -- the eight years we were President and vice president -- but I don't know what their agenda is now. What is it?\" Biden stated.\n\nSpeaking of his time as vice president in the Obama administration, Biden said the difference is they were able to \"get some things done\" when the atmosphere wasn't ideologically divisive.\n\nEarlier in the news conference, Biden said that \"one thing\" he hasn't been able to do is \"get my Republican friends to get in the game in making things better for this country.\"\n\n\"I did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden did not get anything done. Think about this. What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's presidential news conference record\n\nThe President regularly fields questions from reporters after delivering remarks and during departures and arrivals at the White House, but he hasn't held as many formal news conferences as his recent predecessors.\n\nIn his first year in office, Biden held nine total news conferences -- six solo and three joint ones -- according to data tracked by The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara . The last time he held a formal news conference was at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.\n\nBy comparison, President Donald Trump held 21 news conferences in his first year in office, but just one of them was solo and the rest were joint appearances, usually with foreign leaders. (In his last year in office, as the pandemic took hold, Trump held a staggering 35 solo news conferences.)\n\nPresident Barack Obama held 27 news conferences in his first year -- 11 solo and 16 of them joint. President George W. Bush held 19 news conferences -- five solo and 14 joint, according to UCSB data. Then-President Bill Clinton held 12 solo news conferences and 26 joint ones, resulting in 38 news conferences in his first year in office.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/new-york-democrats-congressional-map/index.html", "title": "Democrats intensify efforts to stop implementation of draft New York ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is intensifying efforts to stop the implementation of a draft congressional map that would pit several Democratic incumbents against one another in the midterms and has exacerbated sensitive divisions in the caucus.\n\nThe controversy, which Democratic leaders are trying to tamp down in order to avoid a full-blown public brawl, has led some members to question whether DCCC Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney is the man to lead them during a midterm season that is already daunting for the party.\n\nIn a new letter provided first to CNN, the DCCC, along with several constituents affected by the redistricting, call on a New York court to reconsider Monday's draft congressional map that the DCCC argues would undo \"decades of hard-fought racial progress\" and fracture \"important communities of interest throughout New York.\"\n\n\"The Proposed Map is the result of a flawed process that did not provide the public, including minority voters who live in historically marginalized communities, with an opportunity to provide input,\" the letter says. \"We urge the Special Master to uncouple Black incumbents and reunite communities of interest around New York City, on Long Island, and in the Hudson River Valley.\"\n\nIn the letter, the DCCC argues that the proposed congressional map could potentially pit four Black incumbents against one another out of the seven Black members from the New York delegation, reducing diverse representation that has been shaped over decades.

Biden was in Washington at the time of the accident.\n\n“I was not able to be there,” Biden said after a noticeable pause.\n\nBiden urged listeners to reach out to those who had been through a similar experience and to “seek help afterwards so they know, they can tell you that you can get through it.”\n\nHe then almost said his phone number on the air but stopped himself and encouraged those who have lost loved-ones from the coronavirus and are suffering from that experience to contact his campaign, saying he’d be “happy” to talk to them.\n\n“You know, I’ve lost a couple children, I’ve lost a wife, and it is incredibly difficult to go through, and it's harder to go through when you haven’t had an opportunity to be with the person while they’re dying,” Biden said.\n\n– Savannah Behrmann\n\nBiden says he’s spoken to governors struggling with coronavirus outbreak\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said during a CNN town hall on Friday that he has spoken with a number of governors as their states deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBiden named several governors, including Washington’s Jay Inslee and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday he has asked Vice President Mike Pence not to call governors he says have not been \"appreciative\" enough of his efforts on coronavirus. These included Whitmer, whom Trump referred to as “the woman in Michigan,” and Inslee, whom he called a “failed presidential candidate.”\n\nBiden says he was calling to “to see what’s happening on the ground for them,” naming other Democratic governors as well. The former vice president said he had also spoken to some Republican governors.\n\nHe said on CNN that he would urge the governors to lock down their respective states in hopes of stalling the spread nationwide of the virus: “Why would we not err on the side of making sure we are not going to have a repeat?”\n\nBiden then spoke personally to Trump via the virtual town hall about the president’s feud with a few of the governors. He said: \"This is not personal. It has nothing to do with you, Donald Trump, nothing to do with you. Do your job. Stop personalizing everything.\"\n\n– Savannah Behrmann\n\nDonald Trump tells Mike Pence not to talk to 'the woman in Michigan'\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Friday he has asked Vice President Mike Pence not to call governors that he says have not been \"appreciative\" enough of his efforts on coronavirus – a group of critics that included a governor he referred to only by gender.\n\n\"Don't call the woman in Michigan,\" Trump said while discussing Pence's work as head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\n\nThat governor – Gretchen Whitmer – replied on Twitter that \"right now, we all need to be focused on fighting the virus, not each other. I’m willing to work with anyone as long as we get the personal protective equipment we need for the people of Michigan.\"\n\nBesides, there was a suggestion that the White House will continue talking to the governor of Michigan anyway.\n\nTrump at one point said Pence will hear his instruction not to deal with critical governors, but \"he'll call quietly anyway.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nTrump has rare words of praise for the media\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump offered rare words of praise for the media on Friday for the way news organizations have reported on the coronavirus epidemic.\n\n“A lot of the media has been fair,” Trump said at a White House briefing. “I’m not used to fair treatment in the media. I don’t know how to handle it.”\n\nTrump said that while he still has issues with some outlets, journalists in general view the coronavirus response as: \"We're all in a problem together, and we’re going to win.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTrump said he'll meet with experts on whether to extend 15-day guidelines\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he will be sitting down with his health care advisers early next week to decide whether to extend the 15-day guidelines on social distancing and other safety measures to slow the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe guidelines expire Monday.\n\n- Michael Collins\n\nTrump threatens to use Defense Production Act to force automakers to make ventilators\n\nPresident Donald Trump ramped up his threat Friday to use a Korean War era law to force American automakers to manufacture ventilators needed for critically ill coronavirus patients, but it was not clear how he intended to use the act.\n\nTrump signed an order Friday directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services investigate applying the Defense Production Act against General Motors, which volunteered to make ventilators but which the president said stalled in that effort.\n\nIn a press conference Friday, Trump said he had invoked the act and that the action would lead to the creation of 100,000 more ventilators.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis,\" Trump said. \"We have to get these people on board.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats and some state officials have pressed the Trump administration to invoke the act, but Trump has been hesitant to do so. The act has several provisions: A president can incentivize the manufacture of products, for instance, or require companies to redirect products they are making to the government in times of national emergency.\n\nIt was not immediately clear which of the many powers under the act Trump was referring to. Nor is it clear that the government can require a company to manufacture a product it generally does not make. Trump's order gave authority to the secretary of Health and Human Services to use all powers available under the law.\n\nOfficials at the department did not respond to a request for further information.\n\nThe administration has claimed it has invoked the act at least two other times, but those have been less controversial provisions such as creating anti-hoarding requirements.\n\n- John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: UK, Spain, Italy and Germany want American ventilators\n\nPresident Donald Trump said UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson, who revealed he tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, told the president he wants ventilators when the two spoke by phone earlier Friday.\n\nTrump said in the next 100 days the U.S. will either make or get 100,000 additional ventilators.\n\nTrump said the U.S. plans to share any surplus of ventilators with other countries that have asked for them. Trump also said Italy, Spain and Germany want ventilators from the United States.\n\n\"All over the world they want them, and we're in a position to make them. Other countries aren't,\" Trump said.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: Boeing will produce plastic face shields\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Boeing will produce and donate plastic face shields to help medical workers on the frontlines treating people with coronavirus.\n\n“They’re going to do thousands of these per week,” he said during a White House press briefing on Friday.\n\nTrump said he spoke to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who told the president the company would also offer to let the federal government use three Dreamliner planes to distribute medical supplies across the country.\n\nAs it relates to medical equipment, Trump said, \"We're going to be in very good shape\"\n\n- Maureen Groppe and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrade adviser Navarro to coordinate Defense Production Act\n\nPresident Donald Trump said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was designated to be the national Defense Production Act policy coordinator under the executive order the president signed earlier today implementing the Defense Production Act.\n\nTrump made the announcement at a White House press briefing Friday.\n\nThe wartime act allows the president to direct companies to speed the production of medical equipment including ventilators, masks and other supplies to help health care workers treat coronavirus patients.\n\n\"We will work in partnership with the private sector,” Trump said, but in an emergency, “we will do what we have to do.”\n\nNavarro told reporters the administration \"ran into roadblocks\" with General Motors in negotiating a deal to manufacture ventilators. \"We can't afford to lose a single day,\" he said of Trump's decision to implement the DPA on Friday.\n\nTrump said he thought he had a deal with GM to produce 40,000 ventilators, “then all of a sudden\" it became 6,000. He said money also became an issue. “We didn’t want to play games with them,” he said.\n\nTrump complains about governors, says some 'aren't appreciative'\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has had disputes with a number of governors during the coronavirus crises, said during a White House briefing that the nation's governors \"have been great\" but said there are a \"couple who aren't appreciative.\"\n\n\"I want them to be appreciative. I don't want them to say things that aren't true,\" Trump said of governors who have criticized his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAsked which governors aren’t doing enough, Trump slammed Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, calling him “a failed presidential candidate.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “has no idea what’s going on, and all she does is say it’s the federal government’s fault,” he said.\n\n“The media has been pretty good, and the governors have been pretty good – except for a couple,” Trump said. “For them, it’s all political.\"\n\nTrump said he told Vice President Mike Pence not to bother talking to Inslee.\n\nWhitmer responded to Trump's comments on the governors, saying in a tweet she's \"willing to work with anyone as long as we get the personal protective equipment we need.\"\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump signs $2 trillion stimulus package\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package Friday that is intended to address the threat of economic disaster posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump signed the measure – the largest stimulus in U.S. history – in the Oval Office hours after it was approved by the House of Representatives, an unusually rapid approval that underscored dire warnings of a recession as companies began to lay off workers and U.S. consumers hunkered down in their homes to avoid spreading the virus.\n\n\"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said at the signing.\n\nHe reflected on how fast coronavirus changed life in the U.S. and the world.\n\n\"We got hit by the invisible enemy and we got hit hard,\" Trump said\n\nWhile the president’s signature ended the legislative effort on Capitol Hill, it marked a beginning to the government’s work managing the crisis. Now the Trump administration must rapidly pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of direct payments, loans and grants to hard-hit industries such as the airlines.\n\nThe stimulus package will provide $1,200 checks to many Americans – and more for families – while making available hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to maintain payroll through the crisis. It significantly expands the nation’s unemployment safety net and it directs a huge infusion of cash to hospitals and other medical facilities on the front line of fighting the pandemic.\n\nMarkets had rallied in recent days on the news that Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal on the stimulus, recovering some of the staggering losses of the past several weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained down Friday in midday trading.\n\nTrump said the economy would come roaring back.\n\n\"I think we are going to have a tremendous rebound,\" he said.\n\nDespite last-minute drama and some partisan squabbling about the details of the bill, Congress and the White House moved at stunning speed to shepherd the measure through the House and Senate. The pace reflected the pressure lawmakers have felt to address the economic consequences of a pandemic that has largely brought the nation’s industries and small businesses to a standstill.\n\nAs House leaders were rushing the Senate-approved legislation to the floor this week, the Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans filing initial unemployment claims jumped nearly twelvefold to a record 3.28 million last week.\n\nAmong the provisions in the package are $1,200 checks to qualifying individuals, $600 in additional weekly unemployment insurance payments, $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses, over $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers and direct financial help to airlines and other hard-hit industries.\n\n– John Fritze, Christal Hayes and David Jackson\n\nArmy Corps of Engineers: 114 US sites need hospitals\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers has identified 114 sites across the United States in need of hospitals to handle the crush of COVID-19 patients and expects the number of facilities to grow by as much as 30 per day, said Army Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nIn Chicago, the Corps is converting the sprawling McCormick Place Convention Center into a 3,000-bed hospital for COVID-19 patients at the cost of $75 million.\n\nArmy field hospitals have already been deployed to New York and Seattle. In New York, the Army Corps of Engineers is retrofitting the Javits Convention Center to house 2,900 non-COVID-19 patients.\n\nLouisiana, Michigan and Florida are anticipated to be hotspots for outbreaks in coming weeks. Florida’s aging population, particularly in Miami, Orlando and Tampa, is of particular concern, Semonite said.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nPelosi, Schumer not invited for coronavirus bill signing in Oval Office\n\nWASHINGTON – Democratic leaders who helped negotiate a historic $2 trillion coronavirus package were not invited to the White House for President Donald Trump’s ceremonial signing of the bill, while top Republicans flocked to the White House for the event.\n\nBoth House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were not invited to the White House for the event, their offices said.\n\nThe bill was the result of tedious bipartisan negotiations, and while members of both parties talked with the president and members of his administration throughout the process, Pelosi and Trump notably refrained from communicating at all.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was not present at the ceremony, either, though it’s unclear whether an invitation was extended to the New York Democrat. Schumer spoke with the president at least about the bill as it was being worked on in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appeared at the White House alongside the president as he signed the landmark legislation, which will offer financial help for Americans, businesses, corporations and hospitals.\n\nThe worsening virus had seemingly brought together Republicans and Democrats, forcing lawmakers to overcome deep-seated divisions in order to quickly get help to Americans and businesses reeling from the impact the virus has had on everyday life across the country.\n\nBut that doesn’t appeared to have extended to Pelosi and Trump, who have continued to bicker throughout the negotiations. The pair have not spoken since October when she upbraided him in a White House meeting over his Syria policy. They last saw one another last month at the president’s State of the Union address, where Trump refused to shake Pelosi’s hand and she ripped up his speech in an extraordinary public fashion.\n\nIn the past, the president has extended invites to some Democrats for such ceremonies but neglected to include them for others. No Democrats were at the White House when Trump signed off on his new trade deal for North America, something signed shortly after the House voted to impeach him from office.\n\n– Christal Hayes and John Fritze\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley tests negative for coronavirus\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said Friday that she has tested negative for the coronavirus.\n\n“I am relieved to report that I have tested negative for COVID-19. I am, however still recovering from the flu, but feeling much better and continuing to work remotely with my team on COVID-19 response,” Pressley said.\n\nShe had announced on Wednesday that she would be self-quarantining after experiencing flu-like symptoms, and was tested for COVID-19 out of an abundance of caution. “As an asthmatic and as someone who had been in contact with a colleague who tested positive for COVID-19, it was determined that I fell into a high risk category,” she said.\n\nPressley continued that she was “touched by the outpouring of support and concern for me and my family. My heart goes out to, and I continue to send prayers up for those battling this virus, and the surviving family members of those who have tragically already passed.”\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nDonald Trump puts up political ad touting his coronavirus response\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has accused critics of politicizing the coronavirus epidemic, is now sponsoring a campaign ad promoting his handling of the response.\n\n\"In times of struggle, we see the true greatness of the American character. Americans,\" Trump says in the online ad. \"From all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy!\"\n\nMany Democrats, including likely presidential nominee Joe Biden, have said Trump has been too slow in responding to the outbreak, and that states and cities remain without equipment to treat patients.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHouse approves $2 trillion coronavirus package\n\nWASHINGTON – The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.\n\nThe House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.\n\nThe vote comes one day after the U.S. reached two grim milestones, becoming the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world and reporting a record 3.28 million workers who applied for unemployment benefits in one week – the highest number in history since the Department of Labor started tracking data in 1967. The massive package aims to offer a financial lifeline to Americans and businesses that are hurting while also offering reassurance to the markets, which have been battered by fears that shutdowns related to the pandemic could throw the economy into a deep recession.\n\nSo far, COVID-19 has killed nearly 1,300 people in the U.S. and infected about 86,000. Efforts to mitigate its spread has left businesses closed and many Americans out of work.\n\nAmong the provisions in the measure are $1,200 checks to individuals, strengthened unemployment benefits that will offer workers an additional $600 weekly for four months, $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses, over $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers and financial help to airlines and other industries affected by the virus.\n\nThe measure was passed despite some last-minute drama that sent House lawmakers into a frantic rush to get back to D.C. over worries Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., would call for a recorded vote on the measure. Massie did request a recorded vote, which requires a majority of lawmakers be present at the Capitol, but it did not receive a second in order to enforce it.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nThird House member tests positive for coronavirus\n\nShortly after the House of Representatives passed a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., announced a positive test for the coronavirus.\n\n\"While I otherwise feel fine, since March 17th I have been unable to smell or taste, which I learned this week is a potential symptom of COVID-19,\" he said. Cunningham said he was tested on Thursday after a remote consultation with a physician and received a positive result today.\n\n\"While my symptoms have begun to improve, I will remain at home until I know it is safe to leave self-quarantine,\" Cunningham said in a statement, adding that he would continue to work remotely.\n\nCunningham said he had been in self-quarantine since March 19 after coming into contact with another member of Congress who tested positive.\n\nThe South Carolina Democrat is the third member of the House of Representatives to test positive for the coronavirus along with Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also tested positive.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump urges GM, Ford to make ventilators\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged automakers General Motors and Ford to begin manufacturing ventilators, critical medical equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients, and mentioned invoking the Defense Production Act to compel those companies to begin mass production.\n\n\"General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS NOW!!!!!!\" he tweeted. \"FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!\"\n\nThe president tweeted \"Invoke 'P'\" which he clarified in a later tweet meant the Defense Production Act, a wartime authority that allows him to direct companies to speed the production of medical equipment including ventilators, masks and other supplies to help health care workers treat coronavirus patients.\n\nWhile he mentioned his authority to invoke the DPA, Trump did not make clear whether he was going to use the act to compel the companies to make ventilators or whether he was just raising the threat to do so.\n\nTrump appeared to be responding to a New York Times report that found the White House stopped short of approving a $1 billion dollar deal with General Motors and Ventec Life Systems to produce up to 80,000 of the much-needed ventilators after government officials said they needed more time to weigh the price tag, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe president has faced mounting criticism from state and local officials for not formally enforcing the DPA to compel companies to expedite the production of medical supplies amid a widespread shortage of equipment across the country.\n\n\"As usual with 'this' General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, 'very quickly.' Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nHouse expected to have enough members to hold recorded vote on stimulus bill\n\nThe House is expected to have enough members present to vote on a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package Friday, according to a leadership aide.\n\nThat's important because frustrated House members rushed back to D.C. Friday so the House would have the majority present to hold a recorded vote that Rep. Thomas Massie plans to request.\n\nMassie, R-Ky., angered both parties, as well as President Donald Trump, by asking for the recorded vote, which requires at least a majority be present in the House to record their votes.\n\nThe House had planned to approve the measure by voice vote, meaning it would pass with present members calling out either \"aye\" or \"nay,” a method that did not require a majority. Leaders wanted lawmakers to stay home due to concerns that having them travel could further spread the virus within Congress. Already, two House lawmakers have tested positive for the virus and more than two dozen have gone into quarantine over the last several weeks.\n\nHouse Democrats and Republicans worked together throughout Friday to tally the votes to get to the magic number – 216 – to hold a recorded vote.\n\nMassie explained his rationale in a series of tweets.\n\n\"The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics, and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?”\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\n'Disaster for America': Trump lashes out at Massie\n\nPresident Donald Trump lashed out at Rep. Thomas Massie as a \"grandstander\" and \"disaster for America\" who should be thrown out of the GOP for the Kentucky Republican's opposition to a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package expected to pass in the House Friday.\n\n\"Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately a truly GREAT state, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress,\" Trump tweeted Friday morning.\n\n\"He just wants the publicity. He can't stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous...& costly,\" Trump added.\n\nThe president said it has been \"HELL\" working with Democrats to negotiate the bill, conceding that he \"had to give up some stupid things in order to get the 'big picture done.'\"\n\nAfter calling on the GOP to retake the House in November, Trump added, \"but throw Massie out of the Republican Party!\"\n\nIn a followup tweet, Trump said Massie was \"empowering the Radical Left Democrats\" and declared: \"He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\"\n\nMassie has also threatened to request lawmakers vote in person on the bill, forcing House lawmakers to rush back to Washington Friday in order to have enough lawmakers present to vote on the measure.\n\nThe House had planned to approve the package while keeping its hundreds of members home over concerns about further spreading the virus. Two House lawmakers have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nMembers were planning to use a voice vote in which those present in the House would call out either \"aye\" or 'nay.\" Such a method doesn't require a majority to be present. But if even just one member requests a recorded vote, which Massie has threatened to do, it would require more than half of House members to be present on the floor to cast votes in person on the measure.\n\nSeveral lawmakers lambasted Massie for forcing them back to Washington. But at least one, Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, defended Massie and told Trump to \"back off.\"\n\n\"@RepThomasMassie is one of the most principled men in Congress & loves his country. He is defending the Constitution today by requiring a quorum. There’s nothing 3rd rate about that,@realDonaldTrump,\" Roy tweeted. \"I may miss vote if he forces roll call (flights) but it will pass. Back off.\"\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nNYC lawmakers travel to DC to vote despite White House guidance\n\nSeveral members of Congress from New York City are traveling to Washington, D.C., Friday to vote on the coronavirus stimulus package despite White House guidance for New Yorkers to self-quarantine\n\nEarlier this week at a coronavirus task force press briefing, Dr. Deborah Birx advised people from New York to self-quarantine for 14 days after leaving the city to avoid spreading the virus.\n\nIn spite of this guidance, several members representing parts of New York City were spotted on the House floor or traveled to Washington to vote.\n\n\"I flew in this AM and most N.Y. members are here so no one really talking about it,\" Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., told USA TODAY in a text. Meng posted a photo from a mostly empty flight earlier in the morning as she flew in from her Queens-area district.\n\nStimulus check calculator:Calculate how much money you could get\n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who represents parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, gave a short speech on the House floor calling for the stimulus bill's package.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., whose district includes Brooklyn and Queens, posted a picture from his House office as he waited to vote.\n\nHouse leaders asked lawmakers to quickly return to Washington over fears an in-person vote would be needed to move the bill to President Donald Trump for final approval.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nHouse begins debate on coronavirus package\n\nThe House of Representatives began what could be up to three hours of debate on a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill Friday morning.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said they would be holding an \"unusual but critical session\" as the House members took their own steps to avoid the virus.\n\nMembers of the House were advised to keep at least six feet of distance from each other, and to sanitize their hands as they walked on and off of the House floor. Hand sanitizer dispensers were placed at the entrances of the House floor for members' use.\n\n\"No one will agree with every part of this rescue bill, but we face a challenge rarely seen in America's history. We must act now or the toll on lives and livelihoods will be far greater,\" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nFrustrated lawmakers rush back to D.C. to vote on coronavirus package\n\nFrustrated and angry House lawmakers are rushing back to Washington, taking red-eye flights and driving for hours after one member suggested he would require an in-person vote on a historic $2 trillion bill to help Americans and businesses reeling from the impacts of coronavirus.\n\nThe House plans to vote on the package by voice vote, meaning it would pass with members calling out either \"aye\" or \"nay,” but the procedure allows for any one lawmaker to ask for a recorded vote. If any lawmaker asks for one, it would require more than half of House members to be present on the House floor to cast votes in person on the legislation.\n\nThe House hoped to approve the package while keeping its hundreds of members home due to concerns about further spreading the virus. Already, two House lawmakers have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nTrump on N.Y. ventilator request:'I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.\"\n\nBut several lawmakers have voiced some opposition to the bill and allowing it to sail through without a full vote. One in particular, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has specifically threatened to ask for a recorded vote.\n\nThe threat caused leadership to ask that members quickly return to Washington, leading to a frantic rush to find flights or drive up to D.C. Several lawmakers took to Twitter and posted selfies from red-eye flights and their cars with some publicly airing their frustration and anger toward Massie.\n\n“We’re headed back to D.C. this morning to vote on the third coronavirus relief package. We know this has to get done as quickly as possible,” Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Penn., said in a Twitter video. “I’m really disappointed that there’s some members threatening to tank the bill on the floor, so we all got a call last night that we should head back as quickly as possible.”\n\nOne of Massie’s fellow Republicans was more blunt. Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., called it “disgraceful” and “irresponsible.”\n\n“Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,” he wrote on Twitter. “Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed.”\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nMichigan responds to Trump after Hannity interview\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer responded to President Donald Trump after the president seemed to forget the Democrat's name while discussing the coronavirus response.\n\nTrump couldn't recall Whitmer's name during an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on Thursday: \"We've had a big problem with the young, a woman governor from, you know who I'm talking about, from Michigan.\"\n\nTrump, who has also clashed with the governors of New York, Illinois, and Washington, among others, said Michigan's state executive is \"not stepping up. I don't know if she knows what's going on. But all she does is sit there and blame the federal government.\"\n\nWhitmer responded later Thursday.\n\n\"Hi, my name is Gretchen Whitmer, and that governor is me,\" Whitmer tweeted at the president. \"I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it.

We are working closely together. Much respect!\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nHouse expected to pass $2 trillion stimulus package\n\nThe House of Representatives is set to pass a massive $2 trillion stimulus package Friday to combat the coronavirus.\n\nThe measure will send direct payments to individuals and families, and aid businesses and industries.\n\nAs more lawmakers have self-quarantined and as three lawmakers have tested positive for the coronavirus, House Democratic and Republican leaders have said they want this legislation to pass by a voice vote, or an unrecorded vote normally reserved for uncontroversial matters like minting commemorative coins or making technical corrections to laws.\n\n\"Our Members want to come back in order to have the debate, and we expect to have a voice vote on it,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. \"But if we don't, we'll be prepared for whatever it is.\"\n\nHouse members have been advised to keep 6 feet between themselves and staff in their offies and the Capitol, and access to the floor of the House is being limited.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has threatened to oppose a voice vote, which would delay proceedings by forcing lawmakers to hold a recorded vote.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate by a 96-0 vote on Wednesday night following days of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over final provisions. Democrats had asked for more stringent oversight over the funds disbursed to industries affected by the outbreak.\n\nThe House is set to reconvene at 9:00 a.m. EDT.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump questions NY ask for 30,000 ventilators\n\nWhile pledging cooperation with governors to fight the coronavirus, President Donald Trump is questioning some of their requests for tens of thousands of ventilators needed to treat an expected flood of patients in the coming weeks.\n\n\"I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday. \"You know, you go into major hospitals, sometimes, they’ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying, 'can we order 30,000 ventilators?'\"\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he needs 30,000 ventilators \"at a minimum\" to meet the peak of the outbreak in his state in a couple of weeks. Cuomo also said the federal government has been slow to help provide help.\n\n“The president said it’s a war – it is a war,\" Cuomo said. \"Well, then, act like it’s a war!”\n\nCiting Cuomo's request, Trump told Hannity: \"Thirty thousand? All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital.

Liz Cheney, the House Republican Conference chair from Wyoming, is in hot water with her party. Her refusal to accept former President Donald Trump's false claims the 2020 election was stolen is angering her Republican colleagues and putting her leadership role at risk.\n\nMajor party leaders are dissatisfied with her. Trump and No. 2 House Republican Rep. Steve Scalise want her replaced with Rep. Elise Stefanik, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said House Republicans told him they're worried about her \"ability to carry out the job.\"\n\nIf Cheney loses her position as the third-ranking House Republican, it would cause more than just a major shakeup in GOP congressional leadership – it would further signal the party’s interest in keeping Trump and his wing of the GOP front and center as they try to flip Democratic control of Congress and push against President Joe Biden.\n\nCheney herself cast it in more stark terms, writing a blistering Washington Post editorial Wednesday in which she framed the Republican Party as \"at a turning point\" in whether it will choose \"truth and fidelity to the Constitution\" or the \"cult of personality\" of Trump.\n\nLiz Cheney:Trump, No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise throw support behind Elise Stefanik for Liz Cheney's leadership post\n\nThe Republican caucus was expected to meet Wednesday behind closed doors, though Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine said no formal vote or discussion on Cheney's future has been announced.\n\nBut the wave of criticism has drawn out support for Stefanik, a pro-Trump Republican who gained wide recognition over her staunch support of the former president during his first impeachment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Scalise became the first in Republican leadership to publicly call for Cheney’s removal and endorse Stefanik to replace her. Trump endorsed Stefanik as well in a statement Wednesday.\n\nCheney has repeatedly said the Republican Party needs to move on from its association with Trump, but the pushback she faces means the party isn’t ready to do that, said Bryan Gervais, associate professor of political science at the University of Texas at San Antonio and author of “Reactionary Republicanism: How the Tea Party in the House Paved the Way for Trump’s Victory.” The pressure to replace Cheney is some of the strongest evidence yet of Trump’s hold on congressional Republicans, he said.\n\n\"I was always skeptical that the party would quickly try to break away from Trump and his image, and this is sort of what we’re seeing right now,\" Gervais said. \"For the time being, it’s still Trump’s party, and Republican elites have made the call that sticking close to Trump is the best bet for retaking Congress.\"\n\nCheney is one of 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump the second time after he was accused of inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Since then, she has repeatedly pushed back on “the big lie” that widespread election fraud was the cause of Trump's election loss.\n\n“The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system,” Cheney tweeted this week in response to a Trump statement in which he again said the election was “fraudulent.”\n\nElection integrity is now a \"cover for the 'stop the steal' movement\" that Republicans will look to as a midterm election issue, according to former Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., chief strategist for the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks and exposes misinformation on social media.\n\nWho is Liz Cheney? House Republicans' No. 3, daughter of a VP, Trump critic\n\nThe 2022 midterms are expected to be a massive test of whether Trump's sway translates to electoral wins. Democrats hold just slight advantages in the House and Senate, and Republicans are pushing to win them back to counter Biden's agenda.\n\nRiggleman said Republican leaders have solidified their 2022 messaging, and it will likely align with Trump's main messages: election integrity, Second Amendment preservation \"and some sort of anti-everything the Democrats are doing.\"\n\n\"The Trump part of the party believes that the fundraising is much more effective by supporting Trump than not ... that culture wars are much more effective for the Republican base than actual policy discussions,\" Riggleman said.\n\nCheney in her editorial pointed out Trump's influence on those seeking reelection.\n\n\"While embracing or ignoring Trump’s statements might seem attractive to some for fundraising and political purposes, that approach will do profound long-term damage to our party and our country,\" she wrote.\n\nCheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has long resisted calls to resign from colleagues such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who has remained in Trump’s corner and rallied against Cheney in Wyoming. After the impeachment vote and being censured by her state’s party, Cheney said she was not going anywhere.\n\nMore:Liz Cheney persists in pushing back on Trump's election claims despite perilous position in GOP\n\nIn February, Cheney survived an attempt to strip her of her leadership title and was backed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said three months ago that she was an \"important leader\" and had the \"courage\" to act on her convictions. McConnell dodged questions about Cheney on Wednesday.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has taken a different approach. This week he said on Fox News that there were concerns from Republican lawmakers about Cheney's ability to do her job, and he was caught on a hot mic saying he’s “had it” with Cheney, according to Axios and CNN.\n\nGervais said McCarthy recognizes that pushing Cheney out and sticking with the Trump faction of the party is necessary to stay in power.\n\n\"He has a survival instinct that hits all the right buttons,\" Gervais said. “He’s long had the instinct to foster and cater to the more reactionary and extreme elements in his caucus while still maintaining an image that he is not a full-fledged member of that faction.”\n\nDemocrats have praised Cheney and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, another of Trump’s detractors, for calling out election fraud claims pushed by Trump and his supporters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office said McCarthy is “punishing members who tell the truth” and “rewarding members who spread the big lie.”\n\nBiden acknowledged the rift among Republicans on Wednesday, saying \"I don't understand the Republicans\" when asked about the effort to oust Cheney.\n\n'Liz Cheney refuses to lie':GOP Sen. Mitt Romney defends Rep. Liz Cheney amid Republican blowback\n\n“They’re in the midst of a significant, sort of mini-revolution going on,” he said. “I've been a Democrat for a long time. We've gone through periods where we've had internal fights and disagreements. I don't remember any like this.\"\n\nCheney also got flak from Republicans over her friendly fist-bump greeting to Biden during his first address to a joint session of Congress last week. She said that while she does not support the Biden administration’s policies, “we’re not sworn enemies.”\n\nShe has doubled down on her opposition to “the big lie” in recent days even as top Republicans have continued to abandon their support for her.\n\n\"I think Liz is probably in very good spirits right now. ... This is a long-term struggle to bring rationality and facts back to the party,\" Riggleman said. \"People like myself and others don’t look at this as a career, we look at this as service, and we’re not willing to do anything to get elected.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/07"}]}

Wade: Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn ...", "text": "(CNN) In a stunning breach of Supreme Court confidentiality and secrecy, Politico has obtained what it calls a draft of a majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would strike down Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe draft was circulated in early February, according to Politico. The final opinion has not been released and votes and language can change before opinions are formally released. The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.\n\nThe court confirmed the authenticity of the document Tuesday. It also stressed it was not the final decision.\n\nAccording to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion. The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women's reproductive health in America.\n\nIt appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.\n\nThat would mean that the five conservative justices that would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas , Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nJUST WATCHED Coates describes potential socioeconomic impact if Roe v.

Under current law, government cannot interfere with a women's choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.\n\n\"This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,\" Roberts said. I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.\"\n\n\"To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,\" Roberts said. \"The work of the Court will not be affected in any way. We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce -- permanent employees and law clerks alike -- intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court.\"\n\nAfter the draft was published, a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building Monday evening, as people came together to console one another and question what to do next.\n\nAt one point, the crowd began to chant, \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Samuel Alito's gotta go.\" \"We will not go back.\" \"Abortion rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back.\" \"Pack the courts.\"\n\nPolitico's publishing of the draft is unprecedented by the high court's standards of secrecy. The inner deliberations among the justices while opinions are being drafted and votes are being settled are among the most closely held details in Washington.\n\n\"This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"Not only is the result it portends -- the overruling of Roe and Casey -- a shockwave to our constitutional politics, but we have never seen a leak remotely like this from inside the Court, where we're not just hearing what the result is going to be, but we're seeing the draft majority opinion in advance. It's hard to believe that the former doesn't help to explain the latter, but it's an earthquake in both respects.\"\n\nThe case in question is Dobbs v. Jackson. It concerns a challenge to Mississippi's 15-week ban on abortion and oral arguments were heard on December 1. The release of a final opinion in the case is expected later this Spring or early summer.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito writes that Roe \"must be overruled.\"\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,\" Alito wrote. He said that Roe was \"egregiously wrong from the start\" and that its reasoning was \"exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\"\n\nHe added, \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's representatives.\"\n\n\"That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand,\" he said, according to the draft.\n\nAlready nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion, while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\nProcess of voting\n\nOral arguments in the case were held on December 1.\n\nUnder normal procedure, by the end of that week the justices would have met in their private conference to take a preliminary vote on the issue. They would have gone around the table in order of seniority discussing their take on the case. Roberts would have gone first, with Barrett last.\n\nAfter that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion. Otherwise the most senior justice would have taken that responsibility. After that, draft opinions would go between chambers. In the past, justices have changed their votes and sometimes a majority opinion ultimately becomes a dissent.\n\nA reversal of Roe would leave abortion policy up to individual states and would likely produce a patchwork system where the procedure would remain largely available in Democratic-led states, while Republican-led states would pass extreme limits or outright bans on it.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Unbelievable shift': Klobuchar reacts to draft Supreme Court opinion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Unbelievable shift': Klobuchar reacts to draft Supreme Court opinion 02:38\n\nThe Dobbs case was perhaps the most anticipated case of the court's term, and most court observers expected that the conservative majority was likely to scale back or outright overturn Roe's holding. At oral arguments, Roberts was the only one of the six Republican appointees who signaled interest in exploring a narrower opinion that would have upheld Mississippi's law but preserved some protections for abortion rights.\n\nBecause it is one of the court's most high-stakes and contentious decisions, the anticipation was that the opinion would be among the final ones the court released at the end of its term in late June.\n\nRoe is the law of the land until the court formally issues its opinion.\n\n\"Let's be clear: This is a draft opinion. It's outrageous, it's unprecedented, but it's not final. Abortion is your right -- and it is STILL LEGAL,\" Planned Parenthood said in a tweet following Politico's reporting.\n\nDecades-long project of conservative legal moment\n\nOverturning Roe would be the culmination of a decades-long project of the conservative legal moment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe \"automatically.\" His nominee Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sided with the liberal justices in past abortion rights cases. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Democratic appointee and abortion rights champion who died weeks before the 2020 election.\n\nCelebrated by supporters of abortion right and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability, which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey . A majority of the court in that case replaced Roe's framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an \"undue burden\" on the right to abortion, which is defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\"\n\nAccording to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in January , most Americans oppose overturning Roe, with a majority saying that if the decision was vacated, they'd want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws.\n\nJust 30% of Americans say they'd like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe vs. Wade decision, with 69% opposed -- a finding that's largely consistent both with other recent polling and with historical trends.\n\nStare decisis and overturning precedent\n\nIn the opinion, Alito also addresses the fact that Roe has been on the books for some 50 years. Although the court is loath to overturn precedent, Alito says it must do so. He said that the notion of \"stare decisis\" does not \"compel unending adherence to Roe's abuse of judicial authority.\"\n\nHe said that instead of \"bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue\" Roe and a follow-on decision \"have enflamed debate and deepened division.\"\n\n\"The inescapable conclusion,\" Alito wrote, according to the draft, \"is that a right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions.\"\n\nHe also said the decision was on a \"collision course\" with the Constitution \"from the day it was decided.\"\n\nAlito also pushed back on the notion that if the court were to overturn Roe it could lead the court to overturn other cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, that upheld the right to same-sex marriage. He said that what \"sharply distinguishes\" Roe from other cases is that \"abortion destroys\" potential life.\n\nJUST WATCHED Coates describes potential socioeconomic impact if Roe v.

As of April 2022, 536 abortion restrictions have been introduced in 42 states.\n\nDemocrats outraged, call to end filibuster\n\nPresident Joe Biden said a woman's right to have an abortion is \"fundamental\" in his first statement on the issue Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nSeveral Senate Democratic candidates immediately called for the elimination of the filibuster and passing legislation to protect abortion rights.\n\n\"Democrats need to act NOW—end the filibuster, codify Roe, and defend reproductive freedom,\" tweeted Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski , who's running for her party's nomination for Senate.\"This fight is too urgent.\"\n\n\"Control of the Senate has never been more important: it's time to end the filibuster, pass the Women's Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington,\" added Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who's favored to win his Democratic primary on Tuesday.\n\nThe push from the Democratic candidates and others is likely to fail, unless some incumbent senators change their minds. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats need every vote to eliminate the chamber's rules requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation. And Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have repeatedly committed to protecting the filibuster, which sets up a 60-vote threshold that requires bipartisan cooperation to pass most legislation.\n\nIn February, Manchin also joined Senate Republicans in blocking the House-passed Women's Health Protection Act that aimed to preserve access to abortion.\n\nIn a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said overturning Roe would be \"the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years -- not just on women but on all Americans.\"\n\n\"Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court's reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/dobbs-mississippi-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) The Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\n\"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion. \"Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.\"\n\nThe vote was 5-4 in favor of overturning Roe. In a joint dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan heavily criticized the majority, closing: \"With sorrow -- for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection -- we dissent.\"\n\nThe opinion represents the culmination of a decades-long effort on the part of critics of abortion seeking to return more power to the states. It was made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority -- including three of Donald Trump's nominees.\n\nAt least 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute , which favors abortion rights. And an additional four states are likely to ban abortions as soon as possible without federal protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, writing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only uphold Mississippi's law banning abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nBiden: Ruling casts a 'dark shadow'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday \"the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk\" after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n\"It's a sad day for the court and for the country,\" Biden said, speaking from the White House , calling for Congress to codify the right to an abortion -- something that's unlikely given the split balance of power in the Senate.\n\n\"It was three justices named by one president, Donald Trump, who were the core of today's decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country.

Wade has been consigned to the ash heap of history, a new arena in the cause of life has emerged, and it is incumbent on all who cherish the sanctity of life to resolve that we will take the defense of the unborn and the support for women in crisis pregnancy centers to every state in America,\" Pence added.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, said she objected to the decision.\n\n\"This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.\n\nTrigger bans mean abortion is prohibited in several states\n\nIn at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nThree states -- Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota -- have so-called \"trigger bans\" that went into effect automatically upon the Supreme Court's ruling. Ten other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.\n\nAmong the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday that he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.\n\nIt's likely that elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.\n\nSimilar to leaked draft\n\nThe final opinion was strikingly similar to the draft written by Alito that was leaked earlier this year. It repeats his scornful language towards the original Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined abortion rights.\n\nLike the draft opinion, Alito included a list of cases that also rested on a right to privacy, as Alito asserted that Roe was distinct from those cases.\n\n\"What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call 'potential life' and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an 'unborn human being,'\" Alito wrote, in a line that was also present in the draft.\n\nWhat's new is Alito's response to the dissent, jointly written by the three liberal justices. The dissent would not have been written at the time that the leaked draft was circulated around the court.\n\n\"The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a 'deeply rooted' one, 'in this Nation's history and tradition.'\" Alito wrote. \"The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right -- no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise.\"\n\nIn that four-page section, Alito said that the dissent's failure \"engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position.\"\n\nDissent points to potential impact on women\n\nThe dissenters said women's rights are under attack.\n\n\"Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today's decision is certain: the curtailment of women's rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.\"\n\nFriday's opinion, the dissent said, \"says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.\"\n\n\"Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child,\" the liberal justices added.\n\nThe dissent also stressed how the decision will impact poor women who now will have to travel in order to obtain the procedure. \"Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today's decision.\"\n\nThe dissent also lashed out at Justice Brett Kavanaugh for suggesting that the decision simply returns the abortion question to the states.\n\nAs the three liberal Justices wrote, \"no language in today's decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens,\" they explained, throwing Kavanaugh's words back at him, \"'the views of [an individual State's] citizens' will not matter. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to 'New York [or] California' but to Toronto.\"\n\nChallenge brought by Mississippi\n\nChampioned by supporters of abortion and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nA majority of the court in that case replaced Roe's framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an \"undue burden\" on the right to abortion which is defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\"\n\nBefore the court was Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018 but blocked by two federal courts, which allows abortion after 15 weeks \"only in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality\" and has no exception for rape or incest. A district court blocked the law, holding that it is in direct violation of Supreme Court precedent legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nA panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court holding that in an \"unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's abortion cases have established (and affirmed and re-affirmed) a woman's right to choose an abortion before viability.\" The court said states may \"regulate abortion procedures prior to viability\" so long as they do not ban abortion. \"The law at issue is a ban,\" the court held.\n\nMississippi appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and after the justices agreed to hear the case, the state raised the stakes and argued that the justices should not only uphold the law but also invalidate Roe and Casey.\n\nMississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart was blunt at oral arguments.\n\n\"Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey haunt our country,\" Stewart said. \"They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They've damaged the democratic process. They poison the law. They've choked off compromise. For 50 years they've kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve and 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.\"\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued on behalf of the Biden administration in support of the clinics. She urged the justices to uphold precedent and avoid a ruling that would disproportionally harm women who have come to depend upon the decision.\n\n\"For a half century, this Court has correctly recognized that the Constitution protects a woman's fundamental right to decide whether to end a pregnancy before viability,\" she argued. \"That guarantee, that the state cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, has engendered substantial individual and societal reliance. The real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.\"\n\nShe added: \"The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society.\n\nJulie Rikelman, a lawyer for Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi and Sacheen Carr-Ellis, the clinic's medical director, told the justices that Mississippi's ban on abortion \"two months before viability\" is \"flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent.\"\n\nPublic opposed to overturning Roe\n\nA broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned , polling taken before the Supreme Court's decision shows.\n\nIn a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the draft opinion, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its decision. In CNN's polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.\n\nIn the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they'd want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they'd like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn't get them where they lived.\n\nBut not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturn of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they live.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Chandelis Duster", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/five-things-august-5-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Aug. 5: Economy, Brittney Griner, Breonna ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The Inflation Reduction Act is much slimmer than President Joe Biden's initial Build Back Better bill, but it would still represent the largest investment in energy and climate programs in US history. It would also extend expiring health care subsidies for three years and give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices. New taxes would help pay for it all.

It will also have to be reviewed by the Senate parliamentarian, who will decide whether the bill is eligible for the filibuster-proof budget process that will allow Democrats to pass it along party lines.\n\n2. Brittney Griner\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years of jail time by a Russian court after being convicted on Thursday of deliberately smuggling drugs into the country. The case has raised concerns that Griner is being used as a pawn in Russia's war with Ukraine. President Biden called the sentence \"unacceptable\" and said his administration would work to secure Griner's release. Now, Russia has indicated it is ready to discuss a prisoner swap for Griner and another American, Paul Whelan, who has been wrongfully detained in Russia since 2018. There has already been movement in the negotiation process, but that could accelerate in the coming days now that Griner has been sentenced. Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport six months ago and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage.\n\nJUST WATCHED See Brittney Griner's reaction as sentence is read Replay More Videos ...

Wade is overturned? What we know about ...", "text": "A draft opinion by the Supreme Court leaked Monday night, showing the high court may overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nThe leak itself, made public by Politico, is highly unusual: While court deliberations have leaked before, including during President Richard Nixon's administration, the release of a draft opinion is virtually unprecedented.\n\nThe draft was reportedly circulated in February, about two months after oral arguments concluded in a challenge to Mississippi's 2018 law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The outlet reported a majority of justices supported the draft opinion.\n\n\"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the draft. \"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday verified the leak was authentic but pushed back on the notion that it represented the final decision of the court. Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement that he'd launched an investigation into the leak\n\n“To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the court was to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,” Roberts said. “The work of the court will not be affected in any way.”\n\nSupreme Court deliberations are supposed to be secret.So how did a draft abortion opinion leak?\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nIs abortion illegal now?\n\nNo, this is the leak of a possible draft ruling. The Supreme Court was expected to release a decision in this specific case in about two months. But abortion-rights activists have been warning the court was leaning in this direction. That's in large part why the reporting by Politico is being taken so seriously.\n\nElizabeth Sepper, a University of Texas law professor who studies health law, said the leak could be posturing by one side or another, tempering expectations or floating a trial balloon. Still, she said the highly unusual leak is reverberating across the country.\n\n“I think the draft is a wakeup call. The end of abortion access for many Americans is not hypothetical. A majority of the Supreme Court has cast their votes against a longstanding constitutional right to autonomy and self determination,” she said.\n\nReport:Leaked draft Supreme Court opinion suggests majority may overturn Roe v. Wade\n\nWhat is Roe v. Wade?\n\nThe Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision is credited with legalizing abortion nationwide.\n\nIn 1969, a pregnant woman under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\" challenged the constitutionality of Texas abortion laws forbidding abortions in most cases. By a vote of seven to two, the Supreme Court ruled in her favor in the case, called Roe v. Wade, finding that laws criminalizing abortions violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision struck down many state abortion laws during a time when abortions under many circumstances were banned in most states.\n\nROE V. WADE EXPLAINER:What is Roe v. Wade and how could the Texas abortion law affect it?\n\nWhat does overturn mean? What does codify mean?\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sets precedents, meaning they typically follow previous decisions in which they resolved conflicting interpretations of the law. But sometimes, courts choose to overturn precedent, rejecting a prior interpretation of the law in favor of a new one.\n\nTo codify something is to make it a code of law. Codifying Roe v. Wade means passing either a state of federal law that would affirm abortion rights. After news broke of the leaked Supreme Court draft decision, President Joe Biden called on Congress to pass legislation to codify abortion rights.\n\n\"We will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law,\" he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he would hold a Senate vote on legislation to enshrine abortion rights, though the future of such a bill is entirely uncertain in the closely divided chamber.\n\n\"This is as urgent and real as it gets,\" he said. \"Every American is going to see on which side every senator stands.\"\n\nCan Biden, Congress protect abortion rights? What is a filibuster?\n\nWhile Biden and Democratic vowed to use legislation to codify abortion rights, the Senate's filibuster remains an obstacle.\n\nIn effect, filibuster rules require 60 votes to end debate on legislation and move to a vote. Currently, the Senate is evenly divided 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tie breaking vote.\n\nAs a result, many progressives are calling on the Senate to eliminate the filibuster rules.\n\nBiden did not say Tuesday when asked whether he would support eliminating the filibuster to try to codify Roe. v. Wade, but White House press secretary Jen Psaki said regardless the votes in the evenly divided Senate to codify Roe. v. Wade aren't there, making any calls to eliminate the filibuster to pass abortion-rights legislation misguided.\n\nShe pointed to the Senate's 46-48 vote in March to defeat the Women’s Health Protection Act, which also sought to protect abortion rights, as an example.\n\n“I think it's important to note that there has been a vote on this. It failed,” Psaki said. “It did not have even 50 votes, which means even if the filibuster were overturned, there would have not been enough votes to get this passed.\"\n\nInstead, Democratic leaders have pointed to the November elections, hoping the issue will energize voters to elect “more pro-choice officials,\" Psaki said.\n\nWhat will happen if Roe v. Wade is overturned? What states will ban abortion?\n\nIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, states would be free to make abortion illegal. Nearly half of U.S. states already have laws in place that would take effect immediately upon a Supreme Court ruling. Another 16 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws explicitly protecting abortion rights if Roe v. Wade is ever overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and policy organization.\n\n\"This is going to be an unprecedented earthquake in American life,\" said Amelia Bonow, founder of the Seattle-based national abortion access group Shout Your Abortion.\n\nWho is Samuel Alito? Who are the other Supreme Court judges?\n\nSamuel Alito was nominated to the Supreme Court by Former President George W. Bush in 2005. Since then, he has been a consistent conservative voice on the court and one the the court's most outspoken proponents of religious freedom.\n\nThe other current members of the U.S. Supreme Court include John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Roberts, a member of the court's conservative wing, serves as chief justice after being nominated by Bush in 2005.\n\nWHO IS SAMUEL A. ALITO?:What to know about the Bush-nominated Supreme Court justice\n\nHas the Supreme Court ever overruled past decisions?\n\nUsually, the Supreme Court doesn't revisit decisions, according to the principle known as \"stare decisis,\" a Latin phrase for \"to stand by things decided.\" In other words, the Supreme Court tends not to overrule past decisions, even if the composition of the court has changed.\n\nBut that's not a binding requirement, and the court has changed rulings, though rarely.\n\nOne of the most well-known rulings where the court reversed itself was the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which struck down a 1896 ruling legalizing segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nConservatives have long targeted Roe to be overturned, and former President Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices to the bench — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — after promising to select candidates based in part on their willingness to revisit the decision.\n\nWhat did Roe v. Wade actually say?The landmark abortion rights ruling, explained\n\nWho would abortion bans in the US affect the most?\n\nAbortion-rights activists say banning the procedures will hurt people of color the hardest. People of color have the highest rate of getting abortions in the nation, so these Americans will likely have the hardest time with unwanted pregnancies or will be forced to raise children they cannot afford or didn't want.\n\nAdvocates also say abortion bans will harm poor Americans disproportionally because they will be less able to travel to states where abortion remains legal. Advocates have raised concern that some may instead turn to illegal abortions close to home, raising the risk of death for a pregnant person.\n\nDr. Stella Safo, a New York-based primary care physician and founder of Just Equity for Health, a company focused on equitable health care, called the drafted decision \"maddening.\"\n\n\"It won't stop people from getting abortions — it will stop people from getting safe abortions,” she said. “All the people who are minoritized historically in this country, and who are poor — it’s low-income women who are going to suffer the most from this and it's absolutely maddening.\"\n\nROE V WADE:Leaked abortion opinion by Supreme Court adds more fuel to already raging fire of debate\n\nWhat happens next on the Supreme Court abortion decision?\n\nWe wait. The court is expected to rule on this specific case in about two months. It's possible the court could rule differently than what the draft opinion says.\n\nIn a statement, the anti-abortion rights group National Right to Life said it was waiting for the actual decision: \"In response to the Politico article claiming to have a copy of the initial draft of the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, National Right to Life agrees with the statement of Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch who said, 'We will let the Supreme Court speak for itself and wait for the Court’s official opinion.'\"\n\nAbortion-rights groups have been gearing up for this fight for months and have vowed not to let state bans block access to abortions. They have been strengthening networks that help low-income people seeking abortions travel to states where it remains legal as well as providing access to abortion pills to induce medical abortions.\n\nWhat does this mean for future civil rights cases?\n\nLegal experts say the reasoning in this draft decision could lead the Supreme Court to overturn other civil rights protections, including gay marriage, and let states decide.\n\nDavid Lane, a Denver-based civil rights attorney, said the draft decision could prompt the creation of a new \"Underground Railroad\" where people have to travel across state lines to exercise civil rights they once enjoyed nationally.\n\n\"There are innumerable earthshaking events that could flow from this,\" Lane said. \"The damage that this could to do American civil liberties is incalculable.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Dylan Wells, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/05/20/abortion-access-pivotal-states-after-roe/9731528002/", "title": "What's next?

Wade, traditionally conservative Kansas, given the chance to directly respond at the ballot box, denied their own elected leaders' the chance to revoke a right that has broad support across swaths of independent polling.\n\nThe rejection of the measure highlighted the increasingly stark divide between the activities of Republican state lawmakers, often in legislatures gerrymandered to effectively guarantee GOP control, and the political and policy desires of American voters. In more immediate terms, the ballot measure's defeat -- on a day of extraordinary turnout -- also provides a clear indication that the desire to defend abortion rights could be a potent issue for Democrats in the coming midterm elections.\n\nThe polling, from a variety of sources, is unambiguous and consistent. Across party lines, abortion rights are popular and the Supreme Court's ruling is not. The most recent CNN poll found that 63% of Americans disapproved -- 51% \"strongly\" -- of the court's decision. The Kaiser Family Foundation came to a similar conclusion, with 61% of respondents to their survey saying they wanted their state to guarantee access to abortion. Only 25% wanted them to restrict it.\n\nThe backlash, and its translation to concrete political terms, could potentially influence elections in a handful of states this fall -- including in liberal states like California and Vermont, where the big ticket results are close to a formality but the energy of Democrats could tip races down the ballot.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Analysis Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/kansas-constitutional-amendment-abortion/index.html", "title": "Kansas set to become first state to let voters weigh in on abortion in ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) Kansas on Tuesday will become the first state in the nation to let voters weigh in on abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

Thursday's ruling \"severely burdens States' efforts\" to curb gun violence, Breyer wrote.\n\n\"The primary difference between the Court's view and mine is that I believe the Amendment allows States to take account of the serious problems posed by gun violence that I have just described,\" Breyer wrote. \"I fear that the Court's interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves States without the ability to address them.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, in a concurring opinion, pushed back: \"And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.\"\n\nThe conservative justices also dismissed concerns defenders of New York's gun law raised about how the law restricted the carrying of firearms into sensitive places.\n\n\"It is true that people sometimes congregate in 'sensitive places,' and it is likewise true that law enforcement professionals are usually presumptively available in those locations. But expanding the category of 'sensitive places' simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of 'sensitive places' far too broadly,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nFirst major ruling on guns in a decade\n\nSince handing down two major Second Amendment cases in 2008 and 2010, the court has largely dodged the issue but agreed to take up the dispute after Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived, highlighting her impact on the new conservative court.\n\nIn 2008's District of Columbia v. Heller, the court held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms at home for self-defense. Except for a follow-up decision two years later, the justices largely stayed away from the issue infuriating gun rights advocates and even some of the justices themselves.\n\nThomas and other conservatives have made clear they believe lower courts have been thumbing their noses at the Heller decision by upholding restrictions. \"The Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court,\" Thomas has previously said.\n\nThe case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, concerned a New York law governing licenses to carry concealed handguns in public for self-defense. It required a resident to obtain a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver and demonstrate that \"proper cause\" exists for the permit. Residents must show that they have a great need for the license and that they face a \"special or unique danger to their life.\"\n\nThe law requires applicants who want to carry a handgun in public without restriction to show an \"actual and articulable\" self-defense need, as opposed to one that is \"speculative or specious.\"\n\nA panel of judges on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals held that New York's law did not violate the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Biden administration supported New York and told the Supreme Court in a brief that while the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms, the right is \"not absolute.\"\n\nActing Solicitor General Brian Fletcher told the justices that the law was \"firmly grounded\" in the nation's history.\n\nThe petitioners in the case were Robert Nash, Brandon Koch and the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association -- an NRA affiliate. They were represented by Paul Clement, a George W. Bush-era solicitor general who argued that that the Second Amendment ensures a right not just to \"keep arms,\" but to bear them.\n\nNash and Koch had passed the required background checks and obtained licenses to carry guns for hunting and target practice, but they had not been able to establish a special need for self-defense that is required under the law to receive an unrestricted license.\n\nClement argued that the law makes it almost impossible for an ordinary individual to obtain a license because the \"proper cause\" standard is so demanding and left to the \"broad discretion\" of the licensing officer.\n\n\"Good, even impeccable, moral character plus a simple desire to exercise a fundamental right is,\" Clement said, \"not sufficient.\" \"Nor is living or being employed in a high crime area.\"\n\nNash, for instance, requested to carry a handgun for self-defense after a string of robberies in his neighborhood. But he was denied because he did not demonstrate a special need for self-defense. Koch wanted a similar license, and he was able to cite his experience of participating in safety training courses. He too was denied.\n\nReaction\n\nGun rights groups touted the ruling as a win for Second Amendment rights and individuals' rights to protect themselves, while gun safety advocates argued that the ruling would result in more gun violence.\n\nSeveral New York Democrats decried the ruling, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who called the court's decision \"shocking\" and \"frightful in its scope of how they are setting back this nation and our ability to protect our citizens.\"\n\n\"Today the Supreme Court is sending us backwards in our efforts to protect families and prevent gun violence. And it's particularly painful that this came down at this moment, when we're still dealing with families in pain from mass shootings that have occurred -- the loss of life, their beloved children and grandchildren,\" Hochul told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe governor said she's prepared to call the state legislature back into session in response to the ruling. She said state legislators have already been alerted and that they're looking at possible dates for reconvening.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, said the decision on guns, \"put simply,\" will put New Yorkers \"at further risk of gun violence\" in a statement vowing specific action to mitigate the risks he says the decision will create.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said the ruling, \"severely undermines public safety not just in New York City, but around the country.\" Bragg says his office is \"analyzing\" the ruling and crafting gun safety legislation that will take steps to \"mitigate the damage done today.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association, meanwhile, called the Supreme Court ruling a \"watershed win.\"\n\n\"Today's ruling is a watershed win for good men and women all across America and is the result of a decades-long fight the NRA has led,\" NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said in a statement. \"The right to self-defense and to defend your family and loved ones should not end at your home.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and reaction.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-michigan-ballot-initiative/7722914001/", "title": "Michigan ballot initiative seeks to guarantee abortion rights after ...", "text": "Organizers of a ballot initiative to enshrine the right to an abortion in Michigan's Constitution said they were on track to put the measure before voters this November after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday overturned the court's 1973 ruling guaranteeing abortion rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"In Michigan, abortion remains legal for now,\" said Loren Khogali, the executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan, referring to an order issued by a Michigan judge in May temporarily blocking the enforcement of a 1931 state law on the books banning abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. The state law includes an exception for abortions \"necessary to preserve the life of (any pregnant woman).\"\n\n\"Amending the state constitution would provide the most enduring protection to abortion and to reproductive freedom,\" Khogali said during a news briefing Friday held by organizers of the effort. The ACLU of Michigan has partnered with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan and the nonprofit Michigan Voices to put the Reproductive Freedom for All constitutional amendment on the November ballot.\n\n\"These next couple weeks are critical,\" Khogali said. Organizers of the ballot initiative must collect at least 425,059 signatures from Michigan voters by July 11.\n\nSommer Foster, the co-executive director of Michigan Voices, said her organization has been handing out petitions all day to first-time volunteers to collect signatures for the ballot measure and is expecting more to sign up. The group has already seen 30,000 people raise their hands to get involved with the campaign, which expects to meet the filing deadline, Foster said.\n\n\"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,\" she said. \"The (U.S.) Supreme Court has made clear that is it up to us to come together to protect reproductive freedom.\"\n\nMore:Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion questions for millions in Michigan\n\nMore:Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade in 6-3 decision, returns abortion question to states\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision to reverse the landmark Roe v. Wade case protecting a national right to abortion, now leaves that right in the hands of individual states.\n\n\"Our worst fears have become a reality today,\" said Nicole Wells Stallworth, executive director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan. \"But we are here today to say that we are fighting back and we are going to do everything we possibly can to block abortion bans from irreparably harming Michiganders.\"\n\nFor decades, Roe nullified Michigan's long-dormant state ban on abortion. Foster called the May ruling from a Michigan Court of Claims judge temporarily blocking enforcement of that ban in response to a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood of Michigan a \"saving grace for many who need care right now,\" but said it was \"not a permanent solution.\" Conservatives have appealed the temporary injunction.\n\nThe Reproductive Freedom for All amendment proposes a new and general right to reproductive freedom, including the right to access abortions and birth control without political interference.\n\nThe language of the proposed amendment leaves the door open to regulate abortions \"after fetal viability.\" The amendment defines that as the point when a fetus could likely survive outside the uterus \"without the application of extraordinary medical measures\" as determined by a health care professional. The proposed amendment, however, would bar any prohibition of abortions deemed medically necessary.\n\nOpponents of the constitutional amendment have encouraged voters to decline to sign petitions to place the measure on the ballot and are gearing up to challenge the measure ahead of the November election.\n\n\"We're anticipating that voters will not support this and it will not pass in November if they even get on the ballot,\" said Christen Pollo, the spokesperson for the Citizens to Support MI Women and Children coalition opposing the Reproductive Freedom for All amendment. In the meantime, she said the group is pursuing \"every avenue available\" to keep the proposal off the ballot.\n\nShe dubbed Reproductive Freedom for All the \"anything goes abortion amendment,\" and said it is \"vastly different\" from the abortion rights guaranteed under Roe and would allow abortion \"at any point in pregnancy.\"\n\n\"That's not true,\" said Bonsitu Kitaba, the deputy legal director for the ACLU of Michigan. The amendment ensures a right to abortion up to fetal viability while allowing medical providers' assessments of their patients' health to determine whether an abortion is necessary past that point, Kitaba said. Doctors need to have \"all available medical treatment options, including C-section and induction and abortion if that's the best course for that particular patient and their health.\"\n\nIn addition to the pending Planned Parenthood of Michigan lawsuit, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has filed her own lawsuit asking the Michigan Supreme Court to strike down a state law banning abortions.\n\nWhitmer's lawsuit argues that state law violates a right to bodily integrity provided under the state's constitution. The state's high court has not yet indicated whether it will weigh in on the matter, but the court has asked Whitmer's legal team to address key procedural questions following the temporary injunction on the state's abortion ban issued by the lower court in the Planned Parenthood lawsuit.\n\nKhogali said that the Reproductive Freedom for All constitutional amendment would give voters an opportunity to \"reinforce\" the right to an abortion and \"have it explicitly stated in the constitution.\"\n\n[ Want more updates on this developing story?

The state Senate-ordered review of Maricopa County's election took longer to get going. And to wrap up.\n\nThe review began April 23 after months of legal wrangling to obtain the county's ballots, voting machines and other election materials.\n\nReports delivered Sept. 24 confirmed Biden’s win in the county, but raised questions about ballots and voters.\n\nAnd Republicans in the Arizona Legislature say they will continue to advocate for election-related changes when they convene again in 2022.\n\nHere's a look back on how we got here.\n\n2020: A contentious election\n\nNov. 3: Election night tallies show Joe Biden defeating then-President Donald Trump in Arizona, although the race remains tight with many votes left to count. Trump says he plans to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent states from counting outstanding ballots late into the night, which he calls a “fraud.” However, in Arizona, Trump says there are many votes left to count and that he shouldn't be discounted yet.\n\nNov. 4: Protests and election lawsuits begin. Some 100 people rally at the state Capitol. Republican State Rep. Kelly Townsend urges them to sign affidavits about their voting experience and to contact Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward. An election lawsuit related to the use of Sharpies is filed, despite election officials across Arizona saying the use of the felt-tip pen to fill out ballots is not a problem. The case is dropped three days later.\n\nToward evening, more people gather outside the Maricopa County election center as workers continue to count votes.\n\nRepublican Clint Hickman, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Supervisor Steve Gallardo, the board's only Democrat, issue a bipartisan request for patience, saying an accurate vote count takes time. \"It's possible the results you see now may change after all the votes are counted. This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.\"\n\nNov. 5: Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones rallies people outside the county elections center in Phoenix. “The world is watching the example of Arizona, the president is watching the example, you’re not gonna let ‘em steal this,\" Jones tells the crowd.\n\nNov. 7: Arizona continues counting ballots, but Biden is projected to win Pennsylvania, which pushes him across the 270 electoral college threshold. Meanwhile, a pressure campaign on Maricopa County leaders by the state GOP chair begins. Text messages and voicemails reveal multipronged attempts by Ward to halt Trump’s impending loss in Arizona.\n\nNov. 13: Maricopa County completes its final count, showing Biden beat Trump. Hours later, Ward texts Hickman: “POTUS will probably be calling you.” Hickman later tells The Arizona Republic that the call didn't come until New Year's Eve, and he let the White House switchboard go to voicemail.\n\nNov. 22: State leaders face pressure, too. Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani call Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers. The pair expresses concerns about widespread election fraud and suggests Bowers can help, saying Arizona law allows the state Legislature — rather than voters — to choose its electors.\n\nBowers, when telling Arizona Republic reporters about the phone call months later, says he expressed skepticism and sought evidence. “You are giving me nothing but conjecture and asking me to break my oath and commit to doing something I cannot do because I swore I wouldn't. I will follow the Constitution,” he tells Trump and Giuliani.\n\nNov. 30: Giuliani and others gather in a downtown Phoenix hotel presenting election fraud theories. The goal seems to be to persuade Arizona legislators to intercede with the state's election results. At the Capitol, state officials officially certify the results showing Trump lost. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who campaigned with Trump, expresses confidence in the process. \"We do elections well here in Arizona,\" he says.\n\nDec. 1: Giuliani and other Trump allies, such as Jenna Ellis and retired Army Col. Phil Waldron, meet with Republican lawmakers, including Bowers and Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, in a state Senate meeting room. Ellis claims lawmakers can replace the state's 11 presidential electors, whose votes are supposed to go to Biden, with electors for Trump.\n\nBowers leaves the meeting underwhelmed by the fraud claims and unwilling to seek to replace electors. “We were being asked to do something huge, and we thought we were going to get the evidence at the meeting,” he later tells The Republic.\n\nDec. 4: Bowers and Fann issue a joint statement calling for an independent audit of Maricopa County’s Dominion Voting Systems software and voting machines. Bowers is looking to work cooperatively with the county and with accredited experts.\n\nOne America News personality Christina Bobb emails Fann on behalf of Giuliani offering what they viewed as pertinent information and a promise of continued contact. “Good morning, Ma’am,” Bobb writes. “Mayor Giuliani asked me to send you these declarations. He will follow up with you as well.”\n\nDec. 8: Bowers, Fann, Hickman and attorneys and staffers for all sides meet via Zoom to cooperatively discuss issues such as how ballots are counted, the status of election-related lawsuits and how an accredited firm could review Dominion Voting Systems software and voting machines.\n\nDec. 9: Bowers and Fann acknowledge to each other that members of the GOP caucuses want public hearings. Bowers would later relay to The Republic that he is concerned about adding to \"the circus,\" but Fann says they need to do something. Bowers agrees to a joint House-Senate committee hearing on one condition: No subpoenas would demand the county produce information. He wants to work cooperatively with county officials rather than to create a legal battle.\n\nMeanwhile, thinking the last of at least eight unsuccessful election lawsuits is over, the Board of Supervisors brings in two officials from Pro V&V, an Alabama company accredited by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, to examine the Dominion machines. While they are in the air, Hickman learns that Ward, the state GOP chair, will appeal her case. The pair fly out of Phoenix the next day as the county, during litigation, doesn't want anyone to touch the machines, which could be considered evidence.\n\nDec. 10: Fann and state Sen. Eddie Farnsworth, R-Gilbert, a longtime friend of Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, an outspoken Trump ally, meet with county representatives without Bowers and the House. The senators tell county staff they intend to hold an election-related hearing without the House and raise the issue of subpoenas. Ahead of the hearing, Fann tells Bowers her caucus is moving ahead on its own. “OK. Good luck,” he recalls telling her. Bowers tells The Republic that Fann's decision is one of the \"nagging mysteries,\" saying he has no idea why she shifted away from a cooperative, joint audit.\n\nDec. 14: County officials spend the day answering questions at the Senate hearing. At the end, Farnsworth announces he will issue subpoenas.\n\nDec. 15: Arizona Senate Republican leaders send subpoenas to Maricopa County for all ballots cast in the November election, voting machines, voter rolls and more information for \"forensic analysis.\" One of the demands is for \"ranked-choice voting,\" which is not something Arizona uses. This suggests that Farnsworth did not write the subpoenas.\n\nDec. 17: Bowers texts Hickman to express his disappointment with the Senate's approach. The county supervisor responds: \"Thank you for sticking with us. It’s called rational leadership in irrational times and I am positive history will be kind to us.”\n\nDec. 18: The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors files suit to fight the subpoenas, saying they are too broad and would violate voters' privacy.\n\nDec. 24: Giuliani calls County Supervisor Jack Sellers. “I’m hoping we could have a chance to have a conversation,” a transcription of Giuliani’s message to Sellers says. “I’d like to see if there’s a way that we can resolve this so that it comes out well for everyone. We’re all Republicans, I think we have the same goal. … Let’s see if we can get this done outside of the court, gosh.” Sellers does not return the call.\n\n2021: The ballot recount and more\n\nJan. 6: Biggs calls Bowers and asks if he would support decertifying Arizona's electors. Bowers says he would not. Later that day, Biggs stands on the floor of the House of Representatives and urges his colleagues to set aside electors from Arizona, Georgia and other states. Before the House votes to reject Biggs’ arguments, hundreds of Trump supporters break into the U.S. Capitol, sparking a deadly riot.\n\nJan. 12: With the start of new legislative terms, Fann and state Sen. Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, who replaced the retired Farnsworth as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, reissue a subpoena to the county for its ballots and election equipment.\n\nJan. 27: The county's Board of Supervisors votes to conduct an audit to try to put election integrity concerns to rest, but Fann says it doesn't go far enough.\n\nFeb. 5: Fann communicates with Doug Logan, who owns a small cybersecurity firm in Florida called Cyber Ninjas. This early communication would become publicly known months later in response to a public records request. Logan, at this point, already was working with Trump allies to uncover election fraud.\n\nFeb. 8: The Arizona Senate votes on whether to hold the Board of Supervisors in contempt for not fully responding to the subpoenas. Such a vote could lead to the arrest of the county's elected supervisors. Amid tensions leading up to the vote, Hickman tells the Senate chief of staff of protests at his home — one that drew 90 angry people and evoked fears of the riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThat morning, state Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, and Supervisors Bill Gates and Sellers gather in Fann’s office. Gates lays out his case: The supervisors were in court over the subpoenas, seeking direction from a judge. By the county’s reading of the law, the ballots and machines had to remain locked up for a certain period after the election. Either way, he says, the county needed clarity from the court, and a judge would decide soon.\n\n“We’re in court to get direction,\" Gates remembers saying. \"You don’t need to do this. Why would you?” Fann says no one will get jailed and that it is a procedural move to compel information. She takes the contempt charge to a vote on the Senate floor. Boyer is the lone Republican to vote against it, leading to its defeat.\n\n“My no vote today will give the board time to resolve itself on how to legally proceed with providing these public records for independent sunshine and scrutiny, while also providing 100% protection for the private nature of an individual’s vote,\" Boyer says.\n\nFeb. 23: Auditors hired by the county found no malicious hardware on voting machines, the machines were not connected to the internet, and the machines were programmed to tabulate ballots accurately.\n\nFeb. 26: Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason rules the legislative subpoenas are valid. County officials say they will work to provide the materials.\n\nFeb. 27: Fann sends a text message to Waldron, the retired Army colonel and Trump ally who cast himself as an election-security expert, to inquire about Logan, the Cyber Ninjas CEO. Fann says she felt \"more comfortable\" after Waldron vouched for Logan.\n\nMarch 10: Hundreds of people flock to Queen Creek, southeast of Phoenix, for an event promoted by the Arizona Republican Party: \"The Mike Lindell Election Integrity, Faith and Freedom” event, which was sponsored by We the People Alliance AZ. “Arizona is going to pave the way,” Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow and an ardent Trump supporter, says to cheers. “We are chosen for such a time as this by God.”\n\nMarch 31: Fann announces Cyber Ninjas will lead the Senate's audit. The firm has no election auditing experience, but Logan has touted widespread election fraud claims on social media. Election experts say the $150,000 price tag is too low and raises concerns about partisanship, the time frame and the lack of transparency.\n\nApril 22: The Arizona Democratic Party and county Supervisor Gallardo sue to stop the audit because of security and other concerns. The lawsuit is filed the same day the county begins delivering the ballots, voting machines and other requested materials to Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, which is leased for the hand recount.\n\nApril 23: Journalists initially are denied entry to observe the audit unless they sign up as a volunteer observer. The recount begins with one reporter in the coliseum who signed up to work a six-hour shift as a volunteer observer. The Republic's Jen Fifield questions Cyber Ninjas' CEO about blue pens she spots on the recount tables. Voting machines can read black and blue ink, which is why recounts should use an alternative color. After checking, Logan has blue pens removed and replaced with green pens before any real ballots are taken out of the boxes.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Christopher Coury, concerned by uncertainties about the audit procedures, orders the Arizona Senate to \"pause\" its recount if the state Democratic Party, which asked for the halt, posts a $1 million bond to cover any costs from the delay. The Democratic Party does not post the bond, and the audit continues.\n\nApril 27: Local journalists obtain limited access to the coliseum during the recount.\n\nApril 28: A judge requires Cyber Ninjas to provide the audit procedures it fought to keep secret.\n\nApril 30: Republic reporter Ryan Randazzo is removed from the coliseum and told his press privileges are revoked after posting a photo showing a former Republican legislator at a ballot-counting table. The photo shows a ballot, with no markings discernible, on a vertical stand in front of former state Rep. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale. The Senate later reverses its revocation of Randazzo's access.\n\nMay 5: The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sends a letter questioning the Arizona Senate about the audit’s security and potential for voter intimidation.\n\nMay 6: The Republic reports that efforts to recruit people to recount ballots appear targeted in part at traditionally conservative groups — and some of the recruiters have far-right political ties.\n\nMay 7: Fann drops a controversial plan to go door to door to ask local residents about their voting history as part of its audit. The decision to halt the canvassing portion of the audit is in response to the DOJ's inquiry.\n\nMay 7: Maricopa County officials refuse to provide access to its computer routers. Sheriff Paul Penzone calls the demand \"mind-numbingly reckless and irresponsible,\" saying it could compromise law enforcement data.\n\nMay 12: Fann asks county officials to meet to answer questions, saying she wants to \"constructively resolve these issues and questions without recourse to additional subpoenas or other compulsory process.\" The audit's Twitter account strikes a different tone, accusing the county of deleting election databases and spoliation of evidence.\n\nMay 14: The original deadline to complete the hand recount comes and goes. The Senate has extended its coliseum lease through June 30.\n\nMay 15: Trump alleges, among other things, \"The entire Database of Maricopa County in Arizona has been DELETED!\" and calls it an \"election crime.\" Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican elected in November, responds on Twitter: \"Wow. This is unhinged. I’m literally looking at our voter registration database on my other screen. Right now.\"\n\nMay 17: Sellers blasts Fann for trying to legitimize \"a grift disguised as an audit.\" As for the files Fann said were missing, the county says contractors likely failed to properly download or search the county's databases, which made it so database and directories appeared to be missing. \"We wouldn’t be asked to do this on-the-job training if qualified auditors had been hired to do this work,\" Sellers says. The Senate's contractors would later tell Fann that they found the files in question.\n\nMay 20: Arizona's top election official, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, says she may not allow the county to reuse hundreds of vote-counting machines provided, after a subpoena, to Fann's contractors. Replacing the machines could cost millions.\n\nMay 22: An email obtained by The Republic shows a nonprofit started by former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne will handle background checks, nondisclosure agreements and volunteer agreements of audit workers. Byrne's nonprofit also is raising money for the audit. Byrne wrote \"The Deep Rig,\" a book turned movie claiming election fraud.\n\nMay 24: Scottsdale-based technology company StratTech Solutions takes over running the hand count when Pennsylvania-based Wake TSI doesn't renew its contract past May 14.\n\nJune 2: The audit is a boon to the Arizona Republican Party, which has raised far more money this year than it did at this point last year, The Republic reports. Leaders in other states are paying attention. Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican, visits the coliseum with colleagues and says he wants an Arizona-style audit in his state. Others from states such as Alaska, Wisconsin and Georgia follow.\n\nJune 3: Maricopa County election data is in a \"secure lab\" in Montana, or maybe a log cabin in the woods. The Republic reports that a contractor hired by the Arizona Senate is reviewing the election data from an undisclosed location in Montana, with no oversight from state or county officials.\n\nJune 26: The CEO of the company leading the audit appears in a new movie called \"The Deep Rig\" that asserts the election was stolen from Trump. \"If we don’t fix our election integrity now, we may no longer have a democracy,\" Logan says in the film that premiered in Phoenix. The film is based on a book by Byrne and features former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nJune 28: Maricopa County will not reuse voting machines that were in the custody of the Senate's contractors. The county Board of Supervisors sends a letter to the Arizona secretary of state that the board shares her concerns about whether the hundreds of vote-counting machines that they had to give the Senate's contractors are safe to use, in part considering the contractors are not certified to handle election equipment in the U.S.\n\nJune 30: The Republic files a special action in Maricopa County Superior Court seeking financial records and communications about the audit from the Senate and lead contractor Cyber Ninjas.\n\nJuly 1: The county's ballots and voting machines are moved out of the coliseum as the Senate's lease ends and into a swamp-cooled building at the state fairgrounds.\n\nJuly 8: Fann says the Senate will conduct its own recount of the total number of county ballots cast in the general election. The Senate purchased two paper-counting machines to serve as a check on the work done by its contractor and county elections officials. But the attorney hired by the Cyber Ninjas to help run its audit is now helping the Senate with its check, raising questions about its independence.\n\nJuly 14: County supervisors vote to spend $2.8 million to buy new voting equipment to replace the machines that were in custody of the Senate's contractors during the review.\n\nJuly 15: Logan meets with Fann and Petersen in a public hearing to share some of his findings and what he needs to complete the review, including the county's routers.\n\nJuly 23: A thunderstorm leads to a leaky roof at the state fairgrounds building where the review continues. Workers quickly move ballot boxes away from the leaks and cover boxes with tarps. \"No ballots are at risk,\" an audit spokesperson says.\n\nJuly 23: Ken Bennett, whom state Senate leaders put in charge as their liaison to the election review, is banned from the building where the work is happening and weighs stepping down. The decision to block Bennett came after learning he secretly shared initial results from a new ballot count with an outside group, according to Randy Pullen, another Senate spokesperson and former chairman of the state GOP. Bennett eventually regains access and continues in his role.\n\nJuly 26: GOP Senate leaders file another subpoena for the county's routers and other election items. They also issue a subpoena to Dominion Voting Systems for user names, passwords, tokens and pins to its machines.\n\nJuly 29: Workers at the state fairgrounds load nearly 2.1 million ballots onto trucks and return them to the county, ending the more than three-month process of reviewing ballots and other election equipment. And Cyber Ninjas releases long-sought details on who funded the audit, which was far pricier than the $150,000 that the state Senate agreed to pay. A handful of nonprofits whose leaders pushed the election fraud narrative have poured more than $5.6 million into the audit so far. Among the leaders are Byrne, Flynn, former Trump attorney Sidney Powell and far-right One America News Network correspondent Christina Bobb.\n\nAug. 2: County supervisors and Dominion Voting Systems refuse to produce election materials in response to the Senate's new subpoenas. \"The board has real work to do and little time to entertain this adventure in never-never land,\" Sellers says.\n\nAug. 5: Fann and other Republicans in her caucus are fighting to keep secret the records of the audit despite a judge's order that they \"immediately\" hand over all communications related to the effort.\n\nAug. 18: County supervisors lodge a notice of claim with the Arizona Senate for more than $2.8 million it spent replacing vote-counting machines that were potentially compromised as a result of the election review.\n\nAug. 23: The Cyber Ninjas' draft report is expected this day, but instead, Fann announces Logan and several members of his team are sick with COVID-19.\n\nAug. 26: Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the county could lose millions in state-shared funding if it doesn't turn over routers the state Senate subpoenaed.\n\nAug. 30: Fann had put canvassing on hold as part of the audit, but a local group continues its efforts to go door to door to learn more about voters. Chandler real estate agent Liz Harris has led a canvassing effort known as the “Voter Integrity Project” since December, mobilizing thousands of volunteers, The Republic reports.\n\nAug. 31: The Arizona Senate releases texts and emails that offer glimpses into the audit but withholds thousands of other documents. Two judges had ordered the Senate to turn over the records. The documents show Cleta Mitchell, a prominent Republican attorney who advised Trump as he tried to overturn the 2020 election, helped set up an escrow account to funnel money to companies working on the audit. The documents also show the state Senate hired Shiva Ayyadurai, a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine activist, to review voter signatures on the county's mail-in ballot envelopes.\n\nSept. 3: The Republic reports Arizona taxpayers have footed nearly $425,000 for the costs of the audit Senate Republicans are conducting, with thousands of dollars more in bills yet to come. The largest expense is for $223,000 in legal fees paid through July, followed by $68,100 for security costs at the state fairgrounds in May, state records show.\n\nSept. 15: Fann directs the CEO of Cyber Ninjas to turn over all communications related to the election audit after the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a lower court's order for the Senate to make the Cyber Ninjas' documents public as part of a public-record lawsuit. The Republic and a left-leaning watchdog group called American Oversight both sued the Senate when Fann and the other members did not grant requests for emails, texts and other communications concerning the audit.\n\nSept. 16: Fann says the Arizona Senate will receive the audit report at 1 p.m. Sept. 24.\n\nSept. 17: County supervisors and state Senate leaders strike a settlement related to reviewing the county's routers as part of the election review. The county raised security concerns about giving the Senate's contractors access to the routers. Under the deal, the contractors will not have access to the routers, but the county will hire former U.S. Rep. John Shadegg to answer the Senate's questions about the routers. The county also agrees to no longer seek Senate repayment for potentially compromised voting machines.\n\nSept. 22: County Supervisor Steve Chucri announces he will resign after recordings surface of him talking about the 2020 election and his county colleagues. In the leaked recordings, Chucri bashed other supervisors for their lack of support for the Senate's audit and indicated he thought there were fraudulent votes cast in the election. Chucri, in announcing his resignation, said the comments were made at a \"very turbulent time\" and that \"the election was not stolen. (Joe) Biden won.\"\n\nSept. 23: An early version of the Cyber Ninjas' report obtained by The Republic shows that the hand recount confirmed what was announced in November: Biden won. The draft reports reviewed by The Republic minimize the ballot counts and instead focus on issues that raise questions about the election process and voter integrity. Meanwhile, American Oversight asks a judge to find the Arizona Senate in contempt of a court order for not turning over Cyber Ninjas' emails and other records from the election audit.\n\nSept. 24: Results of the election review are presented to the Arizona Senate Republicans who ordered it. Election conspiracists loyal to Trump had believed a thorough review would show county elections officials didn't get it right, but Fann dashes their hopes. She confirms in her opening remarks the hand recount of ballots shows Biden won the election in Maricopa County, cementing his win in Arizona. “That is a true statement,\" Fann says as a packed audience in the Senate gallery listens quietly.\n\nShe adds, though, that she believes there were \"broken statutes\" and flawed election procedures — issues she will turn over to the state attorney general to investigate. In a letter to Brnovich, Fann says the Senate is already working on legislation to ensure Arizona has “an unimpeachable election process.”\n\nSept. 26: Election experts say the Arizona Senate had a chance to do something extraordinary when it set out to audit the county's election results but instead hired partisan contractors who didn't have knowledge of elections and used questionable methods. The results, they say, did nothing to strengthen elections. The Senate's election review only sows doubts — just as it was designed to do, they say.\n\nSept. 28: Arizona Attorney General Brnovich, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, takes initial steps to investigate the 2020 presidential election, directing the county to hold onto records and asking the Senate to share evidence gathered by its contractors.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of the election review don't stop misinformation. A far-right news outlet, Gateway Pundit, publishes a doctored version of the Cyber Ninjas' draft report saying Maricopa County's election should be decertified. Logan, who led the ballot review, told The Republic he never recommended decertifying the county's election.\n\nNov. 1: Fann announces she will retire from the Legislature when her current term ends in January 2023.\n\nNov. 15: Three nationally recognized election experts issue a report saying Cyber Ninjas' hand count cannot be validated or replicated. Their report comes after reviewing tallies on every vote counted by the Cyber Ninjas. The Senate on Nov. 1 released nearly 80,000 images of tally sheets related to the hand count. \"We have tried dozens of ways to include and exclude various boxes and batches to arrive at those precise figures and have been unable to replicate their announced results,\" The Audit Guys write. Logan calls the claims \"outlandish,\" false and libelous. Logan does not respond to questions about the report or identify anything in it that he considered untrue.\n\nNov. 23: Boyer, who cast the deciding vote against holding the Board of Supervisors in contempt for not responding fully to the Senate subpoenas, says he will leave the Legislature when his term expires in January 2023. The Glendale Republican describes a \"toxic\" atmosphere at the Capitol and says he's lost the enthusiasm to seek a third Senate term amid what was likely to be a bruising primary challenge.\n\nDec. 22: Public-records lawsuits filed by the nonprofit organization American Oversight and another filed by The Arizona Republic continue to be heard in Arizona courts. Every ruling in the cases has ordered Cyber Ninjas to turn over records with a nexus to the audit, but the firm thus far has failed to do so.\n\nCyber Ninjas, in addition to arguing unsuccessfully that audit-related documents are not public records, contends it can't afford the cost of producing records, nor the cost of preparing a detailed log of redacted items. The Republic's attorney, David Bodney, sent a letter to Cyber Ninjas' law firm warning that The Republic likely will seek legal fees not only from Cyber Ninjas but from their lawyers as well because they continue to withhold the records.\n\n\"Cyber Ninjas’ flouting of the Arizona Public Records Law has been enabled through its assertion of meritless legal positions, its disobedience of court orders, its repetition of rejected legal theories, and its interpretation of those orders in a manner that twists them beyond recognition,\" Bodney wrote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/media/fox-news-hillary-clinton-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "Sean Hannity dares Hillary Clinton to sue as she warns network's ...", "text": "(CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nFox's obsession with Hillary Clinton is only growing more fierce.\n\nThe right-wing talk channel, which has in recent days dishonestly twisted a court filing from special counsel John Durham to accuse Clinton of nefariously spying on Donald Trump, mentioned Clinton's name nearly 200 times Thursday, according to a search of rush TV transcripts. The escalation in the network's already-manic coverage of the former presidential candidate came after she delivered remarks at the New York Democratic convention.\n\nFox carried Clinton's remarks briefly before abruptly cutting away when she started to talk about the Big Lie. But if the network had stuck with her speech, the channel's viewers would have heard Clinton rip into Fox's recent coverage of her. \"Fox leads the charge with accusations against me, counting on their audience to fall for it again,\" Clinton said. She then invoked some legal language. \"As an aside,\" Clinton said about Fox, \"they're getting awfully close to actual malice.\" Clinton spox Nick Merrill wrote on Twitter that she had \"called them and their bulls**t out by name.\"\n\nA rep for Fox didn't respond when I asked about Clinton mentioning \"actual malice,\" the bar a public figure needs to clear in order to succeed in a defamation lawsuit. But Sean Hannity addressed Clinton directly during his Thursday night show. \"Malice, really? It's called news,\" the right-wing propagandist claimed . \"Hillary, we invite you to bring it on.\" Of course, while it is extremely unlikely Clinton would take any such legal action against Fox, I would be curious to know what the network's lawyers think of him daring her to sue for defamation.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/media/scotusblog-supreme-court-news-site-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "The husband-and-wife team running SCOTUSblog sees boost in ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter.

Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and committee member who led parts of Tuesday's hearing, said during his opening statements.\n\nHere are some takeaways from Tuesday's hearing.\n\nPanel highlights Trump's 'call to arms' tweet\n\nThe panel repeatedly highlighted a Trump tweet from December 2020, which they said was a galvanizing call-to-arms that motivated his supporters to come to Washington and disrupt the transition of power.\n\nThe tweet claimed that it was \"statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,\" and said there would be a \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th.\" Trump infamously added, \"Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nRep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat who led part of the hearing, said that the post was \"a call to action, and in some cases as a call to arms, for many of President Trump's most loyal supporters,\" citing comments from many of the rioters and far-right extremists, who said they were inspired by the tweet.\n\nAfter the tweet, pro-Trump groups rescheduled planned protests for late January and switched the date to January 6, according to the committee. \"Stop the Steal\" leader Ali Alexander quickly registered the website WildProtest.com and used the site as a clearinghouse for information about the protest.\n\nRight-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones promoted Trump's tweet and urged people to flock to DC. Jim Watkins, the administrator of 8kun, an online forum that is the home of the QAnon conspiracy, told the House panel that he decided to go to Washington on January 6 after Trump's tweet.\n\n\"There is going to be a red wedding going down January 6,\" a person identified as Salty Cracker said in another clip, referring to a massacre from the television show \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nDetails uncovered for the planning behind Trump's 'unexpected' call to march to the Capitol\n\nThe committee unveiled evidence Tuesday showing how Trump's call for his supporters to march to the Capitol on January 6 had been planned in advance.\n\nThe committee showed a draft tweet -- which Trump did not send -- calling for marching to the Capitol. \"I will be making a Big Speech at 10AM on January 6th at the Ellipse (South of the White House). Please arrive early, massive crowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the Steal!!\" the draft tweet says. The tweet, which the committee obtained from the National Archives, includes a stamp saying \"President has seen.\"\n\nIn addition, the committee showed a text message it obtained from rally organizer Kylie Jane Kremer to right-wing businessman Mike Lindell that said the President would \"unexpectedly\" tell his supporters to march to another stage outside the Supreme Court building, which is behind the Capitol.\n\n\"It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for it 'unexpectedly,'\" Kremer wrote.\n\nKatrina Pierson, who also helped organize the rally, wrote in an email to her fellow organizers on January 2: \"POTUS expectations are to have something intimate at the ellipse and call on everyone to march to the capitol.\"\n\nAlexander, another organizer, sent a text message on January 5, 2021, that was obtained by the committee: \"Tomorrow: Ellipse then US capitol. Trump is supposed to order us to capitol at the end of his speech but we will see.\"\n\nRole of GOP lawmakers in Trump's election scheme once again featured\n\nTuesday's hearing focused yet again on the role that Republican members of Congress played helping Trump's efforts to try to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe committee's presentation pointed to a December 21, 2020, meeting where Trump met with Republican members to discuss efforts to object to the election in Congress on January 6, citing White House logs to list the 10 members and members-elect who attended the meeting.\n\nIn previous hearings, the committee has highlighted how members of Congress tried to help Trump provide evidence of voter fraud and connect the White House with a Justice Department official who was supportive of Trump's baseless claims of fraud. In addition, the panel provided new evidence showing how multiple members of Congress sought pardons from Trump after January 6.\n\nMurphy noted that the December 2020 meeting happened several days before Trump told top Justice Department officials that he wanted them to publicly announce that the election was illegitimate and \"leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\"\n\nThe committee also played audio Tuesday of comments from Arizona GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko. In audio from January 5, 2021, Lesko asked congressional leadership to \"come up with a safety plan for members,\" raising concerns about what would happen on January 6. The audio was obtained by New York Times journalists Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin from their book \"This Will Not Pass\" and aired on CNN last month.\n\n\"I'm actually very concerned about this, because we have who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people coming here. We have Antifa. We also have, quite honestly, Trump supporters, who actually believe that we are going to overturn the election. And when that doesn't happen -- most likely will not happen -- they are going to go nuts,\" Lesko said.\n\nGOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, one of the lawmakers the House panel said attended the December 2020 meeting, is collecting signatures for a letter calling on the House Oversight Committee to hold \"immediate\" hearings and investigations into debunked election fraud allegations featured in the movie \"2000 Mules,\" according to a draft copy of the letter obtained by CNN. The film has been widely debunked, and Trump's former Attorney General William Barr mocked the movie during a taped deposition for the select committee.\n\nCipollone interview plays a key role in Tuesday's hearing\n\nTuesday's hearing was the select committee's first chance to show video clips from former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who was interviewed by the committee in a video deposition on Friday.\n\nCipollone's testimony added a top voice to the chorus of former Trump aides who have testified to the committee they told the President there was no substantial evidence that the election was stolen from him.\n\nThe video clips of Trump's former aides, which have been played throughout the January 6 hearings, have helped the committee illustrate how those around Trump didn't believe his baseless claims about the election, even as he continued to plow ahead with efforts to try to overturn the election leading up to January 6.\n\nThe committee issued a subpoena to ultimately obtain Cipollone's video testimony last week after he was called out at an earlier hearing for not agreeing to sit for a deposition. The committee played 14 clips from Cipollone's pivotal eight-hour interview last week, which highlighted the split that had grown between Trump and his highest-ranking legal adviser.\n\nIn the clips played Tuesday, Cipollone said he was told by then-chief of staff Mark Meadows that in November 2020 Trump would eventually agree to make a graceful departure, that he believed Trump should concede, and that he argued the proposal for the federal government to seize voting machines was a \"terrible idea.\"\n\n\"That's not how we do things in the United States. There's no legal authority to do that,\" Cipollone said. \"There is a way to contest elections. You know, that happens all the time. But the idea that the federal government could come in and seize election machines -- I don't understand why I would even have to tell you why that's a bad idea for the country. That's a terrible idea.\"\n\nThere were numerous clips of Cipollone's interview played Tuesday, but he could play an even larger role in next week's hearing that's expected to focus on what was going on inside the West Wing while the Capitol attack occurred on January 6.\n\nIn-person witnesses lament their right-wing radicalization\n\nThe two in-person witnesses at Tuesday's hearing described how they were radicalized by right-wing groups and Trump himself, and how it destroyed their lives and continues to pose a threat to American society.\n\nJason Van Tatenhove, a former national spokesman for the Oath Keepers, described the \"radicalization\" that he witnessed with the group, and said the country was \"lucky\" there wasn't more bloodshed on January 6, when four rioters and one police officer died. Other police officers later died by suicide.\n\n\"I'll admit, I was, at one point, swept up too,\" Van Tatenhove said of his time with the Oath Keepers. \"There were many red flags, and I probably should have broken from them earlier than I did.\"\n\nStephen Ayres, a convicted Capitol rioter who breached the building on January 6, returned to Capitol Hill on Tuesday as a cooperating witness. He explained how he was \"riled up\" by Trump's speech and never planned to go to the Capitol but was \"following what (Trump) said\" during his Ellipse address.\n\nHe said because of January 6, he lost his job, sold his house and was a convicted criminal.\n\n\"It changed my life, not for the good, definitely not for the better,\" he said. He added that he no longer believes Trump's lies about the 2020 election, but warned that there are millions of people who still do, which poses a threat for future elections.\n\n\"It could end up being down the same path we are right now,\" Ayres said. \"I felt like I had horse blinders on. Take the blinders off, and make sure you step back and see what's going on, before it's too late.\"\n\nSix witnesses detail 'unhinged' Oval Office meeting in December 2020\n\nThe committee revealed during Tuesday's hearing testimony from six participants of a December 18, 2020, Oval Office meeting that devolved into chaos as Trump allies clashed with White House lawyers over various plans for overturning the presidential election -- with Trump looking on.\n\nRaskin said the December 18 meeting was \"critically important because President Trump got to watch up close for several hours as his White House counsel and other White House lawyers destroyed the baseless factual claims and ridiculous legal arguments offered by Sidney Powell, Mike Flynn and others.\"\n\nThe committee played video from its interviews with six witnesses who took part in the heated meeting, including Cipollone, who told the panel that he was \"not happy\" to see people such as Flynn, Powell and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne in the Oval Office with the former President.\n\n\"I don't think any of these people were providing the President with good advice, so I did not understand how they had gotten in,\" Cipollone said in his deposition, according to video played by the committee Tuesday.\n\nOthers who were in the room described how the hours-long meeting broke into screaming matches as outside Trump allies Flynn and Powell accused White House advisers of quitting on the President after they challenged their baseless claims about election fraud and outlandish plans for overturning the results.\n\nWhite House lawyer Eric Herschmann also told the committee that the meeting got to the point where \"screaming was completely -- completely out there.\"\n\n\"It was really unprecedented. ... I thought it was nuts,\" he said in the deposition video, acknowledging he told the group of outside Trump allies to \"shut the F up.\"\n\nPowell accused the White House lawyers of failing to propose any ideas and showing \"nothing but contempt and disdain of the President\" during the meeting, according to video from her deposition.\n\nWhite House aides who participated in the meeting, including Cipollone, also pushed back intensely on the suggestion of naming Powell as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud allegations when it was raised in the meeting.\n\nFlynn had suggested prior to the meeting that Trump could invoke martial law as part of his efforts to overturn the election that he lost to President-elect Joe Biden -- an idea that arose again during the meeting in the Oval Office, a source previously told CNN.\n\nAt the time, it wasn't clear whether Trump endorsed the idea, but others in the room forcefully pushed back and shot it down.\n\nAnother idea floated in the meeting was an executive order that would permit the government to access voting machines to inspect them, CNN has reported and deposition video played Tuesday confirmed.\n\nThe committee was able to illuminate this extraordinary meeting -- and another meeting on January 5, while a \"stop the steal\" rally was underway blocks from the White House -- thanks to testimony from multiple White House aides, lawyers, even an official photographer. This strong level of cooperation from Trump insiders made it possible for the panel to bring these details to light.\n\nTrump's rhetoric 'killed someone,' former campaign manager privately acknowledged\n\nA series of text messages presented during Tuesday's hearing are perhaps the most significant and stark piece of evidence yet about how those closest to Trump felt about what he was doing on January 6.\n\nThe messages show that Brad Parscale, Trump's former campaign manager, privately acknowledged that he felt \"guilty for helping him win,\" and believed the former President's rhetoric killed someone on January 6, 2021.\n\nParscale also said that Trump was \"asking for civil war,\" according to text messages he sent to Pierson, a former Trump campaign spokesperson, which were released by the committee Tuesday.\n\nThe correspondence underscores how Trump allies were reacting in real time to what was unfolding on January 6 -- events that caused some in the former President's inner circle to pledge they would no longer support him.\n\n\"This week I feel guilty for helping him win,\" texted Parscale, who served as Trump campaign's digital director in 2016 and as Trump's campaign manager until July 2020, when Bill Stepien took over.\n\nPierson then tried to reassure Parscale. \"You did what you felt right at the time and therefore it was right,\" she texted.\n\n\"Yeah. But a woman is dead,\" texted Parscale, possibly referring to Ashli Babbitt, a pro-Trump rioter who was fatally shot by a US Capitol Police officer after the crowd pushed toward the entrance to the Speaker's Lobby in the Capitol.\n\nAfter Pierson disputed that it was Trump's rhetoric that led to the death, Parscale texted, \"Katrina.\"\n\n\"Yes it was,\" Parscale added.\n\nWhile Parscale's messages offer a rare window into the minds of those most loyal to Trump on January 6, they also underscore how even those who were most disgusted by the former President's actions that day were willing to meet with him after declaring they had lost faith.\n\nCommittee follows Justice Department's lead on extremists\n\nMany of the previous hearings featured shocking new revelations that even seemed to catch the Justice Department off-guard, especially with the recent bombshell testimony of Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson. The panel has also used its hearings to disclose the fruits of its own investigation, and to publicly prod federal prosecutors to ramp up its criminal investigation.\n\nBut things were a little different on Tuesday. In many ways, this time around, the committee took its cues from the Justice Department, and relied heavily on information that previously came out as part of the Justice Department's major conspiracy cases against the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys,\n\nLawmakers mentioned internal text messages, details of how these militants planned for violence, and other information connecting these militants to Trump allies Flynn and Roger Stone. Much of this information has been public for months, thanks to court filings from the Justice Department.\n\nThis all shows how the various investigations -- by the January 6 committee, other congressional panels, the Justice Department, and state prosecutors in Georgia -- are overlapping and criss-crossing.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Stephen Ayres' last name.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen", "Jeremy Herb", "Zachary Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/media/abortion-debate-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "Authorities confirm story about 10-year-old rape victim as abortion ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nTwo newspapers owned by Gannett, one in Indiana and one in Ohio, have humanized the new American reality about abortion now that Roe v. Wade has been reversed. And in doing so, they have highlighted the inhumanity of some partisan punditry.\n\nOn July 1, the Indianapolis Star reported that a 10-year-old girl in Ohio was pregnant, and because \"the Buckeye state had outlawed any abortion after six weeks,\" the girl was brought to Indiana for an abortion. The source was Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Indianapolis, who said she had conferred with a child abuse doctor in Ohio.\n\nNo further details about the girl or the alleged rapist were obtainable, even though some news outlets tried. In recent days, after President Biden cited the news report and denounced Ohio's abortion ban, many conservative media outlets and Republican office-holders poured skepticism on the case, and some personalities flatly said they did not believe the 10-year-old existed. Rep. Jim Jordan tweeted: \"Another lie. Anyone surprised?\"\n\nYou know what's coming next. On Wednesday, the Columbus Dispatch reported that a man has been charged in the case. Police say Gerson Fuentes, 27, \"confessed to raping the child on at least two occasions.\"\n\nNone of the media outlets that sowed doubt about the case were in court for the arraignment. Hardly any of them were even in the state. The Dispatch's Bethany Bruner said she was the \"only reporter in the courtroom\" when it happened. \"This confirms that the case exists,\" she wrote on Twitter, sharing the link to her story.\n\nBruner said the Dispatch relied on public records to track down Fuentes. It's \"fitting,\" Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple said , \"that perhaps the biggest abortion story since the SCOTUS overturning of Roe v. Wade stems from regional/local newspapers, because that's where the reporting on this issue will be playing out for months and years. A brand-new test for a hollowed-out American media sector.\"\n\nThe doubters and deniers\n\nRight-wing skepticism about the case bubbled up on social media last week and boiled over after Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler wrote abou t the difficulty in confirming Bernard's account. On Monday Fox's Jesse Watters hosted Ohio's Republican A.G. Dave Yost, who said there was \"not a whisper\" of any evidence that such a crime occurred. Up until Wednesday morning, \"Yost was on a media tour casting doubt on the veracity of the story,\" and criticizing the Indianapolis Star, Vice's Paul Blest wrote . Segments on Fox also heaped suspicion on the Star's story. The WSJ's editorial board called it an \"unlikely story from a biased source that neatly fits the progressive narrative but can't be confirmed,\" adding, \"PJ Media's Megan Fox was first to point this out.\"\n\nOnce the Dispatch reported on the suspect's arrest, Fox came up with other reasons to blast the media , and Watters credited his show with putting on \"the pressure\" to find the suspect, adding, \"we are glad that justice is being served.\" He plastered Bernard's photo on screen and accused her of participating in a coverup. Then his guest attacked the Indy Star and its \"abortionist movement.\" One hour later, Tucker Carlson strongly implied that the identity of the suspect was shrouded in secrecy because, in Carlson's words, \"apparently the rapist was an illegal alien.\" The suspect's immigration status is now the focus of right-wing media coverage.\n\nThere are so many untold stories\n\nFor more on this awful episode, check out NPR's new report by David Folkenflik and Sarah McCammon. They wrote that it \"illustrates the high stakes of both the new legal landscape on abortion and of reporting in an age of deep political polarization and mistrust of major news outlets.\"\n\nThe Dispatch is ready. Wednesday's story by Bruner and her colleagues Monroe Trombly and Tony Cook not only contains critical details from the courtroom, it includes the broader context that everyone on every side of the reproductive rights debate needs to face. Like this: \"An analysis of Columbus police reports filed since May 9 found 50 reports of rape or sexual abuse involving girls 15 years or younger.\"\n\nThat's a report almost every single day, in just one metro area, and certainly a partial count -- underscoring a vast number of untold stories. The Dispatch story also notes that \"the ability of Ohio residents to seek abortion services in Indiana could soon be curtailed,\" since Republican lawmakers in the state are expected to enact new restrictions later this summer.\n\nA 10 year old is being treated \"as a political chess piece\"\n\nEditorial writers and TV talking heads will move on tomorrow, but the people at the center of this case will be changed forever.\n\nWashington Post columnist Alyssa Rosenberg made a really important point here : \"Even if the girl in Ohio remains anonymous — and the national media attention, the arrest of her alleged rapist and his naming in the press make that seem unlikely — she will someday know that her 10-year-old self was treated not as a person the whole nation had an interest in protecting, but as a political chess piece.\" Shame on the nation, she says, \"that put a 10-year-old in the worst possible circumstances through an unnecessary ordeal, and then argued about whether she was a hoax.\"\n\nCorrection: Sarah McCammon's name was misspelled in a previous version of this story.", "authors": ["Analysis Brian Stelter", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/politics/reshaping-politics-roe-v-wade/index.html", "title": "A stunning moment in American history decades in the making will ...", "text": "The Supreme Court's overturning of a woman's right to an abortion on Friday was a legal, political and societal thunderbolt that merits the overused term \"historic\" because it will change life in multiple ways, many still unknown.\n\nBut while shocking, especially since it goes against majority public opinion on the issue, it was not a surprise. The ruling was the result of a staggeringly successful generational quest by the conservative movement at all political levels, from grassroots social and religious activists through the founding leaders of a right-wing legal establishment to successive Republican presidents.\n\nDemocrats working through phases of disbelief, fury and pain on Friday vowed to fight back. But their mission, like that of their conservative vanquishers, could last decades or even longer in pursuit of a distant goal.\n\n\"Make no mistake: This decision is the culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law. It's a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court,\" President Joe Biden said . But he added: \"This is not over.\"\n\nAnother top Democrat, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said she was \"spitting mad.\"\n\n\"We've got tools. We're going to use them in November. We're going to make sure that we elect enough people who believe in democracy that we can pass Roe v.

MUST WATCH 'I'm spitting mad': Elizabeth Warren shares anger over ruling in interview 03:52\n\nBut the generational nature of the struggle to come means it's not likely to be septuagenarians like Biden and Warren who win it.\n\nThe prospects of an immediate political riposte are also unlikely, given the Democrats' current political woes. If the outpouring of liberal emotion is to coalesce into a counter-movement to restore abortion rights, it will require the same level of multi-decade dedication shown by conservatives. It will call for a network of political groups all pushing in the same direction and for national politicians with the talent to turn out voters on the issue using their time in office to build a competing legal and political structure effective at pressing change. And it will have to begin as a rearguard action after a stunning defeat as multiple conservative states pass or implement flash laws to outlaw abortion for millions of women.\n\nAbortion is a deeply personal issue for many Americans that involves choices about when life begins and an individual's rights to make a decision about their own body. It becomes a sensitive and divisive political issue when it comes to the questions of whether and how government can dictate these moral and legal questions and what the Constitution permits.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN commentator challenged on her religion and abortion stance.

See her response 06:32\n\nSo just as liberals may now be newly fired up, the anti-abortion movement will not rest. Some activists are already striving to elect a Republican-led Congress and president who would outlaw abortion not just in conservative states but also in the blue ones that immediately vowed Friday to protect a woman's right to choose. And while Biden can carp about Republican extremists and liberals complain about Republican presidents failing to win the popular vote, the conservative movement looks just as likely to mobilize to use the US political system to preserve its win as Democrats are to try to overturn it.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who did as much as any Republican leader to transform the Supreme Court, praised the years of conservative campaigning that had led to Friday's decision.\n\n\"Millions of Americans have spent half a century praying, marching and working toward today's historic victories for the rule of law and for innocent life. I have been proud to stand with them throughout our long journey and I share their joy today,\" the Kentucky Republican said.\n\nArkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted: \"... we are able now to protect life.\"\n\nA cascade of consequences\n\nFriday's victory was so total for conservatives and will be so difficult for Democrats to reverse not only because of its immediate legal consequence, but also because of the cascade of effects it will unleash, some not even connected to abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion activists are celebrating not just potentially millions of future pregnancies that will go to term, but a profound turn in the country's policies as well, which will change what it means to live in America for men as well as women.\n\nBut at the same time, tens of millions of women went to bed Friday evening with one fewer constitutional right than they had woken up with. As conservative states begin to outlaw abortion entirely, the ledger of Americans' rights will depend on where they live or conceive. For apparently the first time in the country's historic march, the Supreme Court has taken away a previously enshrined constitutional right. The starkly literal reading of the Constitution by the court's conservative majority in this case -- as well as in other judicial haymakers on guns and religion this week -- beckons an era of societal upheaval.\n\nIf one constitutional right can be wiped out, why not others? Already, and despite the assurances of several of the court's conservatives, same-sex marriage, contraception and even in vitro fertilization treatments are beginning to look more vulnerable.\n\nThis week's rulings on abortion and guns have cemented the court's new conservative majority as a staggeringly powerful force in American life -- one with the audacity to make far-reaching change. Because this upheaval comes from a bench of deeply religious conservatives, it is certain to trigger confrontations with more secular, diverse sectors of society. These factors, and the court's recent opinions conflicting with majority public opinion, mean that America's vicious ideological divide is all but certain to deepen. But the justices are insulated from politics by lifetime appointments.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'It's so startling': Joan Biskupic reacts to Roe v Wade overturn Replay More Videos ...

It validated the marriage of convenience between the ethically challenged former President and evangelicals and social conservatives, which was rooted in the promise that he would nominate anti-abortion justices.\n\nAnd it confirms McConnell, whose contentious maneuverings unlocked the path to the conservative majority, as one of the most meaningful political figures of all time. Trump and McConnell's work -- in the shape of three comparatively young justices -- will be changing the face of America for long after they are gone. The nature of the Senate, which allows Republicans to wield considerable power despite representing far fewer people in more rural states, will make it difficult for Democrats to transform majority opinion into a law codifying Roe v. Wade.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roe v. Wade is overturned. How does this affect you? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Roe v. Wade is overturned. How does this affect you? 02:02\n\nIn the short term, Friday's decision could play into the midterm elections in November, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed to turn on the abortion decision. But with voters hammered by high inflation and record gasoline prices, they may be focused on more pressing economic concerns -- especially in the places where Democrats need to make gains in order to hold on to their narrow majorities.\n\nThe new reality on abortion is certain to add even more intensity to the 2024 presidential campaign with Democrats facing the possibility of a Republican monopoly on power.\n\nAnd as they were in the pandemic, governors and state legislators will become vital players on a fearsomely divisive national issue, as some hurriedly pass laws to outlaw the right to end a pregnancy and others fight to preserve it. There are likely to be disputes over the power of states to stop residents seeking abortions from traveling to states where the procedure is still allowed.\n\nBig business is about to be embroiled in a fight over the rights of female employees that could affect the locations of headquarters and will require firms to consider how to deal with new health care conundrums. The conservative majority suggested in its opinion that sending abortion back to the states to decide will let democracy work it out. But nothing in the polarized state of American politics suggests this is anything more than wishful thinking. Abortion is likely to drive an already torn nation further into self-estrangement.\n\nA historic campaign to change America\n\nIn many ways, Friday's tumultuous events were the right's answer to an almost as epic summer week seven years ago, when the court seemed to launch a period of liberal ascendency by saving the Affordable Care Act and ruling that same-sex marriage was constitutional. Those heady few days, however, helped spark a backlash that led to Trump's presidency and, ultimately, to this week's momentous opinions.\n\nBut the genesis of this moment came long before, beginning to build soon after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision the court just overturned. It took a web of alliances and interlocking campaigns by religious conservatives, activist groups, fundraisers, grassroots lawmakers, faith leaders, anti-abortion marchers, national political leaders, talk radio hosts, right-wing media figures and Republican presidents over decades to come to fruition. It involved years of confirmations that turned the federal judiciary to the right, then de facto alliances between jurists and conservative politicians in the states to bring cases weakening and eventually ending the federal right to an abortion up through the courts.\n\nAnd it took Supreme Court nominees misleading Senate confirmation hearings, with a wink and a nod, on their opposition to overturning precedent to create the majority in the marble-pillared Supreme Court chamber that would finish the job.\n\nThe movement was especially energized by the conservative renaissance that President Ronald Reagan engineered. As California governor, he had signed a law allowing some exceptions to abortion but changed his views after a long period of soul searching and after spotting an opening to use the issue to electrify the conservative movement. In February 1984, Reagan wrote in his diary about a conversation with a woman in Peoria, Illinois, who had broken with Republicans because of his stance on the issue.\n\n\"I made my pitch that there were 2 people's rights involved in abortion — the mother's & the unborn child,\" Reagan wrote, spelling out a message that fortified the mission even after his death.\n\nThe next Republican president, George H.W. Bush, appointed Justice Clarence Thomas, who waited in silence for decades on the bench for his hardline conservative jurisprudence to dominate the court. He published a concurrent opinion on Friday that read like a rallying call for activists and conservative states to challenge other precedents, on same-sex marriage and contraception.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton kept conservatives at bay for eight years and his nominee, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, became an icon for women's rights during her long tenure. But her death in 2020, while Trump was in the White House, opened the way for a solidifying of the 5-4 conservative majority that overturned Roe on Friday.\n\nThe next President, George W. Bush, did his bit for an abortion earthquake still 17 years in the future by nominating Justice Samuel Alito, who penned Friday's majority opinion.\n\nThe Obama presidency featured then-Majority Leader McConnell's blockade of the President's final nominee, Merrick Garland (now Biden's attorney general), which allowed newly elected Trump to elevate another member of Friday's majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch. And then McConnell reversed his hastily created rule against confirming justices before elections, which he'd used to keep Garland off the court, to install another anti-abortion justice in Amy Coney Barrett days before Trump lost in 2020. Without his efforts, the fifth vote to reverse Roe would not have existed, since Chief Justice John Roberts, while opposing abortion, signaled support for a less radical course.\n\nJUST WATCHED OB-GYN explains the far-reaching effects of Roe ruling Replay More Videos ...

Their long haul will be complicated by the fact that Gorsuch, Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh are only in their 50s and figure to have years of service on the court in which to further solidify Friday's ruling.\n\nFor abortion rights activists, meanwhile, the next few presidential elections just got even more critical and will test whether complacency among liberals about the supposed inviolability of the right to end a pregnancy will begin to change.\n\nAlmost every Republican campaign, up and down the ballot, has long included a push for ending abortion.

Election workers counted more than 28,000 early ballots and showed them breaking favorably for Trump.\n\nMark Evans, the spokesperson for Pima County, said 14,484 of the early votes counted Thursday were cast for Trump, while 13,045 early ballots counted on Thursday were cast for Biden. That’s a 1,400 net gain for Trump as he has narrowed Biden's lead statewide.\n\nEvans said Pima County still has 9,000 remaining early ballots that need to be tabulated, as well as 18,000 provisional ballots.\n\nThe county recorder has begun the process of verifying those provisional ballots, he added.\n\nBallots from smaller counties came in batches over the course of the day, with votes in right-leaning counties breaking for the president.\n\nCochise, Yavapai, Mohave and Pinal counties all posted results batches that strongly favored Trump. Coconino County’s ballots posted Thursday slightly favored Biden.

Mahoney in a scheduling hearing asked attorneys representing a voter and poll worker concerned about the use of Sharpies and attorneys representing county officials to discuss how quickly they could move forward with the case, considering the county is nearly finished processing ballots and counting votes.\n\nThomas Liddy, a county attorney, explained to the judge that Sharpies were fine to use to fill out ballots, and asked the judge to dismiss the case because \"the voters have a right to know that the allegations flying around the Internet about Sharpies being dropped from black helicopters to cheat people out of their votes is fake. It's not true, but it's really scaring people. We need to resolve this issue once and for all.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. intervened in the court case against county officials, with elections attorney Kory Langhofer asking the judge to allow members of the public who were concerned about Sharpie use to watch the counting of ballots.\n\nLiddy said that anyone can watch the counting of ballots on the county's website, but he didn't understand how that would help, since it's mostly early ballots being counted, not the ones that were already processed and counted in person on Election Day.\n\nThe judge did not make any decisions on the parties' requests in the case. Liddy said that he was interested in filing a motion to dismiss the case on behalf of the parties, and Alexander Kolodin, the attorney representing the county resident and poll worker, said that he wanted the case to go to a hearing soon.\n\nThe resident in the case, Laurie Aguilera, is claiming that, while voting in person at a vote center on Tuesday, the \"ballot box failed to properly register her vote\" after poll workers gave her a Sharpie to fill out her ballot, and then a poll worker who had consulted with the Maricopa County Recorder's Office refused to provide her a new ballot.\n\nJoshua Banko, the poll worker in the case, is claiming he was working as an elections clerk at Paradise Valley Mall in Phoenix and most voters there experienced issues with the ballot tabulating machines all day that he assumed were because of the use of Sharpies.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n5:15 p.m.: Faith leaders denounce Wednesday protest as another begins\n\nTwo Arizona faith groups issued a statement on Thursday denouncing the more than 100 protesters — including members of the extremist group AZ Patriots — who showed up at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix demanding they be allowed to oversee the vote-counting process.\n\nValley Interfaith Project and Arizona Interfaith Network released a joint statement saying they recognized frustrations at the prolonged ballot-counting process, but that threatening election officials was unacceptable.\n\n“The unwarranted provocation, aided and abetted by fringe group extremists, is an affront to the democratic process,” the statement read. “The belligerent tone of the gathering clearly was intended to intimidate election officials and observers, creating an unsettled atmosphere and perhaps sanctioning future uprisings and potential violence.”\n\nThough no skirmishes occurred between the Trump supporters and the Maricopa County Sheriff deputies who barred them from entering, several supporters were armed with guns. Right-wing extremist Mike Cernovich and Rep. Paul Gosar tweeted on Thursday asking people to protest outside the election center once again but leave the firearms at home.\n\n“I know it’s your right in Arizona but I am against open carry and ask you not do that,” Cernovich said in a tweet. Gosar suggested on Twitter that people bring flags and bibles instead.\n\nOn Thursday, fencing was installed throughout part of the election center’s parking lot with the exterior being a designated “free speech zone.” Deputies allowed protesters to gather just before the steps leading to the building’s entrance on Wednesday evening.\n\n— Perry Vandell\n\n4:30 p.m.: When to expect the next rounds of ballot results\n\nAll those watching and waiting for Maricopa County's next rounds of ballot results should have an earlier night tonight.\n\nThe county expects to post a round of results at 7 p.m. Thursday and 9 a.m. Friday.\n\nThe move to push results in the morning instead of late at night comes after results were released at about 1 a.m. Thursday. Protesters supporting Trump gathered outside the county tabulation location last night while the ballot drops were awaited.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n3:40 p.m.: County sets up free speech zone outside elections office\n\nA free speech zone was set up Thursday outside the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in downtown Phoenix in anticipation for additional protests.\n\nThe free speech zone would allow for people to protest while ensuring elections staff could “do their jobs and leave the building without the threat of intimidation,” said a tweet from the Maricopa County Elections Department.\n\n“The eyes of the nation are on Maricopa County and its imperative that we balance the protection and well-being of our election workers and volunteers with the constitutional right of protesters who may wish to demonstrate outside the Elections Department,” the tweet said.\n\nIn coordination with the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, the zone was set up outside the center at 510 S. Third Avenue.\n\n— Chelsea Curtis\n\n3:20 p.m.: Are we just going to be known for Sharpies now?\n\nOne more thing about Sharpies: The website Sharpiegate.com now directs to a fundraising page for the Biden Victory Fund.\n\n“DONATE TO DEFEAT TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS,” the website says.\n\n“The latest polls show Joe Biden with a narrow lead over Donald Trump in key swing states that will decide who wins the White House. Joe and Democrats across the country are counting on your support to help them defeat Trump's allies up and down the ballot,” it says.\n\nThe website is run by ActBlue, a fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and progressive groups.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n3 p.m.: Here's an update on all the latest Sharpie news\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Thursday that he has no evidence to suggest there are any issues with the use of Sharpies at polling places, despite his office’s letter to Maricopa County elections officials questioning the practice.\n\n\"Do I think based on what I've heard now and what I've seen that maybe this was a little overblown? I think that I will, at this point, say that I will believe what the election officials have said verbally and take them at their word,\" Brnovich said in an interview with 12 News reporter Joe Dana, posted on Twitter.\n\nThe attorney general said he did not think anyone in Arizona was intentionally creating controversy or conspiracy.\n\n\"At the end of the day, think about this, if indeed there was an issue with Sharpies, I mean, I'm not a math whiz, but that would have affected both parties equally,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, the Maricopa County Elections Department responded on Thursday to Brnovich’s investigation of the use of Sharpies on ballots in the state, through a letter from the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe letter answered the Attorney General’s questions regarding Sharpie use and rejected ballots, and explained that Sharpies are the pens that the ballot tabulation machine manufacturer recommends.\n\n“Maricopa County’s ballots are designed in such a way that any “bleed through” caused by the ink cannot create false votes or cause a voter’s intended vote to be miscounted,” the letter states.\n\nPoll workers gave out Sharpies at all 175 vote centers, and they“should have been used” been all voters, according to the letter. If something was wrong with a ballot causing it to not be read properly by the voting machine, the voting machine would alert the voter, and the voter was given the option of casting a new ballot.\n\nThe county is currently doing a post-election analysis to see how many of these “spoiled” ballots there were during this election, according to the letter, and will be completed prior to when votes are finalized.\n\n— Jen Fifield and Andrew Oxford\n\n2:30 p.m.: Trump campaign not suing over Arizona count\n\nAt a Trump campaign press conference on Thursday afternoon, Republican officials made clear they believe Arizona will be decided in Trump’s favor once all ballots are counted, delivering 11 electoral votes to Trump. But they didn’t have much to announce at the news briefing.\n\nVotes counted in the past few ballot updates have trended in Trump’s favor, though it remains unclear if the president can make up the ground and catch up with Joe Biden in Arizona. The national map remains unsettled, with no candidate getting 270 electoral votes yet.\n\nTrump campaign adviser David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, said he won’t be announcing any legal challenges in Arizona now. The campaign has filed lawsuits in other battleground states in the last 48 hours.\n\n“There’s been no decisions on anything as of yet, but absolutely all options are on the table to protect every single legal vote that has been made in Arizona,” he said.\n\nBossie and other Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, former Arizona Treasurer Jeff DeWit and Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward, told the crowd of Trump supporters gathered at the Arizona Republican Party headquarters on Thursday that the GOP would prove media organizations who called the race for Biden wrong.\n\n“We have the team on the ground. We have the people. We have the momentum. We have the activist community that is not going to allow this race to be stolen from President Trump or from Republicans all the way down the ballot,” Ward said.\n\nThe news conference was brief and included little news. It served more to rally ardent Trump supporters who showed up.\n\nAfter quick remarks from Lesko, Ward said anyone with questions about voter fraud could come up and talk to officials. A flock of people took her up on it.\n\n— Maria Polletta and Rachel Leingang\n\n2 p.m.: Secretary of State slams AG letter on Sharpies\n\nThe Arizona Secretary of State’s Office issued a scathing response on Thursday to Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s investigation of the use of Sharpies on ballots in the state.\n\nIn a letter to the Attorney General’s Office, State Elections Director Sambo Dul wrote that she hopes that the information her office provided would stop the attorney general from \"perpetuating a conspiracy theory that undermines the hard work of Arizona's election administrators, poll workers and voters.\"\n\n“The Secretary is committed to overseeing a fair election and dispelling misinformation that would make that job more difficult for state and county election officials,” Dul wrote. “She sincerely hopes that the Attorney General shares that same goal, and will join an ever-growing chorus of public officials and media sources that have correctly labeled what is now being referred to as 'SharpieGate' as the unfounded conspiracy theory that it is.”\n\nBrnovich began investigating after his office heard concerns from voters that the use of Sharpies on ballots caused their votes not to count.\n\nElection officials have reassured voters that it was OK to use Sharpies to fill out ballots.\n\n\"First, inherent in your questions is the false assumption that using Sharpies on a ballot causes ballots to be rejected, spoiled, or canceled,\" Dul wrote. \"That is simply not true, as the Maricopa County Elections Department and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors has publicly explained.\"\n\n— Andrew Oxford\n\n1:30 p.m.: Trump campaign calls Arizona press conference\n\nThe Trump campaign called a press conference in Arizona at 2 p.m. Thursday at Arizona Republican Party headquarters.\n\nThe press conference will feature U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, former Arizona Treasurer Jeff DeWit, Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward David Bossie, the president of Citizens United.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n1 p.m.: Trump supporters plan evening protest, county continues counting\n\nRepublican protesters concerned about their votes not being counted in Tuesday’s election made plans to meet up again at the Maricopa County Elections Department headquarters in downtown Phoenix on Thursday night.\n\nProtesters gathered outside of the headquarters, where county workers are counting remaining early ballots, on Wednesday night, and outside of Phoenix City Hall on Thursday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Megan Gilbertson, a department spokesperson, said the protesting has not disturbed the continued counting of ballots. There were about 282,000 in Maricopa County, including 18,000 provisional votes, remaining as of Thursday morning and the county had an original goal of counting all ballots by Nov. 10.\n\nGilbertson said that the county has not seen a need to increase security at the elections department, considering the Sheriff’s Department has already been providing security at the headquarters since the election began.\n\nThe election’s department shares the building with the sheriff’s department, so law enforcement is always present at the building, she said.\n\nElection staff that helps with ballot processing and counting is shuttled to and from the building, so there are not concerns about their safety as they come and go from the building, Gilbertson said.\n\nCounty elections officials had a fence installed around headquarters on Thursday morning in preparation for the protests.\n\nProtesters began gathering this week after concerns that the use of Sharpies on Arizona ballots made it so votes were not counted properly. County elections officials continued to reassure voters that Sharpies were fine to use and the county’s machines can read ballots filled out with Sharpies, even if the ink bleeds through the page.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n12:30 p.m.: What is ballot curing?\n\nAs votes continue to be counted in Arizona, the normal process of ballot \"curing\" was also underway as election officials attempt to reach voters with errors on their ballots.\n\nWhen counties receive a ballot with a signature that does not match the voter’s signature on record, the county will attempt to contact the voter to confirm their ballot in a process called \"curing.\"\n\nArizona law says voters whose mail-in ballot has a mismatched signature have five business days after Election Day to fix and submit their ballot. In Maricopa County, election officials aimed \"to have 99% of all valid ballots counted and reported by the end of the cure period,\" listed as 5 p.m. Nov. 10, according to their plan.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes during the 2018 election said in the process of verifying signatures, the county will attempt to contact the voter using the phone number and email on file with the voter’s registration.\n\nHe said the county will call multiple times, leave the voter a voicemail and send an email in an attempt to get in contact with the voter.\n\nWhile county officials try to verify the signature on the green envelopes that contain a voter’s ballot, they occasionally come across an envelope with no signature at all.\n\nVoters can check on the status of their ballot using the state elections site, my.arizona.vote.\n\n— BrieAnna Frank and Julian Alberto Hernandez\n\n11:45 a.m.: Sheriff’s candidate page shares petition asking for recount\n\nJerry Sheridan, the Republican candidate for Maricopa County sheriff, shared a White House petition on his Facebook account asking that there be a recount of ballots in Arizona. The petition says it was started Wednesday by someone who identifies as R.P.\n\nIt was signed by more than 144,000 people as of Thursday, the petition shows.\n\nThe petition says Arizona “was called too soon.” Election officials in the state are still counting ballots, and no count has been finalized.\n\nSheridan, who is behind incumbent Sheriff Paul Penzone in the latest vote count by 14 percentage points, also shared on his Facebook the debunked conspiracy theory that people who voted in person using Sharpie pens may have their ballots invalidated.\n\n“I was unaware an administrator with access to my Campaign Facebook page posted this. It has since been removed because I do not have an opinion on this issue either way. I need more information,” Sheridan told The Republic in a written statement.\n\n\"I would disagree that it has been debunked however. Unless and until it has been determined by the Arizona Attorney General that the use of Sharpies did not interfere with the election process I will form no opinion on this issue either way. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.”\n\n— Uriel Garcia\n\n11:30 a.m.: Pro-Trump supporters rally in front of Phoenix City Hall\n\nSeveral dozen people gathered in front of Phoenix City Hall on Thursday morning to support Donald Trump and demand that elections officials count all votes.\n\nAbout 50 to 60 people and news media members were seen shortly before 11 a.m. in front of City Hall, at 200 W. Washington St.\n\nA rally was planned for 6 p.m. in front of the Maricopa County Elections Department, where protesters gathered Wednesday night to demand that election workers keep counting votes.\n\n10:45 a.m.: Pima County keeps counting, scraps plans for pause\n\nElection officials in Arizona’s second most populous county scrapped plans on Thursday morning to put a pause on the tabulation of outstanding ballots and have since said they will continue counting 22,000 votes throughout the day. But it remained unclear whether they would finish counting them all by the end of Thursday, and the county still has an additional 23,000 ballots left to verify and tabulate.\n\nMark Evans, the spokesperson for Pima County, said the director for the county’s Elections Department had initially intended to pause the counting of ballots in order to finish the signature verification process for all outstanding early ballots and then count them on Friday morning.\n\n“But clearly the urgency of this election and the role that Arizona is playing argued against that, and so the county administrator this morning asked the election director to continue counting today,” Evans said.\n\nThe process to count them would take some time, he added. The county recorder must first verify signatures on all early ballots. The elections department then has to remove the ballots from the envelopes, examine them for any issues, and prepare them to get counted.\n\nThe Pima County Elections Department has about 40 employees preparing the ballots to be tabulated and nine that are counting the ballots.\n\nThey have also been using machines to speed up the process.\n\n“We will have ballots to count, whether it’s the entire 22,000 depends upon the speed of the election boards and whether they can get them all ready to be tabulated,” Evans said. “They will get some of them done, hopefully all of them.”\n\nPima County counted about 5400 votes on Wednesday and posted the results that afternoon. But there are still between 5,000-8,000 early ballots and 18,000 provisional ballots that still need to be verified and counted. Evans said the county will not begin processing and counting the provisional ballots until all early ballots are tabulated.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n10:15 a.m.: Schweikert widens lead in 6th Congressional District\n\nRep.

These rumors were dispelled by election officials on Wednesday.\n\nLawyers sued Fontes on behalf of a woman claiming that when she attempted to vote using the felt-tipped pen provided at the poll, \"the ballot box failed to properly register her vote causing a poll worker to cancel her ballot,\" according to court documents.\n\nWhen she requested a new ballot, the lawsuit alleged, the poll workers refused after consulting the Recorder's Office.\n\n\"Upon information and belief, many other voters have experienced similar issues,\" the documents said.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court ordered both the plaintiff and Fontes appear virtually at 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a hearing to show cause, or to explain or prove claims the judge needs to make a decision.\n\n— Emily Wilder\n\n7:30 a.m.: Trump makes up ground on Biden\n\nAs Maricopa County released the results from 140,000 more ballots on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, President Donald Trump received almost the exact share he would need to charge back to win Arizona's 11 electoral votes and potentially reelection.\n\nTrump won the batches of ballots from Maricopa County counted Wednesday and early Thursday by a roughly 57-40 margin over former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThose votes — likely early ballots sent to the county on Monday and Tuesday — narrowed Biden's lead over Trump in Arizona to 68,000 votes, when his lead had been more than 90,000 votes earlier Wednesday.\n\nPaul Bentz, a Republican pollster with the consulting firm HighGround, said Trump needs to win 57.6% of the 470,000 votes that The Arizona Republic estimates remain to be counted.\n\n\"That's almost exactly what he got in the first batch,\" Bentz said. \"He could do it.\"\n\n— Rob O'Dell\n\nHere are things you should know about how your ballot makes it through the tabulation process and how to check to see if your ballot was counted.\n\nHow can I be sure my early ballot was counted?

It was hard to ignore the fierce online embrace of Depp or the vitriol directed at Heard. It became clear that the trial wasn't just about which Hollywood actor was to be believed --— it was, in part, a proxy for a broader culture war over the \"Me Too\" movement.\n\nOn Wednesday, a jury of five men and two women dealt a victory to Depp in his defamation case against Heard, his ex-wife. Heard, for her part, prevailed in part of her counterclaim against Depp. Depp charged that Heard had falsely and maliciously accused him of domestic abuse, costing him millions in damages from lost acting jobs after an opinion piece attributed to Heard was published by The Washington Post in 2018. While the piece didn't name Depp directly, Heard described herself as a \"public figure representing domestic abuse.\"\n\nThe verdict rapidly made its way across social media platforms, with some conservative pundits such as Ann Coulter and Meghan McCain declaring the death of #MeToo.

Among the preparations was a small-scale model of Zawahiri's safe house, constructed by intelligence officials and placed inside the White House Situation Room for Biden to examine as he debated his options.\n\nFor Biden, the opportunity to take out the world's most wanted terrorist, one of the masterminds of the September, 11, 2001, attacks, was fraught with the risk of accidentally killing civilians in the Afghan capital — just as a US drone strike did 11 months ago during the chaotic US military withdrawal from the country.\n\nHow al-Zawahiri met bin Laden and became the leader of al Qaeda\n\nHow al-Zawahiri met bin Laden and became the leader of al Qaeda 03:41\n\nHow al-Zawahiri met bin Laden and became the leader of al Qaeda\n\nDetails of the strike and its planning were disclosed by a senior administration official as Biden was preparing to announce the mission Monday.\n\nThroughout the months-long effort to plan this weekend's strike, Biden repeatedly tasked his officials with ensuring civilians -- including members of Zawahiri's family -- weren't killed. None were, according to the White House.\n\nBiden, who was isolating due to a Covid-19 infection during the final deliberations and authorization of the strike, emerged to proclaim success on a White House balcony Monday. It was a moment of victory for a President who has been besieged by domestic political troubles that stretch back to the deadly Afghanistan withdrawal a year ago.\n\n\"People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer. The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm,\" Biden said from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House.\n\nThe President was first briefed in April on US intelligence placing Zawahiri at a safe house in Kabul. American officials had been aware of a network supporting the terrorist leader in the Afghan capital for months, and had identified his wife, daughter and her children through multiple streams of intelligence.\n\nThe women utilized terrorist \"tradecraft\" that officials deemed designed to prevent anyone from following them to Zawahiri's location in a Kabul neighborhood. Zawahiri himself didn't leave the location after his arrival this year.\n\nAs the months wore on, US officials began to establish patterns at the house — including Zawahiri emerging periodically onto the home's balcony for sustained periods of time.\n\nAs officials continued to monitor his activities, an effort began in complete secret to analyze the building's construction and structure, with an eye toward developing an operation to take out the world's No. 1 terrorist target without compromising the building's structural integrity.\n\nAt top of mind for Biden and members of his team was avoiding civilian deaths, including the members of Zawahiri's family who were living in the building. Independent analysts from across the government were involved in identifying the other occupants of the house.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former CIA director explains what it takes for targeted drone strikes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Former CIA director explains what it takes for targeted drone strikes 01:20\n\nThat the building was located in downtown Kabul presented its own challenges.\n\nSurrounded by a residential neighborhood, officials were mindful their planning and information needed to be \"rock solid\" before presenting any options to Biden. And they were highly wary of leaks -- only a \"very small and select group\" at a scattering of key agencies were informed of the plans being laid.\n\nBiden was also concerned about how it might affect US efforts to secure the return of Mark Frerichs, an American citizen taken hostage in Afghanistan more than two years ago. A senior administration official said Biden pressed his team to mitigate risks to those efforts, along with the ongoing attempts to relocate Afghans who helped the US during the war.\n\n\"Going forward with the Taliban, we will continue to hold them accountable for their actions. And we have made clear to them in the intervening days that we also expect them to take no action that would harm Mark Frerichs, as we were involved in the effort to secure his release after his long detention and captivity,\" the official said.\n\nAs May and June wore on, Biden was kept abreast of the developments. On July 1, he gathered key national security officials in the White House Situation Room to receive a briefing on a proposed operation. CIA Director Bill Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his deputy Jon Finer, and Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood Randall sat around the table.\n\nBiden was \"deeply engaged in the briefing and immersed in the intelligence,\" a senior official said. He asked \"detailed questions about what we knew and how we knew it.\"\n\nOf particular interest was a scale model of Zawahiri's house that intelligence officials had constructed and brought into the White House for the President to examine. Biden questioned how the house might be lit by the sun, its construction materials and how the weather could affect any operation, the official said.\n\n\"He was particularly focused on ensuring that every step had been taken to ensure the operation would minimize that risk\" of civilian casualties, according to the official.\n\nBiden asked his team for more information about the building's plans and how a strike might affect it. He flew to Camp David later that afternoon.\n\nHis team remained behind, convening multiple times in the Situation Room over the next weeks to complete their planning, answer the President's questions and ensure they'd taken every contingency to minimize risks.\n\nA parallel effort by senior administration lawyers was underway to examine the intelligence related to Zawahiri and establish the legal basis for the operation.\n\nJUST WATCHED Al Qaeda expert has theory on why al-Zawahiri was killed Replay More Videos ...

He again pressed at a \"granular level,\" the official said, asking about any additional options that could minimize civilian casualties.\n\nHe asked about the layout of the house -- where the rooms were positioned behind windows and doors on the third floor -- and what potential effect the strike would have.\n\nAnd he went around his team, asking each official's view.\n\nAt the end, he authorized a \"precise tailored airstrike\" to take out the target.\n\nFive days later, two Hellfire missiles were fired into the balcony of the safe house in Kabul at 6:18 a.m. local time. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN's Brianna Keilar on \"New Day\" that the US has \"visual confirmation\" as well as confirmation from \"other sources and methods,\" but not DNA confirmation, that the strike hit its intended target.\n\nMembers of his family, who were in other areas of the home, were unharmed, the official said.\n\nBiden, still isolating in the White House residence with a rebound Covid infection, was informed when the operation began and when it concluded.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/joe-biden-counter-terrorism/index.html", "title": "Afghanistan: US kills al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in drone ...", "text": "(CNN) The United States killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike, President Joe Biden said Monday in a speech from the White House.\n\n\"I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield, once and for all,\" Biden said.\n\nZawahiri, who just turned 71 years old, had remained a visible international symbol of the group, 11 years after the US killed Osama bin Laden. At one point, he acted as bin Laden's personal physician.\n\nZawahiri was sheltering in downtown Kabul to reunite with his family, Biden said, and was killed in what a senior administration official described as \"a precise tailored airstrike\" using two Hellfire missiles. The drone strike was conducted at 9:48 p.m. ET on Saturday was authorized by Biden following weeks of meetings with his Cabinet and key advisers, the official said on Monday, adding that no American personnel were on the ground in Kabul at the time of the strike.\n\nSenior Haqqani Taliban figures were aware of Zawahiri's presence in the area, the official said, in \"clear violation of the Doha agreement,\" and even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday's successful strike, restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children, who were intentionally not targeted during the strike and remained unharmed. The US did not alert Taliban officials ahead of Saturday's strike.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, \"An air strike was carried out on a residential house in Sherpur area of Kabul city on July 31.\"\n\nHe said, \"The nature of the incident was not apparent at first\" but the security and intelligence services of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and \"initial findings determined that the strike was carried out by an American drone.\"\n\nThe tweets by Mujahid came out prior to CNN reporting Zawahiri's death. Mujahid said the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan \"strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.\"\n\n'Justice has been delivered'\n\nBiden, who was kept abreast of the strike against Zawahiri as he isolated with a rebound case of Covid-19, spoke outdoors Monday from the Blue Room Balcony at the White House.\n\nZawahiri, Biden said, \"was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11, one of the most responsible for the attacks that murdered 2,977 people on American soil. For decades, he was the mastermind of attacks against Americans.\"\n\n\"Now, justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer,\" he continued. \"The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm. We make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.\"\n\nThe President said the precision strike targeting was the result of the \"extraordinary persistence and skill\" of the nation's intelligence community.\n\n\"Our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year -- he moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family,\" Biden said.\n\nThe strike comes one year after Biden ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, prompting Taliban forces to rapidly seize control of the nation.\n\nBiden said on Monday that when he withdrew US troops from the country, he \"made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm, and I made a promise to the American people, that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond. We've done just that.\"\n\nBiden pledged that Zawahiri \"will never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven, because he is gone and we're going to make sure that nothing else happens.\"\n\nThe President concluded by expressing gratitude to US intelligence and counterterrorism communities, saying that he hopes Zawahiri's death will bring some measure of closure to the friends and families of 9/11 victims.\n\n\"To those who continue to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act -- and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe,\" he concluded.\n\nEmbarrassment for Taliban\n\nA senior counterterrorism analyst told CNN that it would have been impossible for Zawahiri to be in Kabul without the invitation and acquiescence of at least a small number of Taliban, whether from the Haqqani network or another part of the group.\n\nThe analyst said that this strike was embarrassing for the Taliban as they had claimed there were no foreign fighters in Afghanistan and no al Qaeda.\n\nHe added that recent statements from Zawahiri had suggested the al Qaeda leader was feeling more relaxed. The statements had referred to more recent events, the analyst said, adding this potentially revealed a complacency that may have led to the successful strike.\n\nThe issue now arises as to who will be Zawahiri's successor.\n\nThe current al Qaeda No. 2, Saif al Adel, is thought to have been in Iran, according to United Nations reports.\n\nThe analyst said that this raised an urgent issue for the Iranians who now have to choose between expelling the new al Qaeda leader or harboring him.\n\nA former official in the Afghan government with an intimate grasp of counterterrorism said that he had heard al Adel had already left Iran for Afghanistan.\n\nClose ally of bin Laden\n\nHe eventually helped to mastermind the deadliest terror attack on American soil, when hijackers turned US airliners into missiles.\n\n\"Those 19 brothers who went out and gave their souls to Allah almighty, God almighty has granted them this victory we are enjoying now,\" al-Zawahiri said in a videotaped message released in April 2002.\n\nIt was the first of many taunting messages the terrorist -- who became al Qaeda's leader after US forces killed bin Laden in 2011 -- would send out over the years, urging militants to continue the fight against America and chiding US leaders.\n\nZawahiri was constantly on the move once the US-led invasion of Afghanistan began after the September 11, 2001, attacks. At one point, he narrowly escaped a US onslaught in the rugged, mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, an attack that left his wife and children dead.\n\nHe made his public debut as a Muslim militant when he was in prison for his involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.\n\n\"We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? Who are we?\" he said in a jailhouse interview.\n\nBy that time, al-Zawahiri, a young doctor, was already a committed terrorist who conspired to overthrow the Egyptian government for years and sought to replace it with fundamentalist Islamic rule. He proudly endorsed Sadat's assassination after the Egyptian leader made peace with Israel.\n\nHe spent three years in prison after Sadat's assassination and claimed he was tortured while in detention. After his release, he made his way to Pakistan, where he treated wounded mujahadeen fighters who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nThat was when he met bin Laden and found a common cause.\n\n\"We are working with brother bin Laden,\" he said in announcing the merger of his terror group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, with al Qaeda in May 1998. \"We know him since more than 10 years now. We fought with him here in Afghanistan.\"\n\nTogether, the two terror leaders signed a fatwa, or declaration: \"The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim.\"\n\nMastermind of 9/11\n\nThe attacks against the US and its facilities began weeks later, with the suicide bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 5,000 others. Zawahiri and bin Laden gloated after they escaped a US cruise missile attack in Afghanistan that had been launched in retaliation.\n\nThen, there was the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, when suicide bombers on a dinghy detonated their boat, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39 others.\n\nThe culmination of Zawahiri's terror plotting came on September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, headed for Washington, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back.\n\nSince then, al-Zawahiri raised his public profile, appearing on numerous video and audiotapes to urge Muslims to join the jihad against the United States and its allies. Some of his tapes were followed closely by terrorist attacks.\n\nIn May 2003, for instance, almost simultaneous suicide bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, killed 23 people, including nine Americans, days after a tape thought to contain Zawahiri's voice was released.\n\n9/11 families group expresses gratitude but calls on Biden to hold Saudis accountable\n\nTerry Strada, the chair of 9/11 Families United -- a coalition of survivors and families of victims of the September, 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- expressed gratitude for the strike, but called on the President to hold the Saudi Arabian government accountable for alleged government complicity in the attacks.\n\nThe group has criticized the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour , which began its third competition at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster at the end of July -- some 50 miles from Ground Zero in Manhattan.\n\n\"I am deeply grateful for the commitment of intelligence agencies and our brave military's dedication and sacrifices made in removing such evil from our lives. But, in order to achieve full accountability for the murder of thousands on Sept. 11, 2001, President Biden must also hold responsible the Saudi paymasters who bankrolled the Attacks,\" Strada said in a statement.\n\n\"The financiers are not being targeted by drones, they are being met with fist pumps and hosted at golf clubs. If we're going to be serious about accountability, we must hold EVERYONE accountable,\" Strada added -- appearing to reference the President's controversial gesture with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak", "Kylie Atwood", "Natasha Bertrand", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Nick Paton Walsh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/world/zawahiri-death-settles-9-11-score-biden-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Zawahiri death settles another 9/11 score -- and hands ...", "text": "(CNN) For a few hours, America's first war of the 21st century -- the war on terror -- returned to supersede the stirrings of a geopolitical showdown set to dominate the coming decades: a super power face-off with China .\n\nIn a blast from a previous foreign policy era, the US announced Monday that it had killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in Afghanistan, settling one of the last outstanding debts of vengeance after the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nMore broadly, the attack, which hearkens back to the war on terror but coincides with a moment of soaring US tensions with Beijing, underscores a profound pivot in US national security policy.\n\nAt one time, finding terrorists who attacked America wherever they were hiding was the organizing principle of Washington's approach to the world. While Monday's news was a \"mission accomplished\" moment, simmering tensions over Taiwan show how the US government is now building a new national security machine to challenge China's rising power.\n\nA significant moment\n\nThere is deep symbolism in the killing of Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon turned radical Islamic ideologue who was wanted by the US for years even before the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nZawahiri was indicted by the FBI for his alleged role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which heralded a new age of al Qaeda terrorism directed against Americans. He had a key role in the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. Successive presidents vowed to bring the leaders of bin Laden's terrorist network to justice, and Biden is the latest to have done so, in one of the few common threads in recent US foreign policy spanning administrations.\n\n\"Now justice has been done. This terrorist leader is no more,\" the President said, addressing the nation from his Covid-19 isolation on a balcony overlooking the South lawn of the White House on Monday evening.\n\nIf Zawahiri lacked the charisma and mobilizing power of bin Laden, killed in a daring US Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan in 2011, his influence and organization of al Qaeda resulted in huge damage to the US. His demise validates American vows to pursue its enemies to the end of the earth.\n\n\"In many ways, it bookends the operation to go after bin Laden,\" former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.\n\nHe added that the loss of Zawahiri means al Qaeda no longer has the leadership structure to pose a threat to the United States or its allies.\n\nA bonus for a wobbling presidency\n\nMore immediately, the death of Zawahiri represents a significant moment for Biden and his wobbling presidency.\n\nIt may go some way to purge painful memories of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan a year ago. It may help the administration recast what are likely to be damning anniversary reviews of that foreign policy failure later this month. And more importantly, the strike backs up Biden's claim to be able to target US enemies in Afghanistan from \"over the horizon\" -- part of his argument that America no longer needs to maintain large land armies on foreign battlefields.\n\nWhile Zawahiri was unable to reconstitute al Qaeda after the death of bin Laden to its former power, the circumstances of his death stand as a warning to other terrorist groups in Afghanistan and elsewhere. However, the fact that Zawahiri was apparently killed in an attack on a house in the center of Kabul raises real concerns that Afghanistan -- back under Taliban control -- is yet again harboring al Qaeda.\n\nBut it also shows that the US has intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan despite the exit of US diplomats, military and intelligence officials from the country last year. Biden chose the more optimistic takeaway, arguing that the operation proved his promise that he would not allow Afghanistan to again become a safe haven for terrorists.\n\nPresidents typically don't take life-and-death decisions about national security to massage their own approval ratings -- at least most of them don't. But they all operate in a political context because of their position. There is no doubt that Biden could benefit incrementally from his commander-in-chief moment on television, reporting from the White House to Americans about the killing of an enemy.\n\nThe drone strike in Kabul came as Biden was being assailed by Republicans as weak and incapable. During the US departure from Afghanistan, Biden's reputation as a safe pair of hands on foreign policy took a hit as Americans watched scenes of desperate refugees falling to their deaths from departing US planes, and the US military admitted to a botched drone strike that killed 10 Afghan civilians -- including seven children.\n\nBut it's also unlikely that Monday's news will do much to alter the fate of Democrats in November's midterm elections, who fear heavy losses amid new signs the economy could plunge into recession and following months of punishing high inflation. Foreign policy victories can be fleeting, and decapitating terror groups no longer brings the political payoff that it did when then-President George W. Bush was keeping score in the years after 9/11.\n\nIt may take a few days to fully assess how Zawahiri was located and to confirm the White House versions of events. On occasion, administrations have gotten details wrong or out of context in early readouts. Biden's assurance that no civilians were killed in the drone strike could not immediately be confirmed.\n\nIn an increasingly polarized nation, the killing could offer a rare moment of unity -- even if the distance from the 9/11 attacks and the relatively low profile of Zawahiri didn't send crowds to chant outside the White House as was the case when bin Laden was killed.\n\nStill, any satisfaction over the killing of Zawahiri is likely to be soon overtaken by a more multilayered and urgent US conundrum abroad -- the possibility of a standoff over Taiwan that threatens to erupt even as the US wages an effective proxy war against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUS and Taiwanese officials have said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to defy increasingly irate warnings in Beijing and fly into Taipei. Some foreign policy experts fear the trip could provoke an unprecedented Chinese response.\n\nPresidents know only too well that when one national security threat is extinguished, the next is just over the horizon.", "authors": ["Analysis Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/02/ayman-al-zawahri-killing-nyc-memorial/10216071002/", "title": "Ayman al-Zawahri killing sparks reflection at NYC's 9/11 memorial", "text": "NEW YORK CITY – One day after President Joe Biden announced that a U.S. strike killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri, Joe Gallant gazed at the 9/11 memorial built where the World Trade Center once stood.\n\n\"We had planned to come here today anyway to honor the thousands who were killed,\" said Gallant, 68, who was visiting with his two nephews from Bangor, Maine. \"So the timing couldn't have been better that we're here on the day they nailed one of the SOBs that did it.\"\n\nA U.S. drone strike over the weekend in Afghanistan killed al-Zawahri, 71, nearly 21 years after he helped Osama bin Laden orchestrate the attacks on New York and Washington that killed roughly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001.

The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm,\" Biden said from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Zawahiri and the US' strike against him.\n\nHow did Zawahiri rise to power?\n\nBorn in 1951, Zawahiri grew up in an upper-class neighborhood in Cairo, Egypt, the son of a prominent physician and grandson of renowned scholars.\n\nHis grandfather, Rabia'a al-Zawahiri, was an imam at al-Azhar University in Cairo. His great-uncle, Abdel Rahman Azzam, was the first secretary of the Arab League.\n\nZawahiri was imprisoned for his involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.\n\n\"We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? Who are we?\" he said in a jailhouse interview.\n\nBy that time, Zawahiri, a young doctor, was already a committed terrorist who conspired to overthrow the Egyptian government for years and sought to replace it with fundamentalist Islamic rule. He proudly endorsed Sadat's assassination after the Egyptian leader made peace with Israel.\n\nWhat was his relationship with Osama bin Laden?\n\nZawahiri left Egypt in 1985 and made his way to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he worked as a surgeon treating the fighters who were engaged with Soviet troops in Afghanistan.\n\nThat is where Zawahiri met bin Laden, a prominent Mujahedeen leader and who also had left behind a privileged upbringing to join the fight in Afghanistan. The two became close, linked by their common bond as \"Afghan Arabs.\"\n\nAfter reuniting in Afghanistan, bin Laden and Zawahiri appeared together in early 1998 announcing the formation of the World Islamic Front for the Jihad Against the Jews and the Crusaders -- formally merging the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda.\n\nAt one point, he acted as bin Laden's personal physician.\n\n\"We are working with brother bin Laden,\" he said in announcing the merger of his terror group in May 1998. \"We know him since more than 10 years now. We fought with him here in Afghanistan.\"\n\nOsama bin Laden sits with Ayman al-Zawahiri on November 10, 2001.\n\nTogether, the two terror leaders signed a fatwa, or declaration: \"The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim.\"\n\nWhat role did Zawahiri play in al Qaeda's attacks against the US?\n\nThe attacks against the US and its facilities began shortly after bin Laden and Zawahiri's fatwa, with the suicide bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 5,000 others.\n\nThen, there was the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, when suicide bombers on a dinghy detonated their boat, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39 others.\n\nThe culmination of Zawahiri's terror plotting came on September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, headed for Washington, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back.\n\nBefore and after the September 11 attacks, Zawahiri appeared on numerous video and audiotapes calling for attacks against Western targets and urging Muslims to support his cause.\n\nSome Egyptians traced Zawahiri's anger toward the United States to what many Afghan Arabs felt was the CIA's betrayal to support their cause after the Soviets left Afghanistan and the country slipped into tribal anarchy.\n\nOthers date Zawahiri's wrath to 1998, when US officials pushed for the extradition of a number of Egyptian Islamic Jihad members from Albania to stand trial in Egypt for terrorism.\n\nZawahiri's brother, Mohammad, told CNN in 2012 , \"Before you call me and my brother terrorists, let's define its meaning. If it means those who are bloodthirsty merciless killers, then this is not what we are about,\" he said.\n\n\"We only try to regain some of our rights that have been hijacked by Western powers throughout history.\"\n\nWhen did Zawahiri start leading al Qaeda?\n\nZawahiri became al Qaeda's leader after US forces killed bin Laden in 2011.\n\nHe was constantly on the move once the US-led invasion of Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks. At one point, he narrowly escaped a US onslaught in the rugged, mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, an attack that left his wife and children dead.\n\nZawahiri \"was not a charismatic leader in the mold of bin Laden,\" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said Monday . \"He didn't prove to be a very competent leader of al-Qaeda. But the reason I think that he was killed in Afghanistan over the weekend was he was beginning to take a lot more risks.\"\n\n\"According to the United Nations, he'd released kind of an unprecedented number of videos. Every time you record a video, there's the chain of custody of that video, getting it out there, somebody maybe taking the video,\" Bergen continued.\n\n\"So he was becoming more prominent. And, I think, it seems to me that may well have been the reason that he was detected.\"\n\nIn a briefing by a United Nations panel of experts last week it was noted that Zawahiri's apparent increased comfort and ability to communicate has coincided with the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan and the consolidation of power of key al-Qaeda allies within their de-facto administration.\n\nThe last known public address by Zawahiri was an audio message released on July 13 by the media arm of al Qaeda.\n\nHow did the US kill Zawahiri?\n\nThe US undertook \"a precision counterterrorism operation\" in Afghanistan targeting Zawahiri, who was sheltering in a safehouse in Kabul, a senior administration told reporters Monday.\n\nAccording to the official, \"a precise tailored airstrike\" using two hellfire missiles was conducted at 9:48 p.m. ET on Saturday, July 30 -- 6:18 a.m. Kabul time -- via unmanned air strike and was authorized by Biden following weeks of meetings with his Cabinet and key advisers.\n\nNo American personnel were on the ground in Kabul at the time of the strike.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/08/30/afghanistan-live-updates/5645806001/", "title": "Afghanistan latest: Taliban leaders walk across airport runway to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — The last plane carrying U.S. forces left Afghanistan on Monday, meeting an Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw U.S. forces from the Taliban-led nation, after 20 years of war that left nearly 2,500 American troops dead and spanned four presidencies.\n\nThe Biden administration has spent weeks scrambling to evacuate Americans and Afghan translators who helped the American military after the Taliban quickly gained control of Kabul on Aug. 15.\n\nThe withdrawal also comes in the aftermath of an ISIS-K suicide bombing that killed dozens of people, including 13 U.S. service members, on Aug. 26.

The past 17 days have seen our troops execute the largest airlift in US history, evacuating over 120,000 US citizens, citizens of our allies, and Afghan allies of the United States. They have done it with unmatched courage, professionalism, and resolve. Now, our 20-year military presence in Afghanistan has ended.\n\n\"Tomorrow afternoon, I will address the American people on my decision not to extend our presence in Afghanistan beyond 8/31. For now, I will report that it was the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs and of all of our commanders on the ground to end our airlift mission as planned. Their view was that ending our military mission was the best way to protect the lives of our troops, and secure the prospects of civilian departures for those who want to leave Afghanistan in the weeks and months ahead.\n\n\"I have asked the Secretary of State to lead the continued coordination with our international partners to ensure safe passage for any Americans, Afghan partners, and foreign nationals who want to leave Afghanistan. This will include work to build on the UN Security Council Resolution passed this afternoon that sent the clear message of what the international community expects the Taliban to deliver on moving forward, notably freedom of travel. The Taliban has made commitments on safe passage and the world will hold them to their commitments. It will include ongoing diplomacy in Afghanistan and coordination with partners in the region to reopen the airport allowing for continued departure for those who want to leave and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.\n\n\"For now, I urge all Americans to join me in grateful prayer tonight for three things. First, for our troops and diplomats who carried out this mission of mercy in Kabul and at tremendous risk with such unparalleled results: an airlift that evacuated tens of thousands more people than any imagined possible. Second, to the network of volunteers and veterans who helped identify those needing evacuation, guide them to the airport, and provide support along the way.

Zawahiri, the world's most wanted terrorist and one of the masterminds of the 9/11 terror attacks, was killed after months of highly secret planning by Biden and a tight circle of his senior advisers. Throughout the complex effort to plan the strike, Biden repeatedly tasked his officials with ensuring that civilians -- including members of Zawahiri's family -- were not killed. None were, according to the White House. \"People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer,\" Biden said. The moment was a political win for the President , as he emphasized the US \"will always do what is necessary\" to ensure the security of Americans.\n\n2. Taiwan\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia, according to a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official, despite warnings from Biden administration officials who are worried about China's response to such a high-profile visit.

US Defense Department officials are now working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe. While the expected stop in Taiwan is not currently on Pelosi's itinerary, China has warned against the \"egregious political impact\" of the planned visit to the self-governing island that China claims as a part of its territory. Chinese officials have also reiterated that its military \"won't sit by idly\" if Beijing feels its \"sovereignty and territorial integrity\" is being threatened.\n\nJUST WATCHED Here's why Beijing sees Pelosi as a hostile figure Replay More Videos ...

We believe that some of these people are nearly or already out of the country.”\n\nThe U.S. says it has evacuated approximately 5,400 Americans since Aug. 14, including about 300 Americans over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe State Department said there are “roughly 280 additional individuals who self-identify as Americans in Afghanistan but who have not informed us of their plans to leave the country, or who have told us they do not intend to leave at all.”\n\nThe Biden administration is scrambling to evacuate U.S. citizens amid ongoing security threats around the Kabul airport. Pentagon officials say evacuation efforts are ongoing even as the military remains on track to withdrawal all American forces by Aug. 31.\n\n--Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nPentagon: US did not share info on drone strike with Taliban\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said the U.S. did not share any information about the airstrike on the ISIS targets with the Taliban.\n\nThe Biden administration has come under fire for coordinating security at the airport with the militant Islamic group.\n\nISIS-K considers the Taliban, noted for its brutality, to be insufficiently devout in its adherence to Islam. The two militant groups have engaged in attacks on each other.\n\n--Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nPentagon: Threat in Kabul remains 'active'\n\nKirby said the threat to U.S. military personnel at the airport in Kabul remains “active” and the military would conclude its withdrawal on Aug. 31 as scheduled.\n\n“The threats are still very real, they’re very dynamic and we are monitoring them in real time,” Kirby said of possible additional attacks from the Islamic State group.\n\n“Our mission to continue evacuating those as required and to meet the mission requirement by Aug. 31 is what commanders are executing,” Kirby said. “We will maintain the ability to defend ourselves and our operations all the way through.”\n\n--Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTwo ISIS-K members killed in U.S. drone strike\n\nWASHINGTON – Two high-profile members of the terrorist group ISIS-K were killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday and a third was wounded, the Pentagon said Saturday.\n\nThe Pentagon announced the drone strike Friday night and initially said one ISIS-K official was killed. Military officials updated the death toll Saturday morning.\n\nThe names of those killed were not released.\n\n“We know of zero civilian casualties,” said Army Maj. Gen. William D. “Hank” Taylor, joint staff deputy director for regional operations.\n\nPentagon press secretary John F.

Gen. William D. \"Hank\" Taylor said the U.S. would continue to conduct counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan, though he did not offer specifics.\n\n“Without specifying any future plans, I will say that we will continue to have the ability to defend ourselves,” he said. Taylor said the Pentagon would leverage its “over-the-horizon capability” to conduct strikes as needed. That refers to operations launched from bases outside of Afghanistan.\n\n\"We’re going to defend ourselves,\" Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby added later.\n\n--Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nEconomic crisis in Afghanistan\n\nAfghans are facing economic crises as many Western governments withhold support from Taliban rule.\n\nThe Taliban cannot access almost any of the central bank’s $9 billion in reserves, most of which is held by the New York Federal Reserve. The International Monetary Fund has also suspended the transfer of some $450 million. Without a regular supply of U.S. dollars, the local currency is at risk of collapse, which could send the price of basic goods soaring.\n\nIn Kabul, hundreds of protesters, including many civil servants, gathered outside a bank while countless more lined up at cash machines. The protesters said they had not been paid for the past three to six months and were unable to withdraw cash. ATM machines are still operating, but withdrawals are limited to around $200 every 24 hours.\n\nLater Saturday, the central bank ordered commercial bank branches to open and dispense up to $200 a day to customers, calling it a temporary measure.\n\nAfghanistan is heavily dependent on international aid, which covered around 75% of the toppled Western-backed government’s budget.\n\n--The Associated Press\n\nItaly's final evacuation flight lands in Rome\n\nItaly said its final evacuation flight had landed in Rome but that it would work with the United Nations and countries bordering Afghanistan to continue helping Afghans who had worked with its military contingent to leave the country.\n\n“Our imperative must be to not abandon the Afghan people,” especially women and children, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said Saturday. He said 4,890 Afghans were evacuated by Italy’s air force on 87 flights, but did not say how many others were still eligible.\n\n--The Associated Press\n\nBiden to huddle with national security advisers\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with his national security team at the White House on Saturday, just hours after a U.S. drone strike killed a key member of the terrorist group behind a deadly airport bombing in Kabul.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris will huddle with national security officials at 11 a.m. to hear intelligence, security and diplomatic updates on the evolving situation in Afghanistan, the White House said.\n\nThe Pentagon announced late Friday that a military drone strike targeted a planner for ISIS-K, the first American attack on the terrorist group following a bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport. Thirteen U.S. service members and at least 169 Afghan people died in Thursday's bombing.\n\nThe terrorist group ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe ISIS-K official killed in Friday’s drone strike was believed to be planning future attacks, the Pentagon said.

According to sources familiar with the matter, prosecutors are preparing for a court battle to force former White House officials to testify about former President Donald Trump's conversations and actions around the insurrection. This appears to be the clearest sign yet that federal investigators are homing in on Trump's conduct as he tried to prevent the transfer of power to Joe Biden. This court fight would put the Justice Department's investigation into a more aggressive stance than even the Mueller investigation -- a major yearslong criminal probe into Trump while he was President. He was not ultimately charged. This comes as the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot confirmed it intends to share 20 transcripts with the DOJ as the department ramps up its investigation.\n\n2. Kentucky\n\nAt least eight people are dead and hundreds of homes have been damaged following catastrophic flooding in eastern Kentucky on Thursday. Rescuers are working around the clock to reach difficult-to-access areas amid continuing storms, officials said. Floodwaters have washed out bridges, wiped out power lines and sent some residents scrambling to their rooftops as water gushed into their homes. Some families' houses and cars were submerged or swept away completely by the flooding , which has been exacerbated by overflowing creeks. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called it one of the most \"devastating flooding events in Kentucky's history,\" adding destruction is far from over as more rainfall is expected today.

And yet millions of American families will feel the economic consequences .\n\nThat's because the world economy and financial markets are interconnected. As Covid demonstrated, events on one side of the planet can set off shockwaves on the other side.\n\nIn this case, an invasion of Ukraine by Russia will likely drive up the already-high cost of living in the United States, rattle investment portfolios and perhaps even slow down the economic recovery.\n\n\"The average American household is going to bear the burden of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine,\" said RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas.\n\nMore pain at the pump\n\nOil prices have jumped to levels unseen since 2014, in part because this conflict could derail Russian energy supply.\n\nRussia is an energy superpower, producing 9.7 million barrels per day last year, according to Rystad Energy. That is second only to the United States and amounts to more oil than Iraq and Canada produced — combined.\n\nSupply is already failing to keep up with demand and investors are on high alert for any further supply shortfalls that could occur through in a variety of ways, including damaged infrastructure in a war, sanctions on Russia or Moscow moving to weaponize exports\n\nJPMorgan warned that oil prices could \"easily\" jump to $120 a barrel due to the crisis. In the unlikely event that Russian oil exports are halved, crude would surge to $150 a barrel, JPMorgan said.\n\nA dramatic spike in oil prices could be offset at least in part by consuming nations releasing emergency stockpiles and OPEC ramping up production.\n\nStill, another pop in oil prices would lift prices at the pump, which lag behind moves in crude prices. The national average price for a gallon of gas already stands at a seven-year high of $3.54 a gallon, according to AAA.\n\nHistoric inflation\n\nInflation is the biggest problem facing the US economy . And Russia's invasion could make it even worse.\n\nOil currently stands at about $100 a barrel, but if it hits $110, the year-over-year inflation rate would climb above 10% , according to an analysis by RSM shared with CNN. That's up from the current 7.5%.\n\nAmerican inflation hasn't climbed to 10% since 1981.\n\nNot only would prices at the pump rise, but higher oil and natural gas prices would drive up home heating and electricity costs.\n\nHigher energy prices would make it more expensive to fly and keep transportation and input costs elevated for businesses already grappling with surging expenses. Businesses would most likely pass along at least some of these higher costs to consumers in the form of price spikes.\n\nBeyond energy, other commodities could experience price volatility. Russia is a major producer of metals, including aluminum and palladium. Russia is also the biggest exporter of wheat, while Ukraine is a significant exporter of both wheat and corn.\n\n\"All of this would occur at a time when commodity supplies are more stressed than they have been in a generation,\" David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a report last week.\n\nOf course, inflationary pressures would likely be even greater for Europeans.\n\nMarket turbulence\n\nInvestors famously detest uncertainty. The Dow tumbled 700 points the morning after the invasion as investors confront the possibility of an oil shock, higher inflation and a confusing sanctions regime.\n\nA prolonged market downturn would wipe out wealth built up by families in the stock market and in retirement accounts. Market instability could also dent confidence among consumers and businesses alike.\n\nStocks do have a history of rebounding from geopolitical scares, although there is a relatively small sample size. And it's impossible to say how markets would respond in the current environment.\n\nSlower economic growth\n\nThe RSM analysis also found that a jump to $110 oil would dent US GDP by one percentage point.\n\nThat is not as dramatic as the impact to inflation, but it's still significant given that the US economy has not fully recovered all the jobs lost during Covid.\n\nHigher borrowing costs\n\nIf inflation spikes above 10%, the Federal Reserve would come under pressure to step up its fight to get prices under control.\n\nThat could mean a faster pace of interest rate hikes to cool off inflation.\n\nThe coming interest rate increases from the Fed will increase borrowing costs for consumers on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards. Mortgage rates have already spiked to pre-Covid levels in recent weeks, presenting a new challenge to wannabe home buyers.\n\nThe Fed could choose to shrug off intensifying inflation as just a temporary phenomenon driven by the Russia-Ukraine situation. However, that strategy did not work out well last year, with the Fed eventually abandoning its \"transitory\" description of Covid-related inflation.\n\nCyberattacks and more\n\nAs the Ukraine conflict escalates the US is also braced for Russian cyberattacks.\n\nThe hacking of the Colonial Pipeline last year showed just how disruptive a cyberattack can be in the real world. The cyber-intrusion shut down one of the most important pipelines in America, sparking panic buying that left many gas stations in the Southeast empty.\n\nA successful cyberattack on America's financial system — a top worry of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell — could be even more disruptive.\n\nA cyberattack is just one example of how the Russia-Ukraine situation could spill over into daily life.\n\n\"Wars evolve in unpredictable ways,\" JPMorgan's Kelly said. \"No one should assume that they can see all the impacts of a war at its outset.\"", "authors": ["Matt Egan", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/tompor/tompor/2015/06/07/student-loans-repay-delinquency-federal-reserve/28562447/", "title": "College student's nightmare: Loan debt and no degree", "text": "Susan Tompor\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen thinking about college debt, the big worry tends to be: Will a paycheck follow the college diploma? And will that job cover everyday bills, as well as monthly student loan payments?\n\nBut as the high school graduation celebrations wind down and the borrowing for college heats up, the real question to ask should be: Will I end up with a big bunch of debt and no degree?\n\nA new report on the economic well-being of U.S. households gives an interesting glimpse on student loans and the challenges facing families.\n\nThe Federal Reserve survey noted that 23% of adults currently have some education debt. In that group, about 15% had such debt for their own education; 6% had education debt for a spouse or partner; and 6% had college debt for their child's or grandchild's education.\n\nMore tidbits:\n\n■ Students who took on debt but didn't complete any degree are more likely to end up behind on student loan payments.\n\nAbout 16% of borrowers who did not complete any degree or certificate report being behind on payments, according to a survey released in May by the Federal Reserve Board. It jumps to 21% of those who have no degree and are no longer enrolled in the program for which they borrowed.\n\nBy contrast, 6% of borrowers who completed an associate degree report being behind on their student loan payments. The percentage drops to 4% for this who completed a bachelor's degree, according to the Fed report on household financial well-being.\n\n■ First-generation college students and those who attended for-profit colleges find things particularly tough.\n\nThe survey showed that 16% of borrowers who attended for-profit institutions said they were behind on student loan payments, compared with 6% of students who attended a public institution.\n\nThe study noted that students attending for-profit institutions are disproportionately likely to be first-generation college students or minority students and are less likely to complete a degree.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sued some for-profit chains in the past for predatory lending practices.\n\n■ The most frequent reason given for dropping out tends to be family obligations.\n\nNearly 38% of the respondents who dropped out said they did so because of family troubles. Family was a driving force especially among women. About 43% of women who started college but left gave family duties as the reason.\n\nBut students had other reasons for starting college but not getting a degree.\n\nAbout 27% said they did not complete a degree because they wanted to work.\n\nAbout 24% said college was too expensive so they did not complete a degree.\n\nOne in four, or 25%, said they were simply not interested in college or continuing college and did not complete a degree.\n\nNot surprisingly, the study concludes: \"One factor that is clearly associated with delinquency is failure to complete the degree for which the debt was incurred.\"\n\nMark Kantrowitz, a college debt expert and senior vice president and publisher for Edvisors.com, said students who drop out of college are four times more likely to default than students who graduate, and they represent 63% of defaults.\n\nDefault is defined as 360 days of non-payment on federal education loans.\n\nPerhaps, a contributing factor is that some students who drop out do not go through exit counseling, which reviews repayment options, or take advantage of those options.\n\nExit counseling is required when students graduate, leave school or drop below half-time enrollment. But sometimes that's done online.\n\nSome freshmen who drop out could have $5,500 in student loans. Some sophomores who drop out could have more than $11,000 in student loans, based on some estimates.\n\nChris Dlugozima, community educator for the GreenPath Debt Solutions office in White Plains, N.Y., said it's important that students realize that being 30 days late or more on student loan payments can drive down credit scores.\n\nIf someone has a private student loan, he or she should talk to the loan servicer and see what repayment options exist. In general, private loans have few repayment options and can lead to more repayment problems.\n\n\"With private loans, it's completely case by case but many lenders will offer forbearance options,\" Dlugozima said.\n\n\"It's always worth a phone call.\"\n\nAs part of a forbearance, a lender could allow you to delay or reduce payments but interest would continue to build. Typically, you'd continue paying the interest charges during a forbearance.\n\nYou'd need to submit an application to request a forbearance.\n\nVictoria Scavone, assistant vice president, Enrollment & Student Services at Walsh College in Troy, said borrowers can look into income-driven repayment plans on their federal loans if they're underemployed after graduation or end up leaving school without a degree.\n\nKeith Williams, associate director of financial aid at Michigan State University, said students don't realize their repayment options if they do not take advantage of exit counseling when they drop out of school.\n\nEven if a student has to leave because of family obligations, Williams said, they may qualify for some breaks due to an economic hardship.\n\nEconomic hardship deferment is available for up to 36 months.\n\n\"The key is to stay in contact with your servicer,\" Williams said.\n\nStudents who drop out should contact a college's financial aid office.\n\nStudents don't have to make payments based on a standard repayment plan for federal student loans where the monthly payments are higher. Instead, they can study some other options at www.studentloans.gov.\n\nContact Susan Tompor: 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/05/03/fed-rate-hike-interest-debt-mortgages/9621177002/", "title": "How Fed's bigger, faster rate hikes will affect your credit card ...", "text": "The Fed raised its key short-term rate from near zero by a quarter percentage point in March.\n\nOn Wednesday, the central bank is set to push it up another half point, its largest bump in 22 years.\n\nThe move will drive rates higher on everything from credit cards to mortgages.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Americans were facing sharply higher borrowing costs as the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to curb soaring inflation.\n\nNow the Fed is putting those rate increases on steroids, and consumers will have to dig even deeper into their wallets to pay off loans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/economy/inflation-recession-economy-deutsche-bank/index.html", "title": "A major recession is coming, Deutsche Bank warns - CNN", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Deutsche Bank raised eyebrows earlier this month by becoming the first major bank to forecast a US recession, albeit a \"mild\" one.\n\nNow, it's warning of a deeper downturn caused by the Federal Reserve's quest to knock down stubbornly high inflation.\n\n\"We will get a major recession,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report to clients on Tuesday.\n\nThe problem, according to the bank, is that while inflation may be peaking, it will take a \"long time\" before it gets back down to the Fed's goal of 2%.

And in April, the shelter index rose at its fastest year-over-year pace since April 1991.\n\nThe shelter index was up 5.1% on a yearly basis, according to new data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. As part of that index, rent increased 4.8% in April over the past 12 months.\n\nOverall, the CPI shot up 8.3% for the 12 months ending April. The new number is slightly lower than what we saw for March, breaking a seven-month streak of consistently higher CPI year-over-year numbers.\n\nThe U.S. inflation rate hit 8.5% in March over the past 12 months.\n\nMore:Federal Reserve interest rate hike may not be the last as inflation skyrockets\n\nMore:Fake Caller ID in utility shut-off scam cost Troy woman $700 via Zelle\n\nEven so, consumers saw higher prices for shelter, food, airline fares and new vehicles, which were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted monthly figures for April.\n\nWorries about continually rising costs for housing and shelter are building.\n\nThe CPI measures rents that people are currently paying and their leases can be slow to reflect market conditions. Rent for many is expected to move significantly higher in 2022.\n\nAs rents rise, many renters will face greater financial vulnerability in the months ahead when they are not able to keep their rental costs at or below 30% of their total income.\n\nOur grandparents used to have an old adage of budgeting one week's pay for rent but finding housing that is equal to 25% of your net income is increasingly harder to do, said Katie Bossler, quality assurance specialist for the nonprofit GreenPath Financial Wellness.\n\nA more common rule of thumb lately, she said, for a housing budget is to spend no more than 30% of your gross monthly income.\n\nRenters, she said, should be sure that the 30% of gross monthly income includes rent, heat, water and electricity. For homeowners, that 30% ratio should include the mortgage payment and interest, insurance, property taxes and utilities.\n\nThe 30% standard limit traces back to 1981 when the federal government defined a household as \"cost-burdened\" if one spent more than 30% of income on housing, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nHousing costs include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, insurance and property taxes.\n\nInflation pressures build\n\nA spike in housing costs and rent is increasingly adding to painfully high inflation, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.\n\nUntil rent growth moderates, Zandi said, inflation will remain uncomfortably high.\n\nThe rent index rose 0.6% in April, based on seasonally adjusted changes from the previous month, according to the latest inflation figures. That is up from a 0.4% increase for the seasonally adjusted March data.\n\n\"Given the severe shortage of housing and quickly rising rents, it is adding significantly to inflation,\" Zandi said.\n\n\"New housing construction is picking up, and will pick up much more as supply chains iron out and builders can get the materials they need to complete homes,\" Zandi said.\n\nBut he noted that it will take several years before there will be enough housing supply to get rent increases within a more moderate 3% to 5% range.\n\nRent expected to keep going up\n\nResearch suggests that the rate of rent inflation in the CPI will double in 2022, according to comments made this spring by Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors..\n\nWaller noted rents recently have \"accelerated sharply.\"\n\n\"As housing costs continue to increase,\" Waller said, \"housing will likely become an ever-larger share of household budgets.\"\n\nThe CPI for housing shelter — or rent inflation — was 3.3% in 2021. Zandi agreed that it is very likely to be double that in 2022 given the acceleration since late last year.\n\nYounger consumers and those who are Black or Hispanic are more likely to feel the greatest burden because they are often renters, according to an August 2021 Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nNationwide, about 58% of households headed by Black adults rent their homes; the figure is nearly 52% of Hispanic- or Latino-led households, according to Pew Research Center’s analysis of census data.\n\nRoughly 35% of all U.S. households were headed by renters.\n\nFinancial stress builds for those already struggling\n\nThe rent increase locally is much smaller than in many markets but adds to one's financial stress nonetheless.\n\nOver the past two years, rents have gone up 8.8% based on median rental prices in metro Detroit, according to March data from Realtor.com. The median rent — meaning half of renters are paying more and half are paying less — was $1,360 in Detroit.\n\nDetroit was ranked No. 10 for the smallest growth in rental markets based on two-year growth from March 2020 through March 2022, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThe largest average two-year rent change was 58% in Miami with a median rent of $2,988 in March. Other huge hikes took place in Florida in Tampa (up 45.8%), Orlando (up 34.7%) and Jacksonville (up 29.2%).\n\nIn addition, some areas saw gains of nearly 30% or more — including Memphis, Tennessee.; Las Vegas; New Orleans; Richmond, Virginia, and Phoenix — in the past two years.\n\nExperts blame:\n\nRising rental demands as some would-be buyers are priced out of the housing market\n\nA large group of Generation Z consumers who are 25 years old and younger and entering the rental market and a shortage of apartments and rental homes\n\nLow vacancy rates in many areas.\n\n\"While the jobs market is strong, it's unlikely that we'll see enough income growth to keep rents under 30% of monthly paychecks — especially with higher inflation and everyday costs,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com, in a statement.\n\nAffordability is going down because paychecks aren't rising fast enough to compensate for astronomical rent hikes.\n\nIf you're dealing with other major expenses — such as child care, student loans, credit card debt or a chunky car payment — you'd need to dedicate even less than 30% of your budget to housing costs.\n\nMuch can depend on how much money you're making and whether your work is steady or seasonal. Or what other big expenses your family faces, too.\n\nIn 2020, 46% of American renters spent 30% or more of their income on housing, according to a review of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Research Center. That includes 23% who spent at least 50% of their income this way.\n\nMetro Detroit renters spend about 25.4% of income overall on rent, according to data based on February rents and analyzed by Realtor.com.\n\nAcross the country, about 29.7% of the typical household income went toward rent in the 50 largest U.S. metro markets, up from the 25.3% for the same month in 2021.\n\nIn some big cities — including Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego and New York City — renters paid a staggering 40% or more of their incomes toward housing.\n\nThe hikes in monthly rent payments have been particularly hard on lower income families and seniors in Detroit who have limited budgets, according to Kellie Maki Foster, the Detroit eviction prevention director for Lakeshore Legal Aid, a nonprofit law firm that provides advice and representation for low income consumers.\n\nAs rents go up in trendy areas, such as Corktown, many people are priced out of the apartments or homes where they had been living. Because rents are going up across the board, though, many who are priced out of one area find it tougher to locate a more affordable place to live somewhere else.\n\n\"People are really having a hard time finding housing,\" Maki Foster said.\n\nSome monthly rental costs are so high that some lower income renters are seeing 40% to 50% of their income go to cover housing in Detroit, Maki Foster said.\n\n\"People are having a really hard time finding housing,\" she said.\n\nIn Michigan, she said, a landlord can raise the rent quickly if you're on a month-to-month lease. Or the landlord can give you a 30-day notice if your yearly lease is about to expire.\n\nSome estimates of how bad things have gotten\n\nWe're seeing all sorts of reports that indicate different numbers for just how much rents went up recently. The information is based on a variety of surveys from different rental apps and outfits.\n\nRent.com released a report in late April that indicated that the year-over-year change for rent in Michigan was up 13.94% — with the average rent being $1,206 a month, up $147 a month from a year ago.\n\nZumper says that year over year, Detroit had the fastest growing rent out of the five largest cities in Michigan, up 14.7% since this time last year. Rent in Ypsilanti climbed 13.1% in the past year and Ann Arbor was up 11.1%.\n\nAccording to Zumper, the median one-bedroom rent in Michigan was $953 last month. By contrast, Ann Arbor's was $1,300 and Royal Oak's was $1,200. The median one-bedroom monthly rent in Detroit was $1,090 and $850 in Warren.\n\nHow can you hold the line?\n\nIt becomes increasingly important to pay close attention to your budget, as prices go up for all sorts of expenses.\n\nThe latest year-over-year inflation data indicated, for example, that food at home has gone up 9.4% in the past 12 months, gasoline went up 43.6% and new vehicles went up 13.2% and used car and truck prices soared 22.7%.\n\nSome people are able to tap into their savings now to cover higher costs but savings will dwindle at some point. So it is important to pull back on spending where you can.\n\nHere's a look at some tips for holding down costs for rent:\n\nConsider ways to compromise, such as opting to live in a different neighborhood or community, dealing with a longer commute or skipping features that you might be able to live without. Do you really need a swimming pool or fitness center?\n\nOne budget guideline: If possible, try to spend only 50% of your monthly income on all of your necessities, such as food, rent, debt and transportation. You'd aim to limit your spending on nonessentials, including vacations and going out to eat, to 30% or less. And then put 20% or so into savings, including a savings account and longer term retirement savings, such as a 401(k).\n\nReevaluate if you'd like to get a roommate as a way to cut down on costs.\n\nTry to stay on top of what's available. Tap into some rental apps, such as those on Realtor.com, Zillow Rentals, Trulia Rentals and Zumper. You may be notified when something in your price range hits the market.\n\nThe Michigan State Housing Development Authority links to an online resource called AffordableHousing.com.\n\nSee if you can wait until winter to move, according to Jeff Andrews, senior data analyst at Zumper, who notes that rent prices tend to cool a bit in the winter months.\n\nShop around before your lease expires to see what rental rates are around town and explore your options.

That money does not necessarily stay in Washington, however. The federal government generates revenue from sources like income and employment taxes and redistributes it based on need. And not all states benefit equally.\n\nThe total amount the federal government collected from each state in the 2017 fiscal year ranged from $5.6 billion from Vermont to $435.6 billion from California. The majority of states – including Vermont and California – ultimately get more money back than they contribute.\n\nMoney from the federal government is redistributed back to states in the form of grants, aid programs for the needy and payments to major government contracting firms such as defense companies.\n\nStock market:Here's how much the Dow was worth the year you were born\n\nDid yours make the list?:These are the 25 worst counties to live in.\n\nA recent report from public policy think tank the Rockefeller Institute of Government titled “Giving or Getting?

States were ranked based on the amount of money they received per capita from the federal government in fiscal 2017 minus the amount residents and organizations paid the federal government per capita.\n\nThe states receiving the most from Washington on a per capita basis tend have relatively large poor populations that depend on federal assistance programs like SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) and Medicaid.\n\nOn the flip side, the states that give more to the federal government than they receive tend to have higher income residents. Exceptions include states like Maryland and Virginia, which, though they are wealthier states, also benefit from disproportionately high federal funding partly due to their large defense contracting sectors.\n\n1.

The widening shadow of recession. Fed interest rate cuts and government stimulus.\n\nIt's beginning to feel a lot like 2008 again. And not in a good way.\n\nFor many Americans, the stomach-churning market drops and growing recession talk of the past few weeks – triggered by the global spread of the coronavirus – are reviving memories of the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nTake a breath. While the toll the infection ultimately takes on the nation isn’t clear, the economic upheaval caused by the outbreak will likely not be nearly as damaging or long-lasting as the historic downturn of 2007-09.\n\nSave better, spend better:All the money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here\n\n“A recession is not inevitable,” says Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group. “If we do get a recession, it is likely to be brief and much less severe than the Great Recession.”\n\nFor one thing, the 2008 financial crisis and recession resulted from years of deeply rooted weak spots in the economy. That’s not the case now.\n\n“What we’re seeing is caused by something external to the economy,” Faucher says.\n\n“It’s closer to a natural disaster,” says Kathy Bostjancic, director of U.S. Macro Investors Services at Oxford Economics.\n\nSilly tax mistakes:7 common filing errors to avoid this year\n\nStaying cool in a panic:Coronavirus shouldn't stop you from adding to your portfolio\n\nPartly as a result, the economy’s major players – consumers, businesses and lenders – are much better positioned to withstand the blows and bounce back.\n\nHere’s a look at how the current crisis compares with the meltdown more than a decade ago.\n\nThe cause\n\nThe Great Recession. The bruising downturn was set off by an overheated housing market. Banks and other lenders approved mortgages – including many to buyers who weren’t qualified, driving up home prices to stratospheric levels. The banks bundled the mortgages into securities and sold them to other financial institutions.\n\nWhen home prices began spiraling down, millions of Americans stopped making mortgage payments and lost their homes while the banks that held the securities were pushed to the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nWidespread layoffs in real estate, construction and banking hammered consumer spending and led to deeper job losses throughout the economy. Bank lending was virtually frozen, grinding the gears of the economy to a near halt. The problems had been simmering in the housing market and banking system for years.\n\nCurrent crisis. The coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sparked today’s economic hazard. There are now more than 100,000 cases worldwide, most of them in China, and the death toll has topped 4,000. In the U.S., more than 800 people have been infected and 28 have died.\n\nBecause far fewer people are affected than in 2007-2009, the economic toll has been limited so far. The travel and tourism industry has suffered the most, with businesses canceling conferences and trade shows and consumers scrapping vacation plans. Disruptions to deliveries of manufacturing parts and retail goods from China could temporarily shut down American factories and leave store shelves empty.\n\nAs Americans avoid more public places, the virus is likely to hurt sales at restaurants, malls and other venues. There are some signs retailers are already taking a hit. In the last week of February, foot traffic to Walmart stores fell 16.5% compared with the previous week, according to consumer data firm Cuebiq. In the same week, however, traffic to Costco stores rose 7.7%.\n\nHousehold debt\n\nGreat Recession. Since banks freely doled out credit for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, household debt climbed to a record 134% of gross domestic product, according to Oxford Economics and the Federal Reserve. Americans had been saving just 3.6% of their income at the end of 2007. As Americans worked down that debt, spending fell sharply.\n\nCurrent crisis. Household debt is at a historically low 96% of GDP. Households are saving about 8% of their income. All of that means they can handle a brief slump and continue spending at a reduced level.\n\n“Consumers are in good shape,” Faucher says.\n\nJob losses\n\nGreat Recession. Nearly 9 million Americans lost their jobs in the downturn. Unemployment more than doubled to 10%.\n\nCurrent crisis. Losses are likely to total in the thousands, with travel and tourism and manufacturing enduring much of them, Bostjancic says. The 3.5% unemployment rate, a 50-year low, could rise to 3.8% to 4.1%, says Diane Swonk, chief economist of Grant Thornton.\n\nHow long it lasts\n\nGreat Recession. With millions out of work and household and business spending decimated, the downturn lasted 18 months.\n\nCurrent crisis. Assuming the number of cases peak in the next few months and abates by summer, Swonk says any downturn is likely to last six months or so.\n\nThe economy\n\nGreat Recession. The economy contracted in five of six quarters during the slump, falling as much as 8.4% in late 2008.\n\nCurrent crisis. Most economists expect the virus to shave growth by one or two percentage points over the next couple of quarters.\n\nThe stock market\n\nGreat Recession: The stock market plummeted 57% during the crisis.\n\nCurrent crisis. The stock market hasn’t seen the same sizable drop that the broader market suffered in the depths of the financial crisis. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 14.9% from its Feb. 19 record through Tuesday, teetering on the brink of a bear market, or a drop of 20% from a peak.\n\nCorporate health\n\nGreat Recession. Corporations had $5.8 trillion in rated debt as of March 31, 2009, according to S&P Global Ratings. Less than two-thirds, or about 65%, was investment grade, which ratings agencies determined was highly likely to be repaid.\n\nA wide variety of companies, including financial institutions, automakers and retailers, collapsed as their revenues plunged.\n\nIn the automotive sector, for example, manufacturers cut about 278,400 jobs, or about 29% of their collective workforce from January 2008 to January 2010, automakers and suppliers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAutomotive companies are particularly vulnerable to economic downturns because people can often hold off on buying new vehicles until conditions improve. U.S. auto sales plunged during the Great Recession.\n\nCurrent crisis. Corporations had $9.3 trillion in rated debt in 2019, according to S&P Global Ratings.\n\nBut a higher percentage of corporate debt today is considered to be investment grade at 72%.\n\nThat said, conditions for repayment are clearly deteriorating. “The stress has been very, very quickly accelerating,” said Sudeep Kesh, head of credit markets research for S&P Global Ratings, adding that “there’s a flight to quality” as investors pile into U.S. Treasurys and highly-rated corporate bonds.\n\nThe major sector most likely to fail to make payments on time, as of 2019, was the automotive industry, where about 4 in 5 companies have debt rated as speculative.\n\nAnother sector facing significant risk is the retail industry, where department stores, mall-based retailers and many other shops have already been struggling.\n\nThough the oil-and-gas sector is expected to be hit hard by the sharp decline in oil prices, the industry is heading into this crisis in decent shape. Only 31% of oil-and-gas companies had debt rated as junk in 2019.\n\nBanking regulations\n\nGreat Recession. Flaws in oversight and weak regulations at Wall Street's largest investment banks were other contributing factors to the financial crisis. Some experts point to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which once kept commercial and investment banking separate.\n\nThe financial regulation, which had helped mitigate risks posed by big banks, was passed in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression and was later repealed in 1999. The move effectively allowed banks to become even larger, or \"too big to fail.\"\n\nRegulators including the Federal Reserve failed to crack down on questionable mortgage practices that didn't take into account a borrower's ability to repay a loan. The central bank had a looser set of rules for mortgage lenders and fewer protections for home buyers that some experts argue contributed to abusive lending.\n\nCurrent crisis. The global financial crisis ushered in sweeping changes to how the U.S. government regulates the banking industry. The new era, which included the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, required banks to have more cash in reserves to provide a cushion in case the financial system faced economic shocks.\n\nIn the U.S., banks with more than $100 billion in assets are required to take the Federal Reserve’s “stress tests,” a move that ensures financial firms have the capital necessary to continue operating during times of economic duress.\n\nThe magnitude of the challenges the economy faces aren’t as dire as the obstacles during the Great Recession, experts say.\n\n“It’s a difference in severity,” says Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. “Capital requirements have put banks in a much more comfortable position to be able withstand a major shock.”\n\nTo be sure, banks’ profitability could be threatened in the near term if they are forced to tighten lending standards. A historic drop in bond yields recently could pressure banks further because it tends to hurt their profitability.\n\nSome financial institutions, typically regional banks, could face some obstacles over the coming months if they are lending money to energy companies. Those stocks have been pummeled recently following a precipitous drop in crude prices. But larger banks likely won’t face major risks since they are typically more diversified and aren’t concentrated in one sector, Ma says.\n\n“This isn’t a financial crisis,” says Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at broker-dealer Meridian Equity Partners. “This is a global epidemic. This isn’t a flaw in the system that we’re uncovering like the subprime mortgage debacle.”\n\nThe Fed\n\nGreat Recession: The Federal Reserve’s key interest rate was at 5.25% in 2007 as worries about the housing meltdown grew. That gave the central bank plenty of room to slash the rate to near zero by late 2008. The Fed also launched unprecedented bond purchases to lower long-term rates, such as for mortgages.\n\nCurrent crisis: The Fed’s benchmark rate is at a range of just 1% to 1.25%, giving officials little room to cut. And 10-year Treasury rates are already below 1%, raising questions about the effectiveness of a renewed bond-buying campaign.\n\nThe stimulus\n\nGreat Recession: The downturn inflicted pain throughout the economy, and so Congress passed a sweeping stimulus. The $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act doled out tax savings and credits to individuals and companies; provided funding for healthcare centers and schools; assisted low-income workers; and approved massive upgrades to transportation, energy and communications networks.\n\nCurrent crisis: The damage this time is more contained and lawmakers are discussing more targeted measures, such as helping the beleaguered travel industry and offsetting income losses for hourly workers by expanding paid sick leave and unemployment insurance.\n\nHousing\n\nGreat Recession: During the housing bubble that began in the 1990s, home prices more than doubled by 2006 before crashing, according to the National Association of Realtors. The housing market remained in the doldrums through 2012.\n\nCurrent crisis: Although prices have risen steadily in recent years, they’re just 22% above their peak. Homes aren’t overpriced, Faucher says. That means with mortgage rates low, housing can help offset troubles in the rest of the economy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/16/cost-college-top-universities-pay-off-most-stanford-princeton/1742297001/", "title": "The top 50 US colleges that pay off the most 2019", "text": "Abigail Hess\n\nCNBC\n\nEach year, high school students across the U.S. march through campuses on guided tours, pore over course catalogs, and frantically check mailboxes and inboxes for letters granting them admission to the next phase of life: college.\n\nMost are facing significant financial questions. Research consistently demonstrates that college graduates earn more than their peers without degrees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans with a bachelor’s degree have median weekly earnings of $1,173, compared with just $712 a week for those who have a high school diploma. Still, experts urge high school students to think carefully before taking on significant amounts of debt to finance a college degree.\n\nDon't overpack:7 things college freshmen don't need – and 10 they do\n\nUgly is in:Crocs have taken over teen footwear\n\nCollege costs can be difficult to estimate, and even for college applicants with the foresight to research things like debt balances at graduation and average alumni salaries, outcomes can be challenging to quantify. Sticker prices published by universities do not include grants, scholarships or loans. Financial aid awards can change from year to year. Housing, travel, books and other personal expenses can add up quickly.\n\nAnd less than half, 41%, of first-time, full-time college students earn their bachelor’s degree in four years. Many of them end up paying for more than four years of college, driving up the cost of attendance significantly.\n\nCNBC Make It set out to capture the information students would need to balance these considerations. The result is our first list of the U.S. colleges that pay off the most, a ranking that spotlights 50 schools that provide students the highest average salaries for their tuition dollars.\n\nWe started by identifying the true net cost of each college for the typical American student — including tuition, fees, books, supplies and other expenses — after subtracting scholarships and grants. Using data from Tuition Tracker, a tool created by education-focused nonprofit news organization The Hechinger Report, we looked at the net cost for students from families making between $48,001 and $75,000, an income range established by the Department of Education. We chose to focus on this bracket because it includes the median U.S. household income, $61,372.\n\nWells Fargo:Earnings top estimates on strong consumer checking\n\nTesla:Employees say they took shortcuts to meet aggressive production goals\n\nThe Hechinger Report calculates net cost by subtracting federal, state, local and institutional grants and scholarships from the sticker price for first-time, full-time (and, at public universities, in-state) undergraduates based on data provided by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThen, using data from PayScale’s College Salary Report, we divided net cost by graduates’ expected annual earnings, which was calculated based on the median salary of graduates with less than five years of experience as well as those with 10 or more years of experience. The ranking gives greater weight to workers’ earnings in the years immediately after college, when individuals are the most impacted by college costs and student debt. (You can read our full methodology here.)\n\nWe excluded tuition-free institutions from the list, including military schools like West Point and U.S. Naval Academy, because the cost of post-college military service introduces an additional factor that’s challenging to measure against other schools.\n\nStanford University takes first place on the list. According to The Hechinger Report, the net cost for a student from a family that earns between $48,001 and $75,000 is $4,061 per year. Stanford graduates with more than 10 years of experience report average salaries of $143,100.\n\nAccording to PayScale, 51% of Stanford students major in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) field, a factor that contributes to high average salaries among graduates. And Stanford is known for providing robust financial aid. The average scholarship and grant total for students from families making less than $65,000 a year is $74,095 per year. Students from families making between $65,000 and $95,000 receive $65,050 on average in scholarships and grant aid.\n\nWhile Princeton, Harvard and Yale get top marks, a wide range of schools from across the U.S. are represented here. State schools like the University of Washington-Seattle, small liberal arts colleges like Pomona College and STEM-focused schools like MIT also appear on this list, indicating that you don’t have to attend the Ivy League to get a great return on your college investment.\n\nHere is CNBC Make It’s 2019 list of the top 50 U.S. colleges that pay off the most:\n\nThe top 25 private universities\n\n1.

Consider pursuing a degree in a high-paying field. Earning a degree in a STEM field can help students at any college prepare themselves for in-demand high-paying jobs. Students can keep costs low by keeping on pace with their requirements and graduating on time. Additional semesters of college can be expensive and in some cases, scholarship and grant aid does not apply for semesters beyond the standard four years.\n\nBut the most significant step students can take to ensure their college degree pays off is, simply, to complete their college degree. Just 60% of college students complete their bachelor’s in six years and many drop out altogether, and one of the worst outcomes for students is taking on loans for a degree they do not complete. The economic benefits of earning a bachelor’s degree are still significant, and if students study hard and play their cards right, college can pay off big time.\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled read", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}]}

The league is pushing for a full-season suspension instead.\n\nOn Monday, Watson was suspended for six games this season for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy in private meetings with massage therapists while he was with the Houston Texans.\n\nThe NFL had asked Sue L. Robinson, the former judge hired by the NFL and its players union to decide on Watson's punishment, for a suspension covering the 17-game regular season and the playoffs.\n\nNo player accused of non-violent sexual misconduct, as Watson has been, has received a suspension longer than six games, Robinson said in her 16-page ruling issued Monday.\n\n\"While it may be entirely appropriate to more severely discipline players for nonviolent sexual conduct, I do not believe it is appropriate to do so without notice of the extraordinary change this position portends for the NFL and its players,\" she wrote.\n\n\"The NFL notified the NFLPA that it will appeal Judge Robinson's disciplinary decision and filed its brief this afternoon,\" league officials said Wednesday. \"Commissioner Roger Goodell will determine who will hear the appeal.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the league announced Goodell had selected former New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey to hear the appeal, noting Harvey has arbitrated other cases and has advised the league on the \"development and implementation of workplace policies, including the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy.\" Harvey is also a consulting expert with the NFL's Diversity Advisory Committee, which helps improve racial and gender diversity throughout the league.\n\nWatson has repeatedly denied the accusations.\n\n\"I've never assaulted, I never disrespected, and I never harassed any woman in my life,\" Watson has said . \"I don't have any regrets.\"\n\nThe NFL Player's Association has already said it would not appeal. The union declined to comment Wednesday. The Browns also declined to comment.\n\nThe attorney of Watson's accusers said the NFL \"does not care about the rights of women\" following the Cleveland Browns quarterback's suspension for sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nAppearing Tuesday on ESPN's \"First Take,\" attorney Tony Buzbee attacked the investigation, saying he hopes the NFL will appeal the case, but his clients are angered and disappointed by the lenient suspension handed down by a disciplinary officer.\n\n\"Don't expect the NFL to do anything heroic here,\" Buzbee said.\n\nTwo grand juries in Texas declined to charge Watson with any crimes.\n\nWatson throws a pass during Browns training camp.\n\nTwenty-four civil lawsuits have been filed against Watson -- 23 have been settled confidentially.\n\nWatson's attorney Rusty Hardin told CNN he will not comment until after the NFL decides whether to appeal.\n\nJudge Robinson said she was suspending the 26-year-old for his \"predatory conduct.\"\n\n\"Although this is the most significant punishment ever imposed on an NFL player for allegations of non-violent sexual conduct, Mr. Watson's pattern of conduct is more egregious than any before reviewed by the NFL,\" Robinson wrote in the 16-page ruling.\n\nBut, despite those findings, Judge Robinson critiqued the NFL for asking for an unprecedented full-season suspension which would be far lengthier than other players accused of non-violent sexual conduct.\n\nOn Tuesday, Buzbee -- the attorney for the plaintiffs in the case against Watson -- told ESPN he hopes the NFL moves forward with an appeal because that gesture would be well received by the accusers.\n\n\"I think that would change the messaging and I think it would be well received by the women I represent,\" he said.\n\nIn her findings, Robinson wrote that her decision is limited by the record that was presented to her by NFL investigators who are former prosecutors with decades of experience investigating sexual assault cases. She noted that Watson had \"allegedly worked with more than 60 massage therapists\" during the period under consideration, and that the NFL had \"only investigated the claims of the 24 therapists suing Mr. Watson for damages.\"\n\nAnd of the 24, Robinson wrote that the NFL was only able to interview 12 alleged victims. They relied on the testimony of four of those 12 in the case presented to her for review.\n\nBuzbee attacked the way in which the investigation was conducted.\n\n\"None of my clients testified in front of the federal judge. I think that's a common misconception that four people testified. That's not the case. Not one of them showed up. Not one of them was asked to show up and testify,\" he said. \"Since those interviews, we have had no contact whatsoever with the NFL.\n\nBuzbee represents women in the civil cases against Watson, accusing him of sexual assault.\n\n\"They care about the bottom line. They care about making money,\" said Buzbee on ESPN.\n\n\"They're trying to manage this as a PR crisis, but as far as trying to do anything to assuage these particular women or women's rights -- or dealing with women's rights in general -- that's not part of their mission statement and they've made that very clear throughout this process.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling to suspend Watson for only six games.\n\n\"The 6-game suspension given dangerously mirrors the flaws in our criminal justice systems and sends a grave message to our communities,\" the organization said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. \"Far too often those in positions of power and celebrity who commit violence against others are not held accountable for their actions.\n\n\"These ongoing headlines are triggering for so many. To survivors, we say we see you and we believe you. Your story matters. Cleveland Rape Crisis Center is available 24/7/365 online or by calling/texting (216) 619-6192.\"\n\nThe ruling comes after a number of women who worked as massage therapists filed lawsuits against Watson alleging sexual assault or misconduct during massage sessions. Last month, 30 women who have made or intended to make claims against the Texans organization over Watson's alleged misconduct settled their claims, according to a statement from Buzbee and the Texans' ownership.\n\nWatson, a three-time Pro Bowler, did not play last season while a member of the Houston Texans because of a trade demand as well as the investigations into these allegations.\n\nDays later, the Browns traded three first-round picks for Watson and then signed him to a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history.\n\nWatson will not be paid during his suspension, but the Browns structured his new contract so his base salary is $690,000 his first year and then $46 million for each of the next four years, according to the salary tracking website Spotrac.", "authors": ["Ben Morse", "Jacob Lev"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/sport/deshaun-watson-nfl-intl-spt-cmd/index.html", "title": "Deshaun Watson: The NFL says it holds players to account for their ...", "text": "(CNN) It's been months since the Houston Texans agreed to trade embattled quarterback Deshaun Watson to the Cleveland Browns , but the furor over the deal -- described by one NFL observer as a case of \"talent trumps trouble\" -- just won't go away.\n\nIn March, a grand jury in Harris County, Texas, declined to charge Watson over allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct after determining there was not enough evidence to charge him with a crime. The incidents were described as \"stemming from massage therapy sessions,\" according to a statement on the NFL website.\n\nMeanwhile, a second grand jury in Brazoria County, Texas, in March declined to indict Watson after considering evidence in a criminal complaint alleging sexual misconduct, also during a massage therapy session.\n\nHowever, Watson still faces 22 civil complaints from his accusers, many of them alleging sexual assault and misconduct during massage sessions. Two of Watson's accusers appeared on HBO's Real Sports on Tuesday, providing graphic details of what they say happened in the sessions -- and speaking of their shock and revulsion at the news of his signing.\n\n\"It's just like a big screw you,\" Ashley Solis said on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.\"That's what it feels like. That we don't care. He can run and throw, and that's what we care about.\"\n\nWatson has repeatedly denied the accusations of sexual assault and misconduct made against him, and Watson's attorney Rusty Hardin said in a statement \"I believe that any allegation that Deshaun forced a woman to commit a sexual act is completely false.\"\n\nNFL officials were scheduled to meet with Watson last week, as the fallout from his trade continues, according to NFL.com , per NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport. A decision on his potential suspension is looming, but timelines for this remain unclear.\n\nHardin told CNN that Watson met with the NFL for three days. The league has also requested one more day, though the date and location have not yet been determined, added Hardin.\n\n\"I can't give you a timeline,'' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters in a press conference Tuesday. \"I think we're nearing the end of the investigative period and then at some point this will be handled by our disciplinary officer. And that will happen shortly. And then we'll see where that comes out.''\n\nDeshaun Watson #4 of the Houston Texans calls a play at the line of scrimmage during a game against the Tennessee Titans at NRG Stadium on January 03, 2021 in Houston, Texas.\n\nJournalist Melissa Jacobs, founder and managing editor of 'The Football Girl,' told CNN that after Watson's signing with the Browns, she felt \"disgust, disappointment, I guess, ickiness, but also not surprised at all because we saw the makings of this happening.\"\n\nWatson's five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract from the Browns would be the highest guaranteed money given to an NFL player, according to ESPN. If a player is fully guaranteed, money in a player contract is protected for skill, cap and injury. Cleveland is set to begin organized team activities on May 24.\n\nAt an introductory news conference with the Browns in March, when asked about his off-the-field situation, Watson answered: \"I don't have any regrets. Like I said before, the things that are off the field right now that came up caught me by surprise because I never did anything that these people are alleging.\"\n\nWatson's attorney Rusty Hardin told CNN he couldn't predict the outcome of the civil cases but added: \"We really strongly believe that he didn't do what he's accused of doing.\"\n\n\"I'm struck by the way people have just moved on without recognizing the significance of the law enforcement decision that there was no crime committed,\" he said.\n\nCleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski answers questions from the media during the NFL Scouting Combine on March 2, 2022, at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis.\n\nBrowns head coach Kevin Stefanski in March defended the decision to trade for Watson, saying, \"I think Deshaun's ready to make a positive impact on this community and I can tell you, just with my time spent with Deshaun in the past few days -- getting to know him and getting to know this person -- I'm looking forward to this community getting to know this person.\"\n\nHowever, some say the trade is hard to stomach given Watson still faces numerous civil suits regarding allegations of sexual assault and misconduct.\n\nOne of the civil suits filed called Watson a \"serial predator,\" and others also filed in April allege he \"assaulted and harassed\" the women by \"exposing himself\" or \"touching (them) with his penis.\" Another additionally alleges Watson tried to make one woman perform oral sex on him.\n\n\"It's not to say that Deshaun Watson should never be allowed to play in the NFL,\" added Jacobs. \"It's just that there's still civil cases ongoing and the NFL investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"So why not let the legal process play out? It's just one of the most in-your-face examples of 'talent trumps trouble' that I feel like the NFL has ever had.\"\n\nTesting the personal conduct policy\n\nWatson remains under investigation by the NFL -- though Commissioner Roger Goodell said there was \"no time frame\" on a decision by a joint disciplinary officer.\n\n\"Obviously, these are serious charges. We're looking at this seriously,\" Goodell told reporters in March.\n\n\"We now have obviously at least resolution from the criminal side of it. Obviously there are still civil charges that are going on. So our investigators hopefully will have access to more information, and that will be helpful obviously in getting to the conclusion of what are the facts and was there a violation of the personal-conduct policy,\" he said.\n\nUnder that policy, Goodell could choose to place a player on the exempt list \"when a player is formally charged with a crime of violence\" or when an NFL investigation \"leads the commissioner to believe that a player may have violated\" the policy.\n\nThe exempt list is a device the NFL can use to place players on paid leave while they are under investigation if it is thought they might have violated the league's personal conduct policy.\n\nWhat is the exempt list? The exempt list is a device the NFL can use to place players on paid leave while they are under investigation if it is thought they might have violated the league's personal conduct policy. Players can also be temporarily placed on the list if a \"violation relating to a crime of violence is suspected but further investigation is required\" to allow the league to conduct its own investigation. According to the NFL's personal conduct code, players found to have engaged in the following behavior will be subject to discipline -- \"even if the conduct does not result in a criminal conviction.\" Behaviors include: Actual or threatened physical violence against another person, including dating violence, domestic violence, child abuse, and other forms of family violence\n\nAssault and/or battery, including sexual assault or other sex offenses\n\nViolent or threatening behavior toward another employee or a third party in any workplace setting\n\nStalking, harassment, or similar forms of intimidation\n\nPlayers can also be temporarily placed on the list if a \"violation relating to a crime of violence is suspected but further investigation is required\" to allow the league to conduct its own investigation.\n\nRunning back Kareem Hunt was placed on the exempt list in 2018 after he was seen on video pushing and kicking a woman in a Cleveland hotel. He was released by the Kansas City Chiefs shortly after.\n\nThe Browns signed Hunt just months later, despite a league suspension hanging over his head. Weeks later, Hunt was suspended for eight games for violating the NFL personal-conduct policy, stemming from physical altercations at his Cleveland residence in February 2018 and at a resort in Ohio in June.\n\nAt the time of writing, a decision on Watson's playing status has not been made. He would, in theory, be able to play when the season begins in September, though a decision on a potential punishment or suspension is expected soon.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Trevor Bauer looks toward home during the fourth inning of the the team's baseball game against the San Francisco Giants on May 21, 2021, in San Francisco.\n\nA few weeks after Watson was traded to the Browns, another major US sports league showed its commitment to punishing players found to have violated its domestic violence and sexual assault policy. Major League Baseball announced in April it suspended Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer for two years (324 championship season games) without pay, for violation of the league's domestic violence and sexual assault policy following an extensive investigation. Bauer has consistently denied the allegations.\n\nIn February, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said Bauer would not face criminal charges for the sexual assault accusations.\n\nAs far as the NFL, commentators say the league's and teams' treatment of other players accused of wrongdoing works as a blueprint for how it regards a player's personal conduct.\n\n\"As far as actions off the field and what priorities are, I think that line was drawn a long time ago with any number of people you could point to that were brought back to help teams win games after various levels of transgression,\" Tim Benz, a sports columnist for the Tribune-Review, told CNN Sports.\n\n\"Whether it was Kareem Hunt or Michael Vick, or when Ben Roethlisberger was accused of sexual misconduct twice and was never actually charged with any crimes, he still got suspended for six games and was brought back and went on to have a career that they just honored him for for an entire year in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Josh Gordon's another example with their own drug policy, which he violated numerous times over, and every time you turn around, he gets a new job with someone,\" Benz added.\n\nNFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy told CNN that when \"players or personnel violate the policies they are held responsible and disciplined. If a player earns his way back to playing by serving a suspension and undergoing mandatory training and evaluations we will consider it,\" adding that that's what happened with Hunt, Vick and Roethlisberger, who had \"no further discipline issues.\"\n\nA \"continuous assault\" on women, rights groups warn\n\nSome women's rights organizations see the Watson case as a continuation of policies and an attitude that are damaging to women.\n\nRosa Beltré, executive director of the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence, told CNN that Watson's trade was \"disheartening, but it was not a surprise.\"\n\n\"This is a continuous assault, as well as revictimization, and it's been the position of many businesses and organizations,\" Beltré said.\n\nFootball teams' and leagues' behaviors often don't match their public messaging around violence against women, she said.\n\n\"While they can have campaigns , or they could go ahead and have their players give their time, talent, supposedly for a cause, the decisions that they make normally do not walk alongside their talk.\"\n\nShe said that \"over and over again,\" clubs and leagues have shown it is more important to win a championship and sell tickets than to punish players in order to demonstrate the importance of the team's values.\n\n\"So the message that they clearly sent is that once again: money, status, wins are more important than believing, supporting, seeing and recognizing the harm that is done against women by their athletes, by their boards, by their executives.\"\n\nLaura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, said in a statement to CNN: \"The survivors in this case have been vocal about how damaging it has been to witness the person who they reported for assault and abuse go without consequences and move on to achieve success and celebrated status in their personal and professional lives.\n\n\"What can be very powerful in honoring the experiences of these survivors is when we as a society recognize that people who commit acts of sexual violence sometimes abuse celebrity or authority status -- and the illusion of trust that comes with it -- to act in abusive ways and evade responsibility.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Buzbee, the lawyer for the women pursuing civil suits against Watson told CNN: \"The NFL is a joke, when it comes to this particular issue,\" and said he believes the NFL didn't take its internal investigation regarding Watson seriously.\n\n\"It didn't take me very long to figure out just in that process that the NFL wasn't serious about it. They're just not serious. They're serious about how many people you can put in the stands, how much merchandise you can sell, and how far you can throw the football. They're not concerned and are not serious about, you know, codes of conduct, things that are said, done, off the field,\" Buzbee said.\n\nDeshaun Watson #4 of the Cleveland Browns walks off the field after the Cleveland Browns OTAs at CrossCountry Mortgage Campus on May 25, 2022 in Berea, Ohio.\n\nHe said that in interviews between the NFL investigators and Watson's accusers: \"One of the very first questions asked is, 'What were you wearing?' That speaks volumes to me.\n\n\"As if, as if the women somehow were in the wrong because of something they wore at what was supposed to be a professional massage session.\"\n\nMcCarthy, the NFL spokesperson, told CNN \"the question related to what the women were wearing was to help get a full understanding of the incidents,\" and said the legal team for the women did not object to the question at the time.\n\n\"It was in no way intended to... make the women feel uncomfortable or assign blame,\" he added.\n\nBut some experts say the NFL's handling of cases like Watson's get in the way of breaking the cycle of violence against women.\n\n\"All too often our society, criminal legal system, and private institutions fail to hold those who commit sexual harassment, assault, and abuse accountable,\" Palumbo said. \"Whenever sexual harassment and abuse are not taken seriously and handled with impunity, this contributes to the cycle of future harm.\"\n\nBeltré agrees. \"You cannot talk about restorative justice or giving a person a second opportunity when they never claim or admit their wrongdoing, and they move on in life as if nothing has happened, which gives them more power and opportunity to continue hurting others.\n\n\"What the NFL and other organizations have seen is that talent is more valuable than the harm that he's causing with his behavior,\" she said.\n\nQuarterback Deshaun Watson of the Cleveland Browns speaks during his press conference introducing him to the Cleveland Browns at CrossCountry Mortgage Campus on March 25, 2022 in Berea, Ohio.\n\nMcCarthy told CNN the league has mandatory domestic violence and sexual assault training for everyone in the NFL, including players, coaches and staff, which were developed in conjunction with domestic violence and sexual assault experts.\n\nWatson's attorney Hardin said that the NFL had been \"totally responsible\" in the way they had handled things so far.\n\n\"What they tried to avoid is any suggestion by law enforcement, that by talking to potential witnesses and potential complainants or making accusations or so they might very well get in the way of and hinder the official criminal investigation.\n\n\"Law enforcement has always preferred that private agencies who are looking into the conduct of their employees wait to conduct their investigations until the official investigation is complete,\" he added.\n\nHe added that the NFL has now been \"very aggressively\" pursuing the investigation.\n\nMixed reactions among fans\n\nSome fans are angry about Watson's transfer. \"I think they care,\" Benz told CNN. \"I also think that they know if they win, (the anger will) go away.\"\n\nHe points to the past as evidence of this.\n\n\"There were a lot of people saying that they'd never root for the Steelers again after they brought Michael Vick in for a few weeks. I don't think that deadened the fan base in Pittsburgh by any stretch of the imagination.\"\n\nNationally, there has been a \"resurgence in TV ratings and streaming numbers in the NFL this year, after two or three years of many football fans saying: 'I'll never watch the National Football League again because of the national anthem controversy,\" said Benz, referring to player protests that began with Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand as the national anthem played before NFL games.\n\n\"That's disappeared,\" he added.\n\n\"As far as the Browns case in particular, there's a franchise that is starved, perhaps more than any of the National Football League, for a Super Bowl and a football-rabid community.\n\n\"And if Deshaun Watson ends up getting them there and winning them one, I don't think any concerns that the Browns might have about the reaction of the fan base will be a whisper in their ear by the time the Vince Lombardi Trophy is hoisted in Cleveland, should it come to that,\" he said.\n\nJacobs said the NFL's handling of similar situations points to a reactive, not proactive, strategy.\n\n\"I think the NFL is very interested in problems going away, and they're very reactive to issues like diversity, and back when the Ray Rice tape came out and there was so much anger out there, and that's when they instituted their policy,\" she said, referring to the former running back for the Baltimore Ravens, who viciously knocked out his fiancée Janay in a casino elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 2014 after a night of heavy drinking. The incident was captured on surveillance video.\n\nRice was indefinitely suspended by the NFL for violating its domestic violence policy -- a decision he successfully appealed, though no teams went on to sign him during his free agency.\n\n\"They're never on top of these things, like ever. Those parts of their history need to be written,\" added Jacobs.\n\nOnce a player has been punished, she said, some TV broadcasters rarely repeat why a sanctioned player has missed games, simply telling audiences, \"Oh, he was suspended for four games. Now he's back.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of a scandal and when a player is back on the field, \"it's more of the same,\" Jacobs said.\n\n\"They just sort of gloss over things to make it seem as if everybody is this wonderful, altruistic person,\" she said.\n\nMcCarthy told CNN that the league's official website (nfl.com) and TV network (NFL Network) report on every incident and suspension.\n\n\"After Ray Rice, there were PSAs out there,\" Jacobs said.\n\nLos Angeles-based filmmakers Made by Women Media created a public service announcement \"NO HITS\" calling on the NFL to \"stop tolerating abuse.\"\n\nIn 2014, following the furor over Rice's behavior, the union for professional football players, the NFL Players Association, put together a commission on domestic violence to give recommendations on how to tackle domestic violence and other issues facing the league. The NFLPA is an organization separate to the NFL.\n\n\"They had brought on an advisory committee and they went to educate players and especially men to stand up when they see something. And then that just went away,\" Jacobs said, adding that members of the commission quit because their recommendations weren't taken seriously.\n\nDeborah Epstein, one of the commissioners who resigned, said that she did so because of a failure by the union to act on recommendations.\n\n\"My NFLPA contacts would initially greet these ideas with a burst of enthusiasm and an indication of likely implementation, but efforts to follow up would yield nothing in the way of specific plans, and eventually communication would fade into radio silence,\" she wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington Post in June of 2018.\n\nJacobs made clear she isn't implying Watson is guilty.\n\n\"However, if you're going to allow the Deshaun Watsons of the world and people maybe in that 'probable, not definite but maybe' [category] then I do think, you as a league, have a responsibility to be open about violence against women, sexual assault, all those things like as a regular part of your programming.\n\n\"Again, talk about why these people were suspended, and offer programs to players. There just needs to be more invested into this [sports] world if you're going to allow potential perpetrators to exist in your league,\" she said.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt", "Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}]}

But it's not the only reason.\n\nNumerous factors are combining to push gas prices up to a record. Gas hit $4.25 for a gallon of regular gas, according to AAA's survey Wednesday.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired or economic sanctions imposed in Eastern Europe.\n\nNow, because so many factors are at play simultaneously, drivers should prepare to pay uncomfortably high gas prices through at least Labor Day. Prices could easily reach $4.50 a gallon before they start to retreat, and even a $5 per gallon national average is not out of the question.\n\nHere's what's behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China in 2021. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects oil prices around the globe, no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nDespite that carve out, much of Russia's oil is going unsold on global markets . Traders are reluctant to bid for it when it's not clear that any deal can be closed, given the sanctions on Russia's banking system. There have also been difficulties finding any tankers able or willing to call on Russian ports.\n\nThis has resulted in a de facto ban on Russian oil in global markets, with investors pricing crude as if the country's supply isn't available.\n\nThere is growing political pressure on the rest of Europe to join a formal ban on Russian oil . Russia supplies about 27% of the 27-nation EU's oil imports.\n\nWhile oil prices moved somewhat higher on the US and UK moves, a European ban could drive global prices up further due to concerns the restriction will stay in place indefinitely, even once the fighting in Ukraine stops. Oil is generally traded as futures pegged to delivery.\n\nThe price of a barrel of Brent crude, the closely watched benchmark used in Europe, closed Monday at $123.21, up 27% since the start of fighting just 12 days ago. West Texas Intermediary oil, the US benchmark,closed at $119.40 a barrel Monday, up 30% over the same timeframe.\n\nLess oil and gasoline from other sources\n\nUS oil companies don't follow those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns about the prospect of tougher environmental rules that could cut future demand. Many of those tougher rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\nJUST WATCHED How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient 01:40\n\n\"The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,\" said Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. \"People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.\"\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n\"They can't find people, and can't find equipment,\" McNally added. \"It's not like they're available at a premium price. They're just not available.\"\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives wanted to redirect cash to buying back stock and other ways to help their share price rather than increase production.\n\n\"Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,\" said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. \"They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial 'drill baby drill,' which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.\"\n\nNot only is oil production l agging behind pre-pandemic levels, there's also less US refining capacity. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be broken into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. And some companies are closing older refineries rather than invest the money it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd major US refineries have yet to return to full operation after two were damaged by hurricanes last year and another by an explosion\n\nStrong demand for gasoline\n\nJob gains have remained strong so far in 2022. And as many workers who have been working from home much of the last two years return to the office , demand is getting another boost.\n\n\"Jobs numbers have been pretty impressive and a lot of [workers] will be driving to work somewhere,\" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. \"There's also going to be more people not working remotely than there were last year or even last month. I don't know how to put a number on that, but that is certain to add to demand.\"\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel well. US trips in passenger vehicles have increased 25% since the beginning of this year, according to the mobility research firm Inrix.\n\nThere may not be quite as much commuting as before the pandemic. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, rather than five. The total number of jobs is still slightly below 2019 levels.\n\nBut there will be periods, most likely this summer, where there will be more demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic, Kloza predicts.\n\nTight supplies and strong demand were likely to push prices above $4 even without the current disruption caused by the war.\n\n\"Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,\" Kloza said. \"Now it's a question of how much we break the record by.\"\n\n-- CNN's Gregory Wallace contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/economy/may-inflation-gas-prices/index.html", "title": "Inflation rises at fastest pace in 40 years, pushed up by record gas ...", "text": "The reading for core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, posted a 6% increase over the same period, higher than the previous month's level. Both readings are among the biggest jumps in prices experienced by consumers since 1981.\n\nOverall, the increases were higher than forecast by economists, who had been expecting prices to jump by 8.3% over the 12 months ending in May, and which would have matched April's reading. This report dashed hopes that inflation had peaked earlier this year.\n\n\"Inflation is going higher and broader with a worsening outlook,\" said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. \"The probability of a recession in the next year or so is rising. Inflation is eating away at consumers' purchasing power. Since consumer spending accounts for about 70% of the economy, a real decrease in consumer spending would deal a big blow to the economy.\"\n\nThe typical US household is spending about $460 more every month than they did last year to purchase the same basket of goods and services, said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody's Analytics.\n\nEnergy prices rose 34.6% compared to a year ago, driven by a nearly 50% jump in gas prices over the last year. AAA's tracking of gas prices shows the price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide is now at $4.99, after setting records in 31 of the last 32 days. The June CPI report due next month is certain to show another big jump in gas prices.\n\nBut energy price hikes were not limited to the record gasoline prices. Electricity prices rose 12% over the last 12 months, the biggest annual increase since 2006. And the price of natural gas being used by consumers rose 30.2%, the biggest jump since 2008.\n\nThe higher energy prices alone added 2 percentage points to the overall CPI.\n\nIt's not just energy that is driving prices higher. The Labor Department said almost all the major components that make up the index showed increased prices.\n\nPrices for food purchased to eat at home rose 11.9%, the largest 12-month increase since 1979, with eggs up 32.2%, milk up 15.9% and poultry up 16.6%.\n\nThe shelter index, which measures rents and other housing costs, posted a 5.5% increase, its biggest 12-month gain since 1991. While that might not be as big an increase as the double-digit price hikes in other categories, the money that consumers spend on their home, whether renting or buying, is typically the largest expenditure they make each month.\n\nUsed car prices, which had shown signs of moderating with monthly declines over the last three months, rose once again, lifting prices 16.1% over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, new car prices are up 12.6% over the same period. A shortage of computer chips has curbed production at automakers, and that limited inventory is responsible for the rise in prices.\n\nthan 10%. In the last 12 months, airfares are up 37.8% and fares in May are 21.7% higher than in May 2019, before the pandemic caused a near halt in demand for air travel. Strong demand for air travel at the start of the summer travel season is also lifting airfares, which posted a one-month jump of 12.6% in May, the third-straight monthly rise of morethan 10%.

The continuing high pace of inflation means the Federal Reserve is all but certain to continue to aggressively raise interest rates when it meets next week.

Another half-point hike is likely at next week's meeting,with some forecasters now\n\n\"Inflation is proving to be more persistent than was widely believed a year ago, when transitory was the buzzword,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"The two key questions now? How far will the Fed go to knock inflation down, and how far can the Fed go without pushing the economy into recession?\"\n\nWhile the inflation report brought new attacks on the Biden administration from Republicans, the White House sought to blame the worst of the inflation on the rise in the price of oil and gasoline after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"Today's inflation report confirms what Americans already know. Putin's price hike is hitting American hard,\" President Joe Biden said at the Port of Los Angeles, where he was pausing from a regional summit to address what his team views as the most pressing current issue: high prices on everything from gas to groceries.\n\nBiden sought both to acknowledge the pain Americans are feeling, explain how he was looking to solve it and pin blame on others.\n\n\"I understand,\" Biden said. \"Inflation is a real challenge to American families.\"\n\nHe lambasted shipping conglomerates for raising prices and oil companies for their stock buybacks, singling out oil giant Exxon for making \"more money than God\" last year.\n\n-- CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/22/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html", "title": "Stocks week ahead: What if the Fed can't tame inflation? - CNN", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter.

All we are saying is please make it end.\n\nAmericans view inflation, which is near 40-year highs, as the top problem facing the country today by a very wide margin. No other concern comes close\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve, the central bank tasked with deflating inflation from 8.3% to its goal of around 2%, are now raising interest rates in an attempt to cool the economy.\n\nThat's okay: Medicine doesn't have to go down easy if it works fast and it works well. But inflation rates have been increasing sharply since August 2021 and have been out of the normal 2%-to-4% range for a full year. Now a growing distrust in the Fed's capabilities and a belief that they've become entangled in a policy error has raised the question: What happens if the Fed can't get inflation under control and we're stuck in a long term cycle of elevated inflation and recession?\n\nWhy it matters: Record high inflation has created a multi-layered crisis. At its core, it represents a political crisis for the Democrats defending their very tight majority in Congress, and a crisis of faith for economists who misjudged the persistence and significance of rising prices as a Record high inflation has created a multi-layered crisis. At its core, it represents a political crisis for the Democrats defending their very tight majority in Congress, and a crisis of faith for economists who misjudged the persistence and significance of rising prices as a \"transitory\" blip and may have missed their chance to get ahead of the curve.\n\nMost importantly, it's a crisis for the American wallet. The average price for a gallon of gas has surpassed $4 in all 50 states for the first time ever. Food prices were 9.4% higher in April 2022 than in April 2021, the largest annual increase in 41 years. Americans have seemingly shifted into survival mode: Target and Walmart reported last week that discretionary spending is easing as customers struggle to cover basics like food, fuel and shelter.\n\nThis is different: The Federal Reserve is likely borrowing ideas The Federal Reserve is likely borrowing ideas from its 1994 playbook , the last time the central bank successfully raised interest rates and executed a soft landing. But things are different now. We're dealing with a serious labor shortage caused by baby boomers ready to exit the workforce, a significant pandemic-reduced labor participation rate and a productivity slowdown. Globalization is in retreat as the pandemic and war in Ukraine have led to significant energy price shocks and supply chain disruptions.\n\n\"These are uncharted waters for all of us,\" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. \"Inflation hasn't been this high since the year I was born.\" The economy will recover, she said, but it's going to be a \"slow burn.\" Markets will continue to tumble, and prices will remain elevated for a while, she added: \"I think we might have to stay there for a little while. I don't know that we're going to bounce back out of it very quickly.\"\n\nTrust in the central bank is also lagging. Investors are calling for a three-quarter-point rate hike at the conclusion of the Fed's June meeting, despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assurances that an increase that high isn't on the table. Even former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said the central bank had erred in its approach to addressing 40-year-high inflation.\n\nPart of the lack of confidence stems from the increase in broad and fast social media and communications outlets --— and has nothing to do with what's going on at the central bank, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. A continuous real-time feed of news and analysts makes it easier to judge the Fed's actions and not their outcomes.\n\n\"You know them so much better now,\" said Silverblatt. \"You see all of the nooks and crannies.\"\n\nTiming is everything: Inflation rates don't always come down. Just look at the 1970s when the US economy suffered three recessions during which the underlying inflation problem never went away.\n\n\"Stagflation is probably the worst word of vocabulary for financial markets because it's the worst of both worlds. Inflation stays high and the economy slows,\" said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \"I think we're getting a whiff of stagflation now.\"\n\nBut the ghost of the 1970s lingers on in all Fed governors' minds, and they've said they'll ratchet up their hawkishness — no matter what it means for markets and the economy.\n\n\"The process of getting inflation down to 2% will also include some pain, but ultimately the most painful thing would be if we were to fail to deal with it and inflation were to get entrenched in the economy at high levels, and we know what that's like,\" Powell said in a recent Marketplace interview\n\nGrohowski says he sees inflation sticking for the remainder of this year and some of next, but that it is not yet entrenched in the economy and will come down by 2023.\n\nStill, sentiment is not the same for investors and consumers. Among economists and analysts, said Grohowski, \"there's the expectation that there will be some relief and that we're most likely right now living through peak inflation.\" But consumers are \"worried that today's inflation rates are going to continue for longer.\n\nThey may not be wrong. While prices for certain goods will fall quickly, energy and housing prices will likely remain high for some time, according to the Fed.\n\nWe don't think inflation is entrenched,\" said Grohowski. \"But we admit that there is concern, because parts of inflation are stickier than most economists and even the Fed expected.\"\n\nDavos is back and the world has changed\n\nThe World Economic Forum — which famously combines high-minded panels with flashy parties — is back in person in Davos, Switzerland, for the first time in two years. The conference aims to bring important people together to tackle pressing issues like inequality, climate change, the future of technology and geopolitical conflict. But the logic behind inviting some of the wealthiest people on Earth to solve these problems from a resort town looks even shakier these days.\n\nBillionaires added $5 trillion to their fortunes during the pandemic, according to a report from Oxfam published in January. The world's richest 10 men saw their collective wealth more than double. Meanwhile, tens of millions more people around the world were pushed into extreme poverty\n\nThe event takes place against the backdrop of the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades in both developed and many developing economies. Soaring food and fuel prices are already causing hunger and hardship, fanning instability, triggering protests and emboldening political insurgents.\n\nThe main event is likely to be a speech on Monday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is expected to participate via video conference.

Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/14/malcolm-airport-cat-caught-island-park-expansion-news-around-states/50489503/", "title": "Malcolm X, airport cat caught: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state on Tuesday closed a $509 million bond deal to help build two supersize prisons amid lawsuits by inmates bidding to block the project. The Alabama Finance Department confirmed that the bond sale, which had been approved last month, was finalized. The deal closure comes after criminal justice reform activists had strived for more than a year to disrupt the sale. But legal wrangling over the project is continuing through ongoing litigation. Gov. Kay Ivey and lawmakers approved the construction as a solution to Alabama’s ongoing prison woes. Critics of the plan argue that the state is ignoring the bigger issues – prison staffing levels and leadership – to focus on building projects. “The construction of new and modern correctional facilities is absolutely and undeniably necessary to support the safety of both inmates and staff, to improve mental health care, to provide space for vocational and rehabilitative programs, and ultimately to protect public safety,” Alabama officials said in a statement. “No eleventh-hour lawsuits by inmates or activists will halt these efforts, and the state intends to move to dismiss the lawsuits and to vigorously defend against the claims as being without merit.” Activists had tried to discourage the deal, calling it a cruel investment in mass incarceration.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some rain helped firefighters battling a wildfire that prompted evacuations. About a half-inch fell into early Monday, allowing crews to build more fire breaks to help control the wildfire started by lightning June 21. “It’s not really like a season-ending type of rain; it’s more like a slowing,” said Mark Enty, a spokesperson for a state firefighting team. The fire has been burning near the community of Anderson. Evacuation orders were place for all properties accessed by roads, trails or driveways on the west side of the Parks Highway from mileposts 269 to 275. The city of Anderson, located about 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks, is not under an evacuation order. At least one home has been confirmed to have been lost, and Enty said Denali Borough officials will make an official assessment of other structures. The fire was estimated to be 110 square miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Evictions in the greater Phoenix area have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The latest data from the Maricopa County Justice Court shows that landlords filed 5,792 evictions in June, compared with 5,669 in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums that slowed lockouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended. June also saw the highest number of monthly eviction filings since the pandemic began in spring 2020. A court spokesman emphasized that applications for rental assistance are still being accepted and encouraged tenants in need to apply.\n\nArkansas\n\nParagould: Jimmie Lou Fisher, who served as Arkansas’ state treasurer for more than two decades and was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, has died, a funeral home said. She was 80. Fisher died Monday at Arkansas Methodist Medical Center in Paragould, Mitchell Funeral Home said. A cause of death was not released. Then-Gov. Bill Clinton appointed Fisher as state auditor in 1979. She later served as treasurer from 1981 to 2002. “I will always remember that early October morning in 1991, when Jimmie Lou introduced me as I kicked off my presidential campaign on the steps of the Old State House,” Clinton said in a statement Tuesday. “As always, she was enthusiastic, caring and kind, saying just the words we all needed to hear.” He added: “She loved Arkansas and Arkansas loved her back. And she did a fine job as state treasurer.” Fisher ran for governor in 2002 and lost to Republican Mike Huckabee, capturing 47% of the vote. “She loved politics and was a faithful and fierce warrior for her party throughout her adult life,” Huckabee said Tuesday. A funeral service is scheduled for Thursday in Paragould.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill, who was ordered to pay attorneys’ fees to a British tabloid and two conservative journalists she sued after the publication of intimate photos without her consent, has filed for bankruptcy protection. If successful, the move could allow Hill to avoid paying about $220,000 in fees to the defendants, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Democrat who briefly represented a district north of Los Angeles had accused multiple parties in a revenge-porn lawsuit of violating the law by publishing or distributing the compromising photos. The lawsuit was thrown out, and a judge later rendered the financial judgments. Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She resigned in 2019 after the publication of the photos and amid a House ethics probe into allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her congressional staffers, which she denied. Hill, 34, gained national attention in 2018 when she was elected to Congress in a district long under Republican control. She was celebrated as the face of millennial change and was close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who allegedly made a threatening phone call against the state’s top elections official has been charged with retaliating against an elected official. Kirk Wertz, 52, was arrested June 6 in suburban Denver over the June 30 phone call to the office of Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold after investigators tracked his cellphone moving from Goodland, Kansas, to Colorado, according to a court document. Authorities have not revealed what the alleged threat was. His alleged statements to the person who answered the phone at Griswold’s office and to a state trooper who called the number back later were redacted from a document explaining why he was arrested. A spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney’s Office, Carolyn Tyler, confirmed that Wertz had been charged but declined to elaborate beyond what was included in the document. Wertz was being held in jail Friday after making his first appearance in court Thursday. There was no attorney listed as representing him yet in court records. In a statement, Griswold thanked law enforcement for taking action against Wertz and said threats would not deter her from carrying out her election duties. “The wave of violent threats directed at election officials and workers across the county is extremely concerning,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The wife of a former state lawmaker pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with her role in the alleged theft of more than $600,000 in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven. Lauren DiMassa, one of several people including her husband who were arrested in the investigation, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Hartford. Sentencing has not been scheduled. She remains free on bail. Federal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa, formerly known as Lauren Knox, nearly $148,000 for services she never provided to the city. She and her husband were accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services including youth violence prevention, but instead they used the money for their own benefit, prosecutors said. DiMassa’s lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that DiMassa turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband. O’Reilly declined to comment after the hearing. DiMassa’s husband is former state Rep. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council. He resigned from both positions after his arrest in October. He has pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the First State saw a slight decline in fatalities in 2020, a report released Tuesday still ranks Delaware among the deadliest states for pedestrians. Smart Growth America’s Dangerous by Design 2022 report analyzed federal crash and fatality data from 2016 to 2020 – the latest statistics publicly available – finding Delaware’s pedestrian fatalities declined slightly during the pandemic, averaging 2.89 deaths per 100,000 people from 2016-20. That represented a 0.42 decline in deaths per 100,000 people from 2016 to 2019, but long-term comparisons between rates from 2011-15 and 2016-20 show little change, keeping Delaware the fifth most dangerous state for pedestrians, the report shows. New Mexico was at the top with 3.76 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 people annually, followed by Florida with 3.22 deaths, South Carolina with 3.19 deaths and Arizona with 2.98 deaths, according to the report. Delaware has consistently ranked among the deadliest states for pedestrian safety, and over the past decade, the number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities on the state’s roadways has nearly doubled. The First State saw non-motorized fatalities increase from 21 in 2009 to 28 in 2020, according to the latest statistics available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. residents can now preregister for monkeypox vaccination appointments, WUSA-TV reports, citing a Tuesday announcement by DC Health. Once appointments become available, starting Thursday, people who preregistered will receive an email invitation to make an appointment. Residents will then have 48 hours to claim their appointment. About 3,000 appointments are expected to become available this week. Currently, eligibility for the vaccination is limited to adults in certain sexual circumstances that would increase their risk, based on where the virus has been circulating most heavily in the U.S. But residents who do not meet the current vaccine eligibility criteria are still encouraged to preregister. The monkeypox vaccinations are free and based on availability. At the appointment, confirmation of an appointment and proof of residency will be required.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: U.S. immigration officials say 25 Cuban migrants landed in South Florida on Tuesday – the latest arrival amid a mass migration from the island to escape political and economic troubles. The group was seen sitting off the side of the road by a beachside park in Key Biscayne in the early morning and included women and a few children, who were all taken into custody. Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said via Twitter it was a smuggling incident that was being investigated. Between last October and May, Customs and Border Protection officials have found and detained about 1,000 Cubans arriving in Florida. Meanwhile, as of Sunday, the U.S. Coast Guard said it had stopped more than 3,000 Cubans at sea since last October. The majority of Cubans continue to migrate by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 140,000 arriving since last October – a number that exceeds the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when more than 124,700 Cubans came to the U.S. Cuba is seeing its worst economic crisis in decades due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tightening of U.S. sanctions. Last summer, people staged massive protests, which ended in hundreds of arrests, according to nongovernmental groups.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLithonia: A man became trapped while trying to crawl down through a vent from a strip mall roof into a pizza restaurant Tuesday, forcing firefighters to slice open the vent to free him, police said. The man was taken to a hospital, and the extent of his injuries was unclear. Police told local news outlets that emergency responders cut open the vent where it extended upward from a pizza oven at a Little Caesars outlet in suburban Lithonia, about 15 miles east of downtown Atlanta. Brittany Davis, a U.S. Army recruiter, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution she could hear the man yelling for help when she arrived for work at a neighboring recruiting office. “I looked on the roof but couldn’t see anybody,” Davis said. She called 911. Davis said a Little Caesars employee told her he could hear the man’s voice coming from inside the oven. Davis said she went inside the pizza restaurant and spoke to the man, who reported he was in pain and having a panic attack. “I’m not sure what time the restaurant closes at night, but the oven still gives off heat after they close, I imagine,” DeKalb County Fire Cpt. Jason Daniels told WXIA-TV. “For him to get down into the pipe … he had to do it in a certain window of time when the oven was cool enough, and obviously nobody was there.” The man walked to an ambulance shortly after being removed and was taken to a hospital. Police did not identify him or announce any criminal charges.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island was given new land Tuesday in a deal that will protect and manage a pristine white sand beach and ocean bay area that is home to endangered and endemic species and to rare, culturally significant Native Hawaiian artifacts. Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit land preservation group, transferred its ownership of Pohue Bay and surrounding land to the National Park Service. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has the world’s largest and most active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Most of the coastline where the bay is located is made of ancient lava flows, black rock and sea cliffs that dart out into the ocean. Pohue Bay, a rare and idyllic oasis in an otherwise rugged landscape, is home to endangered hawksbill sea turtles, green sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other species found only in Hawaii. The area houses anchialine ponds – landlocked pools with a mix of fresh and salt water – where rare Hawaiian red shrimp called ʻōpaeʻula live. The area is also culturally significant because it has remains of ancient Hawaiian villages, petroglyphs, burial sites and the largest known abrader tool quarry in the state, according to the Trust for Public Lands. Abraders are ancient tools used for sanding, smoothing and grinding.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lame-duck Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has given a big pay boost to an administrative assistant who is also a top state Republican Party official in a move that could hinder the ability of the next lieutenant governor by significantly depleting the office’s budget before January’s power transition. In an email Monday, McGeachin informed the Idaho Division of Financial Management that Machele Hamilton would go from part time to full time and jump from $20,000 to $77,000 annually. Her hourly pay is an increase from $20 an hour to about $37 an hour. Her title in the new role is director of strategy and constituent services. She is also the first vice-chair of the Idaho Republican Party. Hamilton is making about $30,000 more than McGeachin’s former chief of staff, Jordan Watters, who resigned in March when McGeachin couldn’t stay within last year’s budget. It’s not clear why Hamilton is being paid so much more than Watters, whose chief of staff duties would likely have included everything in the title Hamilton was given. Hamilton answered the phone for McGeachin’s office Tuesday afternoon but said McGeachin wasn’t available. Hamilton declined to comment about her employment in the office, and McGeachin didn’t respond to a message left with Hamilton by the Associated Press concerning Hamilton’s employment.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A Wisconsin doctor has purchased two clinical buildings in northern Illinois where he plans to offer abortion pills as early as Friday at one location and surgical abortions within six months at the other site. The move comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last month. That led abortion providers in Wisconsin to stop the procedures while the courts determine whether the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions stands. Abortion remains legal in Illinois, making it a likely draw for residents of many other states in the Midwest and even the South. Dr. Dennis Christensen said he’s part of a group trying to revive abortion services in Rockford, in part to accommodate Wisconsin patients. Christensen is an obstetrician-gynecologist who has provided abortions in Madison and Milwaukee and is now mostly retired, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. He recently purchased a former acupuncture office for $75,000 and the former Animal Emergency Clinic of Rockford for $350,000, according to the Winnebago County records. The newly formed Rockford Family Planning Foundation is fundraising and is preparing the second site for surgical abortions, birth control and related care. “We feel like it’s absolutely essential for us to get open as quickly as possible,” said Jeanne Bissell, the group’s president.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Students across the state had small improvements in their English and math scores, with standardized test results released Wednesday indicating a tentative bright spot following years of pandemic-disrupted learning. Results for the spring 2022 ILEARN exam from the Indiana Department of Education show the statewide percentage of students meeting their grade expectations for math climbing to 39.4% from 2021’s 36.9%. The English proficiency levels rose to 41.2%, up from last year’s 40.5%. ILEARN was first implemented in 2019 to replace the state’s ISTEP exam for students from third to eighth grade. The state did not test students in 2020 because of COVID-19-related school shutdowns. Students with passing scores remain about 7 or 8 percentage points below 2019’s pre-pandemic pass rates. The 2022 report also says most grades saw slight increases in passing scores, with the exception of sixth and eighth graders, who saw minor decreases in English scores. All grade levels’ math proficiency increased at least 2 percentage points since 2021. Charity Flores, chief academic officer at the Department of Education, presented the findings to the Board of Education on Wednesday. This year marks the second year of recovery, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds declined Tuesday to say whether she would get behind a so-called red flag law in Iowa after a new bipartisan federal gun safety law would offer funding to states that enact them. Reynolds, a Republican, said she wouldn’t rule it out and plans to “take a look at everything.” But she also said that she believes red flag laws have not stopped some shootings in other states and that Iowa needs to have a “balance” that recognizes the rights of gun owners as it moves forward. “When we focus on one solution to the issues that we see with active shooters, we tend to, I think, not think about what other solutions are,” she said. “And we eliminate potential things that we can do right away.” Extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws, allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia currently have red flag laws in place. Many of those states are clustered in regions of the U.S. largely governed by Democrats, but some states run by Republicans such as Florida and Indiana also have them. Such laws have gained some bipartisan support, including among U.S. lawmakers as 29 Republicans joined Democrats to pass the federal gun safety law in late June.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas State Board of Education is looking to veteran teachers to help mitigate staff shortages this fall. The board on Tuesday passed a measure giving any retired educator who previously held a Kansas teaching license an easier pathway back into the classroom during the 2022-23 school year. The new transitional license option, intended for retired educators whose prior teaching credentials have been lapsed for at least six months, streamlines the process and eliminates application fees and professional development requirements needed for typical license renewals. Applicants will still have to pay $50 for a background check, since the state education department outsources that work. Over the past five years, teacher retirements ebbed, but they ticked back up in the past five years, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. In 2020, the agency recorded 785 educators as having retired, but in 2022, KSDE has reported a record-high 986 teacher retirements, said Shane Carter, director of teacher licensure. However, the department in the past few years has also seen a surge in the number of retired teachers who have renewed their teaching license, Carter said, more than doubling from 368 retired teacher renewals in 2020 to 766 in 2022.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A medical marijuana advisory team formed by Gov. Andy Beshear will hold a town hall on the issue Thursday evening in northern Kentucky. The Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee is traveling around the state to gather views on the issue and provide feedback to the governor’s office. The next town hall is set for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at Northern Kentucky University’s student union ballroom in Highland Heights, a statement from the Justice & Public Safety Cabinet said. Other meetings are set for Tuesday at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet in Frankfort and July 25 at Hopkinsville Community College. The first meeting was held July 6 in Pikeville. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey and Public Protection Secretary Ray Perry serve as co-chairs of the 17-member panel. It includes health care professionals, members of law enforcement and advocates for medical marijuana.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State authorities have once again been blocked from enforcing a near-total ban on abortion, this time under a judge’s order released Tuesday by a state court in Baton Rouge. Judge Donald Johnson’s order halts enforcement temporarily while lawyers for a north Louisiana clinic and other supporters of abortion rights pursue a lawsuit challenging the legislation. Johnson set a hearing for next Monday. State Attorney General Jeff Landry criticized the ruling in a series of posts on Twitter. “To have the judiciary create a legal circus is disappointing,” Landry wrote in one post. “The rule of law must be followed, and I will not rest until it is. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer for that to happen.” Kathaleen Pittman, director of the north Louisiana clinic that was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, expressed relief in a phone interview. Pittman said the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport is ready to resume counseling and abortions. Louisiana’s two other clinics are in the capital, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. “We look forward to arguing for a preliminary injunction before Judge Johnson next Monday and, in the meantime, we take solace in the fact that crucial healthcare for women has been restored in the state of Louisiana,” Joanna Wright, an attorney for the clinic, said in an email.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal circuit court has reinstated a ban on lobster fishing gear in a nearly 1,000-square-mile area off New England to try to protect endangered whales. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations last year that prohibited lobster fishing with vertical buoy lines in part of the fall and winter in the area, which is in federal waters off Maine’s coast. The ruling was intended to prevent North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340, from becoming entangled in the lines. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston vacated that ruling Tuesday. The circuit court sent the case back to the district court level but noted in its ruling that it does not think the lobster fishing groups that sued to stop the regulations are likely to succeed because Congress has clearly instructed the fisheries service to protect the whales. “Although this does not mean the balance will always come out on the side of an endangered marine mammal, it does leave plaintiffs beating against the tide, with no more success than they had before,” the court ruled.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Commercial and recreational fishermen woke up Sunday to new mako shark regulations from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to boost the number of the migratory predator. Michael Luisi, acting director of the department’s Fishing and Boating Services, said a zero retention limit was established for shortfin mako sharks in both commercial and recreational fishing. Prior to that, a very limited number of the species could be retained. Luisi said penalties for doing so would include “severe and hefty” fines for violators. “Most shark fishermen are going to be up on the regulations because they have to just go fishing,” said Mark Sampson, captain of the charter boat Fish Finder, based in Ocean City. “But your average guy that goes out to catch tuna or black sea bass might not have taken the time to learn shark regulations. So if he accidently catches one on his line, he won’t know if it’s a keeper or not. Those anglers are the ones that are the most frustrated with regulations.” After 40 years of being at the helm of a charter boat, Sampson remains busy with clients that do not always plan on coming back with a shark. For some, the experience is enough. The average season for shark fishing runs from mid-May to October, with mako sharks caught to mid-June.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A family’s beloved pet cat that’s been dodging airport personnel, airline employees and animal experts since escaping from a pet carrier at Logan International Airport about three weeks ago was finally caught Wednesday. “Whether out of fatigue or hunger we’ll never know, but this morning she finally let herself be caught,” an airport spokesperson said in a statement. The cat, named Rowdy, was given a health check and will be returned to her family. “I’m kind of in disbelief,” said her owner, Patty Sahli. “I thought, ‘What are the odds we’re actually going to get her back?’ But I got a call this morning, and I am just so shocked.” Rowdy’s time on the lam began June 24, as Sahli and her husband, Rich, returned to the U.S. from 15 years in Germany with the Army. When their Lufthansa flight landed, the 4-year-old black cat with green eyes escaped her cage, in pursuit of some birds. Soon Rowdy herself was on the receiving end of a chase, as her getaway set off a massive search involving airport and Lufthansa personnel, construction workers, and animal welfare advocates, as well as the use of wildlife cameras and safe-release traps. Despite numerous sightings, Rowdy always eluded her pursuers – but now, a little calm has been restored. “It was such a community effort,” Sahli said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: An effort to lock certain voting rights into the Michigan Constitution has taken a major step toward the fall ballot, eclipsing a rival campaign led by Republicans to limit absentee voting and add other restrictions. Promote the Vote, a coalition of 27 groups, submitted nearly 670,000 signatures Monday. While the signatures still must be validated by election officials, the petitions contain about 245,000 more names than necessary to qualify for the Nov. 8 election. The ballot question would expand voter rights by allowing nine days of in-person early voting, state-funded absentee ballot postage and drop boxes in every community. Promote the Vote is the same coalition that helped pass no-reason absentee voting and same-day voter registration in 2018. Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, said the campaign “observed the 2020 election, and even the 2018 election, and we see where there could be improvements.” In addition to increased access to early voting, the constitutional amendment would require 24-hour absentee ballot drop boxes in every community. Voters could also join a permanent list to have absentee ballots sent for every election. And it would require election audits to be conducted in public by state and county officials and certified based only on the official records of votes cast. Some portions are already in Michigan law, but the state has seen attempts at “manipulating the language in that law, and we want to make sure we close those loopholes,” Spencer said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local governments in the state are trying to find creative solutions to managing the cost of fueling their fleets of vehicles as gas prices remain high. With gas prices recently near $5 a gallon in the Twin Cities, municipal leaders are looking to keep police squad cars, fire engines, dump trucks and park equipment fueled, yet stay on budget. The city of Buffalo is urging carpooling and checking tire pressure on its vehicles to stretch a tank of gas. “We’re projecting we will be coming in over our fuel budget,” said Taylor Gronau, Buffalo’s assistant city administrator. “However, a lot of those trips are necessary and needed.” Several communities are trying to add more electric and hybrid vehicles to their fleets – only to find huge backlogs, the Star Tribune reports. Earlier this summer, Minneapolis started a program that gave home inspectors the option of taking e-bikes to job sites. It saved wear and tear on the vehicle fleet and cut the city’s gas consumption. Several other city agencies, including IT and public works staff, are also looking into e-bikes. While dozens of local governments are under state fuel contacts, which cover a majority of fuel purchases in bulk and at a fixed rate, many other communities don’t participate, including Buffalo, which relies on retail gas stations to fuel its fleet.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearl River County: A volunteer fire department lost the use of three trucks when its own station went up in flames. WLOX TV reports the fire happened Monday night at the Nicholson Volunteer Fire Department station. Nicholson is a community in Pearl River County, near the Gulf Coast and the Louisiana state line. Five neighboring firefighting agencies assisted in fighting the blaze. Three trucks were heavily damaged, according to the TV station. And a county press release said several other pieces of key firefighting equipment were destroyed in the fire. Former Nicholson fire Chief Bobby Robbins estimated the damage at $1 million and said it could take roughly 100 days to have the equipment replaced. There were no injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Robbins said the trucks were donated by Deep South, a company from which the team is now considering renting. The Pearl River County Fire Marshal said officials are working with other agencies in the meantime to borrow equipment. Authorities must determine how the fire started as well as how to provide immediate protection in Nicholson without the fire trucks, equipment and a usable firehouse.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Developers announced plans Monday to expand the capacity of a controversial wind power transmission line so much that it would match that of four new nuclear power plants. Invenergy Transmission, the Chicago-based company attempting to build the Grain Belt Express, now says the project will be able to deliver 5,000 megawatts of power, about 25% more than originally planned, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Investment in the project, which would stretch about 800 miles from Kansas to Indiana on a route crossing Missouri and Illinois, also would soar to about $7 billion, Invenergy said. Various municipal utilities in Missouri have long intended to buy power from the project, but now five times as much electricity will be delivered to the state – rising from 500 to 2,500 megawatts, compared to earlier plans. The project will help unlock $7.5 billion in energy cost savings in Missouri and Illinois, according to its developers. The Grain Belt Express has the support of several area advocacy groups, including the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and the Associated Industries of Missouri. But some farmers who don’t want high-power transmission lines on their land have fought the project.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: The scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park opened for the 2022 summer season Wednesday after a spring marked by heavy snow and cool temperatures delayed plowing and maintenance work, park officials said. The July 13 opening matches the road’s latest opening dates since it first opened to the public on July 15, 1933. The alpine highway also opened July 13 in 2011 due to a late snowpack and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vehicle reservations are needed to travel on Going-to-the-Sun Road and can be obtained at the recreation.gov website. The $2 timed entry reservation fee is in addition to the $35-per-vehicle park entry fee. Timed reservations are also needed to enter the North Fork area, but they are not needed to enter other parts of the park such as Many Glacier, Two Medicine, St. Mary or the Chief Mountain Highway. The park’s free shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road operates on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Supporters of the late Malcolm X are making a new push to get him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The Omaha native was nominated 15 years ago but rejected amid concerns of controversy, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A Malcolm X Memorial Foundation board member submitted a nomination for the next class of honorees – selected every five years – for the human rights activist, who was born as Malcolm Little in 1925 and was assassinated in 1965. JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike called him “one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history,” according to the World-Herald, and putting him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame would push “the rest of the state to know about the true civil rights history of Omaha.” Malcolm X is one of eight Nebraskans nominated this year. New members may only be named at least 35 years after their deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno is expecting fall enrollment to match numbers from a year ago – still down from pre-pandemic levels, when the campus saw record enrollment of 21,000 in the fall of 2019. “We are all least even where we were last year,” UNR President Brian Sandoval said. At UNR, fall 2020 enrollment, including non-degree-seeking students, was 19,961. It climbed to 20,129 in fall 2021. The state’s seven colleges – including Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas – have all felt the effects of closing campuses and moving classes online. Enrollment systemwide topped 112,427 in the fall of 2019, according to data from the Nevada System of Higher Education. In 2021, enrollment was 106,259. Spring 2022 enrollment was estimated at 95,446 across the seven institutions. Among the factors affecting enrollment, Sandoval said, are the hardships students experienced from COVID-19, travel restrictions including for foreign students, and fewer Californians enrolling as the neighboring state has dramatically increased its admissions. “Students are challenged on a lot of levels,” Sandoval said, adding that housing prices and inflation are also affecting how many can afford higher education.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge has consolidated hundreds of lawsuits alleging physical and sexual abuse at the state’s youth detention center, more than two years after the first case was filed. David Meehan sued the state, the youth center, agencies that oversee it and multiple former employees in January 2020, alleging he endured near-daily rapes and beatings at the Youth Development Center in Manchester in the 1990s. At the time, he was one of about three dozen men and women who had come forward, but since then, about 450 have filed lawsuits alleging abuse by 150 staffers over six decades. The civil litigation has largely been on hold since 11 former youth workers were arrested last year, but a judge last week kicked it into high gear with an order setting out the consolidation process. While consolidation brings the “the risk of cookie-cutter dispositions,” proceeding with individual cases would present a “backbreaking clerical burden” for the court, said Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Andrew Schulman. The state is expected to produce more than 3 million pages of documents in the initial discovery phase. Discovery likely will take several months, and groups of cases will be combined for joint trials, lawyers said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A new “strike force” within the state attorney general’s office will aim to enforce New Jersey laws that protect the right to an abortion, working to make sure that patient confidentiality and personal health information are secure and that patients and providers are not threatened or intimidated by protesters. The Reproductive Rights Task Force announced Monday by acting Attorney General Matt Platkin is intended to ensure the full implementation of laws that give New Jersey some of the strongest protections for abortion rights in the United States. As other states ban or severely restrict abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the 49-year constitutional right to an abortion in the United States, New Jersey is expected to become a haven for people from those states who are seeking the procedures. Two laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on July 1 bar the extradition of people who receive or perform an abortion in New Jersey to those states that restrict or criminalize the procedure and prohibit public agencies from aiding investigations conducted by those states into abortions provided in the Garden State. The new group of attorneys and law enforcement officers within New Jersey’s Department of Law and Public Safety “will ensure that these laws are enforced to the full extent possible, and that we use every available resource to protect access to abortion care in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Physicians and researchers are urging state lawmakers to allow the use of psychedelic mushrooms in mental health therapy aimed at overcoming depression, anxiety, psychological trauma and alcoholism. A legislative panel on Tuesday listened to advocates who hope to broaden the scope of medical treatment and research assisted by psilocybin, the psychedelic active ingredient in certain mushrooms. Oregon is so far the only state to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin. Recent studies indicate psilocybin could be useful in the treatment of major depression, including mental suffering among terminally ill patients, and for substance abuse including alcoholism, with low risks of addiction or overdose under medical supervision. Physician Lawrence Leeman, a medicine professor at the University of New Mexico, urged legislators to move forward without waiting for federal decriminalization or regulatory approval to expand responsible therapies using doses of psilocybin. Leeman and other advocates outlined emerging psilocybin protocols, involving six-hour supervised sessions and extensive discussions about the experience in subsequent counseling. He warned legislators that public interest is spawning illicit, underground experimentation without safeguards.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Soaring demand for the monkeypox vaccine caused the appointment system to crash in New York City, one of many places where supplies have been running out almost as soon as they arrive. City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the vaccine and vowed to build a “stable appointment infrastructure” as the vaccine supply increases. U.S. infections now exceed 1,000 from the growing outbreak. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. Vaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection, regardless of their sexual orientation. “After COVID, this should have been easy,” said Daniel Ross, 25, a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday. “I kept refreshing and refreshing. … I was frustrated.” Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal, which went down minutes after it went live. “It’s going to haunt me,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Local Republicans are planning a 30-day raffle of guns and ammunition, a move that’s drawing criticism in light of recent mass shootings across the U.S. The Forsyth County Republican Party will offer semi-automatic weapons, among other guns, in the raffle, the Winston-Salem Journal reports. Organizer Vernon Robinson said each raffle ticket will bear a three-digit number the purchaser can check each day against one of the games in the North Carolina Education Lottery from Sept. 9 through Oct. 8 to determine the winner. “The biggest problem with raffles is that the buyers can’t be sure the folks who are conducting it are playing it straight with the numbers,” Robinson said. “The way we solve that problem is to use the N.C. Education Lottery’s daily Pick 3 numbers.” A lottery spokesman said the agency does not know of any law that prevents other groups from using publicly released drawing numbers to decide their own raffles. Robinson said he hopes the fundraiser will net the party some $9,000 to $10,000 to “beat Democrats.” “The only people who are upset about gun raffles are people who are hostile to guns and gun owners,” he said. Kevin Farmer, chairman of the Forsyth County Democratic Party, said the move was “disappointing but, given the extremist nature of the Republican Party, not at all surprising.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State Attorney General Drew Wrigley on Tuesday rejected calls to release body camera footage of a fatal police shooting in Fargo and said he will personally oversee the case himself. Wrigley’s announcement came a day after family members and their supporters demanded to see video in the death of 28-year-old Shane Netterville, of Jamestown. About 50 people gathered Monday evening outside Fargo City Hall in a protest organized by a Native American group. Wrigley said the footage will be made public once all the proceedings are complete. “As a matter of course, law enforcement does not release evidence to the media for public consumption,” he said, noting there are only limited exceptions. Officer Adam O’Brien, an 11-year veteran of the department, shot Netterville on Friday after police responded to a report of people slumped over in a van. A police report said when officers arrived and tried to make contact with the occupants, the vehicle began to travel directly toward officers, and O’Brien fired. Netterville was driving the van, which police said had been reported stolen. Another man was arrested at the scene after he reportedly ignored commands of officers and was found to have methamphetamine. A third person who fled the scene was apprehended Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Division of Police will refer for internal review only one of 24 alleged misconduct cases during the 2020 racial injustice protests presented by an investigative team, police said Tuesday. Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement that she would only be referring one sergeant to the Internal Affairs Bureau for an administrative investigation. The referrals came after an investigation by retired FBI agent Richard Wozniak and Columbus Special Prosecutor Kathleen Garber, who were tasked in 2020 with looking into alleged criminal misconduct by officers during protests in May and June following the murder of George Floyd Jr. by then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. In the statement, Bryant said she “immediately put together a team” to see which, if any, of the cases could be investigated further. Bryant noted that any administrative investigation must also comply with the contract with Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, which mandates that all investigations occur within 90 days of the receipt of the complaint. Only one case fell within the 90-day time frame because the clock was stopped while the sergeant’s conduct was under a criminal investigation, Bryant said in the statement. The criminal investigation concluded May 27.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: People who believe they are descendants of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre can now provide genetic material to help scientists when they begin trying to identify remains of possible victims. Danny Hellwig, laboratory director with Intermountain Forensics, said Wednesday that researchers are not ready to begin trying to match DNA for identification, but an outpouring of requests from local residents on how to provide genetic material led them to begin the process of accepting donations. “That’s what prompted this,” Hellwig said. “We didn’t expect the amount of support and willingness to help … people have jumped out of the woodwork” to offer their DNA for testing. Black people who had ancestors in Tulsa in 1921 are sought, Hellwig said. “What we need is to populate these databases with family lines” of direct descendants, making identifications of the remains possible within days, Hellwig said. “If we’re only matched with very distant relatives, it can take much longer,” with previous efforts to make such matches taking four years or more, he said. The Salt Lake City nonprofit foundation is examining 14 sets of remains removed from a Tulsa cemetery a year ago and has said at least two of the remains contains enough usable DNA for testing for possible identification.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Far-right Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson’s trial started this week on one count of felony riot in connection with a brawl outside a Portland bar in 2019. Jury selection began Monday and is scheduled to continue through Thursday, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Prosecutors allege Gibson instigated a street fight between Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists May 1, 2019, at the now-closed bar Cider Riot. In an arrest warrant affidavit, Deputy District Attorney Brad Kalbaugh said video of the brawl shows Gibson and his two co-defendants “taunting and physically threatening members of the Antifa group in an effort clearly designed to provoke a physical altercation.” Three other brawl participants with the Patriot Prayer group, Chris Ponte, Ian Kramer and Matthew Cooper, were indicted and pleaded guilty. Kramer, who knocked a woman unconscious and fractured her vertebrae with a baton, pleaded guilty to riot, assault and unlawful use of a weapon. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and five years of probation. Ponte, who prosecutors said threw a rock and hurt a woman, pleaded guilty to a riot charge in a plea deal. He was sentenced to three years probation and 10 days in jail. Cooper pleaded guilty to riot and was sentenced to three years’ probation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor tweeted he had “big news” Tuesday, announcing the state budget passed in recent days includes funding for three new state parks. Gov. Tom Wolf’s press secretary, Beth Rementer, subsequently said the park sites haven’t been chosen, but work to identify and purchase the land is underway by the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The state’s 2022-23 spending plan includes $56 million to add the new state parks to what is currently a 121-park system. The three will be the first new state parks in Pennsylvania since 2005, not counting Washington Crossing, which was transferred from the state Historical and Museum Commission. The money will also help develop the state’s first park for the use of all-terrain vehicles and similar motorized recreational vehicles. “Our beautiful state parks are among the finest in the nation,” Wolf tweeted. “I’m proud that we secured funding in this year’s budget to make this investment in our park system.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman who authorities say pretended to be a decorated Marine Corps veteran with cancer to fraudulently collect about $250,000 in veterans benefits and charitable contributions has agreed to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Sarah Jane Cavanaugh, 31, of East Greenwich, signed an agreement in U.S. District Court in Providence under which she will admit to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of medals, U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said in a statement. She has also agreed to pay more than $82,000 in restitution. She faces more than 20 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of sentencing guidelines, according to court documents. Cavanaugh’s attorney, Kensley Barrett, said Tuesday that while he appreciates the interest that the case has garnered, he has no comment at this time. There is no record of Cavanaugh ever serving in the U.S. military, according to authorities. However, she did work as a licensed social worker for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence. Through her job, she gained access to documents, personal information and medical records belonging to a real veteran with cancer, which she used to create fraudulent documents and medical records in her name, prosecutors said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawyer for disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh said Tuesday that investigators have indicated they intend to pursue murder charges against him for the deaths of his wife and son, who were fatally shot outside their home more than a year ago. Lawyer Jim Griffin said in a statement that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division told Murdaugh family members they plan to seek indictments from a grand jury later this week. “We won’t have any comment until charges are actually brought against Alex,” Griffin said. Officials with both state police and the attorney general’s office would not comment on whether authorities were pursuing the indictments, which were first reported by news and opinion website FITSNews. Murdaugh already faces dozens of criminal charges that have piled up in the months since his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed. But until now he has not been charged in connection with their deaths; he’s repeatedly denied any role in those killings. The deaths led to at least a half-dozen investigations into Murdaugh and his finances resulting in charges that he stole $8.5 million from people who hired him and that he lied to police in saying he was shot by a stranger on a roadside when – officials say – he really asked a friend to kill him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Citizens who called the National Weather Service concerned about some “silvery objects” in the sky around the city this week prompted the agency to tweet that the objects were not aliens but rather test balloons launched by a South Dakota aerospace subsidiary. “Sorry, not aliens,” the NWS tweeted in response to the calls it received. The high-altitude balloons were launched by Raven Aerostar, a subsidiary of Raven Industries. “As a South Dakota company and the world leader in stratospheric balloon technology, our team conducts stratospheric balloon flights throughout the year, and many of them are launched from our dedicated hangar near Baltic,” Aerostar president Jim Nelson said. “Two of our Thunderhead Balloon Systems are currently over Sioux Falls.” The balloons, which look like hot air balloons, operate miles above the surface of the earth. Once a balloon reaches the stratosphere, it changes from a teardrop to a pumpkin shape, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Aerostar said the balloons have a variety of uses, including monitoring wildfires, expanding cellular networks and military reconnaissance. They navigate by autonomously changing altitude to take advantage of wind currents in the atmosphere.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is increasing its investment by $1.4 billion for a strategic plan that includes programs advancing the study and treatment of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases, the hospital said Wednesday. The additional funding is part of a six-year expansion plan that launched last year, and it will raise the six-year operating and capital budget to $12.9 billion, the Memphis-based hospital said in a news release. New funding will affect scientific operations, clinical care, global medicine and infrastructure. The number of new jobs will increase from from 1,400 to 2,300, while funds for construction, renovation and capital needs will rise from from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the hospital said. As part of the expansion plan, more investment will be seen in areas including structural biology, advanced microscopy, data sciences, global childhood cancer care, and collaborative projects involving St. Jude and scientists across the U.S. and the world, the hospital said. Additional funds also will be used on construction projects including Domino’s Village, a 140-unit housing facility; the Family Commons, a treatment-free zone for patients and their families to rest and enjoy themselves; and two 15-story towers dedicated to patient care and clinical research, St. Jude said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas student leaders are advocating for campus officials to “protect reproductive rights” and take action in response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last month and the state’s ban on abortions. A statement released by the student-run UT Coalition for Reproductive Justice and Rights on Tuesday includes a series of demands, including calling for UT leadership to expand sex education and reproductive health care resources, support adding an emergency contraceptive vending machine on campus, and advocate for reproductive health care access. “We unequivocally support reproductive rights, justice, and autonomy for all. The right to control our bodies and the ability to make healthcare decisions that should be private should not belong to any government or anyone other than ourselves,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with all abortion-seekers affected by this decision.” Sameeha Rizvi, vice president of the student-run UT Senate, said the coalition published the statement to emphasize “the lack of response from the university” to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She said students believed that collective action would help persuade UT to potentially take action on the demands.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man is in custody after police say he admitted attempting to hang one man and killing another as part of a “purge” that he claimed was directed by a higher power. Christian Francis Taele, 28, was arrested after police responding to a report of an assault found the 23-year-old victim strung from a piece of gym equipment at an apartment complex in Ogden on Saturday evening. It was unclear if Taele had an attorney who can speak on his behalf. KSL-TV reports he is being held for investigation of attempted murder. Witnesses said Taele, of Lake Shore, approached the victim, strangled him with a rope or strap, and kicked him numerous times before dragging him into the gym. The man was hospitalized and had no signs of brain activity. “The attack was unprovoked, and there is no indication that either the suspect or victim have ever spoken prior to the attack,” police wrote in an affidavit. While Ogden police were interviewing Taele, investigators say he confessed to a homicide in Spanish Fork and provided details of the slaying and the crime scene that had not been publicized. In that case, the body of 49-year-old Ryan Hooley was found next to a trash bin Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Leaders of the Vermont Army National Guard are investigating allegations of misconduct in recent months following a report made public last year on the Guard’s culture and policies. Vermont Adj. Gen. Greg Knight said in a statement Monday that he could not elaborate on the investigations but that it’s critical for members to know that “all members are, and will continue to be held accountable regardless of rank or position.” “I am disappointed that poor decisions and behavior continue to happen, but am glad to see our members report bad behavior when they see it,” he said. In November 2019, Knight requested an assessment by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations. The 113-page report released last year found the Vermont National Guard’s sexual assault polices lacked specifics to ensure compliance, a prevention program had inadequate resources, and many personnel perceived favoritism and a “good old boy” network. The investigation concluded that “the command climate and culture within the VTNG is generally sound, though there is room for improvement,” and made 35 recommendations. “Our people are by far the most important part of our organization,” Knight said in the statement. “These investigations are a result of our people trusting the process, and reporting aberrant behavior to the chain of command.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWhitewood: Flooding in a remote pocket of southwest Virginia has damaged more than 100 homes and left some 40 people unaccounted for, but there are no confirmed deaths or injuries, authorities said Wednesday. First responders in Buchanan County began receiving reports of rising water and damage Tuesday night, authorities said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. After daybreak, crews conducted aerial surveys to examine the extent of the disaster. Several small communities in the Virginia county that borders West Virginia and Kentucky were affected, according to the sheriff’s office. About 40 people – a mix of adults and children – were reported unaccounted for, but that number was expected to decrease as swift-water rescue teams continued to survey the area, authorities said. A shelter was established at a local school. Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Eric Breeding said the number of persons unaccounted for was based on relatives trying to contact a resident in an area where there may be limited or no phone service. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in trouble or in danger. They’re just letting us know that we need to check on these people,” Breeding said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, prosecutors said. According to King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office spokesperson Casey McNerthney, a judge on Monday ordered the 48-year-old man to remain jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail but denied prosecutors’ request for an anti-harassment order protecting Jayapal, The Seattle Times reports. In 2016, Jayapal became the first Indian American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Seattle police arrested the man outside Jayapal’s house at 11:25 p.m. Saturday after she called 911 and reported an unknown person or people were in a vehicle using obscene language, a probable cause statement said. She told a dispatcher her husband thought someone may have fired a pellet gun, the statement said. Officers arrested a man who was standing in the middle of the street with his hands in the air and a .40-caliber handgun holstered on his waist, the probable cause statement said. A neighbor told police she heard the man yell something to the effect of “go back to India, I’m going to kill you,” the statement said. The neighbor also said the man drove by Jayapal’s residence at least three times, yelling profanities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A helicopter crash last month that killed six people occurred when the aircraft hit a rock face 15 minutes after takeoff from a local airport, federal investigators said in a preliminary report Tuesday. The Vietnam-era Bell UH-1B “Huey” helicopter struck the rock face in an area about 4 miles from Logan County Airport in Amherstdale, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in the report. The cockpit and cabin then crashed into a roadway and a guardrail and were consumed by fire. Investigators have not yet released any information about the cause of the accident. A final report could take a year or two to complete, they said. The June 22 flight was the last scheduled for the day during a multiday reunion for helicopter enthusiasts where visitors could sign up to ride or fly the historic Huey helicopter, described by organizers as one of the last of its kind still flying. The helicopter was flown by the 114th Assault Helicopter Company, “The Knights of the Sky,” in Vinh Long, Vietnam, throughout much of the 1960s, according to the website for MARPAT Aviation, a Logan County flight school that operated the helicopter. After the Huey returned to the U.S. in 1971, the website says, it was featured in movies such as “Die Hard, “The Rock” and “Under Siege: Dark Territory.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A federal judge is siding with the Sun Prairie School District in a lawsuit filed by two Black parents who objected to their children’s middle school assignment that asked students how they would punish a slave in ancient Mesopotamia. Dazrrea Ervins and Priscilla Jones claimed the Black History Month assignment in February 2021 violated their civil rights as well as those of their children. The question was not part of the school district’s curriculum on ancient Mesopotamia. Three teachers came up with the assignment on their own, according to an internal investigation. The teachers were placed on administrative leave and later resigned, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Along with complaints about the assignment, the lawsuit also accused the district of discriminating against one of the children for his learning disability and failing to protect him from racist bullying. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, in Wisconsin’s Western District, said the parents failed to show evidence that their civil rights or those of their children were violated by the assignment. “A reasonable jury certainly could find that its content and timing were offensive, insensitive and justifiably upset students and their families,” Peterson wrote. “But a hostile environment claim requires much more than a single upsetting episode.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local search and rescue responders are hoping to raise donations for a helicopter and secure county support to cover operational costs, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr announced the campaign Monday, saying the county’s search and rescue team responded to a record number of calls for service last year, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/22/titanic-auction-legos-mighty-mississippi-news-around-states/39794949/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state’s busiest airport is partnering with a company that can identify passengers through eye scans and fingerprints. Al.com reports that Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport recently added kiosks offering the technology for a fee. CLEAR offers a $15 per month membership, paid annually, with various discounts for family members. After the biometric identification, passengers move to the front of physical security screening. The company says its technology is available at more than 60 airports, stadiums and other locations.\n\nCorrections & clarifications: In a previous version of this story, it erroneously stated what CLEAR members do in the security line. CLEAR is not involved with physical security. The article also incorrectly stated the number and types of locations where CLEAR is available. The program is available at more than 60 airports, stadiums and other locations.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Alaska has become the only state without an arts council following a loss of funding through state budget cuts. The Kodiak Daily Mirror reports that the closure of the Alaska State Council on the Arts last week means a $2.8 million loss of arts funding in the state. Although only $700,000 is state funding, another $2.1 million consists of federal funds through matching grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and private foundation support. Officials say those funds will no longer be available without the state council as a connecting vehicle. Officials say Alaska residents’ federal taxes will still help pay for the arts in other states through the NEA, but those funds will not contribute to the arts in their own communities.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A program that prioritizes drug treatment over jail time is credited with keeping people out of jail and saving taxpayers some money. The Arizona Daily Star reports more than 500 people struggling with opioid addiction were sent to a grant-funded Pima County “deflection” program in the past year. Based on jail booking costs, taxpayers saved $178,000 in the fiscal year that ended June 30. The effort began a year ago as a six-month pilot program in two divisions of the Tucson Police Department. Officers could recommend a suspect caught with 2 grams of opioids or less for treatment instead of arrest. Authorities say the program proved successful with nearly 120 people getting “deflected.” The county has since received $1.4 million in federal funds to expand the program.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Northwest Arkansas cities are figuring out how to handle the arrival of electric scooters, and the process will be evolving, officials say. A state law set to take effect Wednesday authorizes electric scooters vendors to set up shop in any Arkansas city. The scooters are battery-powered, have two wheels and a T-shaped handlebar and a floorboard. Riders pay to unlock them through a mobile app. The law says riders must be at least 16, and scooters have a maximum speed of 15 mph. The law allows municipalities to establish reasonable regulations for the safe operation and presence of the scooters on public property, but not ban them from the public right of way. Fayetteville’s City Council first took up a draft of an ordinance to regulate the devices July 2. Scooter companies will have to apply for a permit, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: The Sonoma County Fair has eliminated the pig scramble from Farmers Day because of rising public concern and protests over animal welfare. In the long-running event at the fair, youngsters chased and tried to capture piglets weighing 40 to 60 pounds. Officials say this year’s event Aug. 4 will instead include elementary school children carrying watermelons slicked with vegetable oil around an obstacle course in a timed race. The board president says the decision reflects a “heightened awareness” toward calls for humane treatment of farm animals at the fair 55 miles north of San Francisco.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: State wildlife officials are telling people near the Rocky Mountain foothills to keep an eye on their children and pets after a series of mountain lion sightings. Donna Kendrick says she and a neighbor saw a mountain lion recently in their backyards in west Loveland. Kendrick told the Loveland Reporter-Herald on Friday the big cat saw her and “vanished like a ninja.” Kendrick called the Colorado Parks and Wildlife department, where spokesman Jason Clay says wildlife managers are aware of the sighting. Clay says Loveland-area residents reported mountain lions twice previously this year. People have reported mountain lions six times this year in nearby Masonville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State Insurance Commissioner Andrew N. Mais is urging homeowners to review their insurance policies before the upcoming tropical storm season. Peak hurricane season in Connecticut begins in mid-August and runs through late October. Mais says policyholders should discuss with an agent or insurance company if they have appropriate and adequate coverage. Although homeowners, condo and renters insurance cover many types of storm damage, he notes that damage from flooding is excluded. Separate policies can be purchased from the federal National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer. He says now is the time to buy those policies, considering there’s a 30-day waiting period before the policy takes effect.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:From 2006 through 2012, nearly 300million painkillers were shipped into Delaware according to a Drug Enforcement Administration database published this week by The Washington Post. If those 276,177,276 pills were distributed equally, that would be 286 for every Delawarean. The data set, known as ARCOS, tracks the journey of every prescription painkiller in the United States, starting with the manufacturer that produced it all the way to the pharmacy that purchased it. In 2006, 29 million prescription painkillers landed in Delaware communities. In 2011, the year with the highest volume, that number was nearly 48 million — a 68% increase. In 2012, the most recent year of data available, the number was 41 million. More than half of the pills — nearly 150 million — arrived in New Castle County. Sussex County had the highest per capita rate in the state at 361 pills per person. Kent County saw the greatest increase in pills delivered between 2006 and 2012, going from 4.5 million to 7.1 million respectively — a 57% increase.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Developer Adrian Washington, CEO and founder of Neighborhood Development Company, has apologized for padlocking Little Jewels Daycare and Nooks Barbershop citing environmental concerns last week, WUSA-TV reports. To make amends, Washington has offered the barbershop and daycare spots in a new building paying the same rent. “We did the right thing (where) there was a clear health emergency, but we did it in the wrong way. We didn’t communicate well, we came in suddenly and people rightly felt disrespected,” Washington says. He adds it served as a valuable learning lesson even for a developer who has been in the business for more than two decades.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Augustine: An alligator that eluded capture for days in a Chicago lagoon is settling in its new home. The St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park said in a Facebook post Friday that it welcomed the reptile known as Chance the Snapper with a banner, pizza and the band Chicago’s greatest hits. The park that now houses Chance recommended the Florida trapper Chicago officials flew in to capture the gator. The 4-foot, 18-pound American alligator became an instant sensation from the day he was spotted in the Humboldt Park lagoon and photos popped up online. Investigators don’t know why the animal was in the lagoon, but experts say it wouldn’t have survived the winter. Park director John Brueggen says Chance will stay alone for 90 days to make sure he is illness-free, and then join other gators.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia Power intends to rely more on solar power than in past years to deliver energy to homes and businesses. It will also close a coal-fired power plant in the northwest part of the state. WABE-FM reports that it’s part of the company’s long-range energy plan, which was recently approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Under the plan, Georgia Power will close its coal-fired power plant near Rome. Also part of the plan: the company says it will add more wood burning to its energy mix. Georgia Power has proposed an increase in rates by about 7 %. Hearings on that matter are scheduled to begin later this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuki: The governing authority for Maui’s water utility plans to study the feasibility of buying and maintaining an irrigation system that diverts stream water from east Maui and delivers it other parts of the island. The county Board of Water Supply voted Thursday to establish a subcommittee to study the issue, The Maui News reported. Alexander & Baldwin developed the East Maui Irrigation system a century ago to supply water to its sugar cane fields in central Maui. The company last year sold the cane fields to Mahi Pono, which is growing a variety of crops on the land. The system, which is today owned by A&B and Mahi Pono, has also supplied 35,000 residents in Upcountry with water. These water users have been in limbo after a bill that would have authorized the state to extend A&B’s water permits failed at the state Legislature in May. A&B’s diversion permit expires in December. The bill’s failure raises questions about the permit’s renewal and the delivery of water to end users after that date.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: In February, Idaho Fish and Game drastically cut the number of moose tags because of population declines across the state. In 2019-2020, there will be only 634 moose tags available each year, a 22% decrease from 2017-2018, which also saw an 8% reduction compared to 2015-2016. The Panhandle region of Idaho saw a 45% reduction in moose tags, the largest in the state, and the elimination of antlerless tags. Wildlife biologists do not have clear answers for the drop in moose population, but the likely suspect is a combination of habitat loss, ticks and predators. Idaho Fish and Game does not know exact moose population numbers but estimates there are 10,000 to 12,000 in the state. To estimate populations, Idaho Fish and Game relies on harvest information.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Thousands of people have visited the governor’s mansion since it reopened last year after renovations that cost $15 million. The State Journal-Register reports that the governor’s office says more than 29,000 people have toured the mansion. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner spearheaded the renovations because maintenance had been neglected. Recent former governors rarely used the mansion before the renovations. But Rauner lived there and now Gov. J.B. Pritzker has moved in. The mansion offers exhibits highlighting the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago and life during the Civil War. An “Art of Illinois” project also showcases 80 pieces of fine and decorative art. The mansion has hosted free weekly concerts this summer. The mansion is open daily from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. for guided tours.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: The Navy is planning to commission its new USS Indianapolis combat vessel at a northwestern Indiana port this fall. The ceremony marking the ship’s entry into the Navy’s active fleet is set for Oct. 26 at Burns Harbor along Lake Michigan. It is the fourth military vessel carrying the Indianapolis name. The second USS Indianapolis was sunk by a Japanese submarine in July 1945 while returning from a Pacific island where it delivered key components for the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Only 317 of its nearly 1,200 crewmen survived the sinking and days in shark-infested waters. The ship was built at a Marinette, Wisconsin, shipyard and will be based near Jacksonville, Florida. It is a Freedom-class littoral ship designed to be highly maneuverable for missions such as mine-clearing and anti-submarine warfare.\n\nIowa\n\nCoralville: Iowa State University is dropping claims of wrongdoing against a former employee and paying her $225,000 to resolve a legal dispute over its popular outdoor sculptures made from Legos. As part of the settlement, Iowa State has also taken several steps to restore the reputation of Teresa McLaughlin. Iowa State President Wendy Wintersteen has written her a glowing letter of recommendation calling her an honest, innovative employee. The school also will dedicate a bench for McLaughlin in Reiman Gardens, the campus landmark that McLaughlin spent most of her career building as its director. Those steps will resolve a contentious three-year legal dispute that derailed Nature Connects, the traveling Lego art program conceived by McLaughlin. McLaughlin had accused the university of failing to pay her commissions. The university accused her of working to market competing exhibits.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: A local zoo says two of four red panda cubs born last week have died. Officials with the Lee Richardson Zoo say one of the male cubs died of injuries “of an unknown origin” shortly after he was born. Another female cub died while being cared for by her mother. The cubs were among quadruplets born last Wednesday to Ember, a 9-year-old red panda. The zoo says only 1% of red panda litters are quadruplets. Ember and the cubs are expected to be on public display in late September or early October. Until then, footage of mom and cubs will be available on the zoo’s social media accounts.\n\nKentucky\n\nNewport:The city’s plans to install a SkyWheel at the Newport on the Levee can move forward, the city announced Monday. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has approved the permit for construction of SkyWheel, the observation wheel planned for the riverfront, according to the city. Construction on the 230-foot tall SkyWheel will start as soon as possible. It will feature 30 climate-controlled gondolas and will be built at Newport on the Levee, right next to the Newport Aquarium, by Koch Development of St. Louis.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Mississippi River is finally low enough again to let the Army Corps of Engineers begin closing a huge spillway after a record-breaking run diverting water into Lake Ponchartrain. The corps says Monday in a news release that about 10 of the 168 open bays in the Bonnet Carré spillway would be closed by day’s end. Spokesman Matt Roe says full closing is expected to take about a week, with daily checks to make sure the river remains low enough to avoid stressing the city’s levees. The spillway was created to limit the river’s rush past New Orleans, keeping it below 1.25 million cubic feet per second – an amount that would fill the Empire State Building in 30 seconds. The spillway was opened May 10 for the second time this year.\n\nMaine\n\nStonington: A group of Maine lobstermen that has the backing of the state’s Congressional delegation is pushing back at a plan to protect endangered whales with new fishing regulations. A federal team has called for the removal of half the vertical trap lines from the Gulf of Maine to reduce risk to North Atlantic right whales. Lobstermen from the Maine coast gathered with three members of the delegation and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in Stonington on Sunday to make the case the new rules would put an unfair burden on a key state industry. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, who attended the rally, says right whales need help, but the government’s “one-size-fits-all risk reduction” approach might not be the best way. The whales number about 400 and have experienced high mortality recently.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Several hundred people gathered outside Johns Hopkins Hospital to protest the hospital’s practice of suing patients over unpaid medical bills. The Baltimore Sun reports the Saturday demonstration also promoted the efforts of Hopkins nurses to join the National Nurses United union. The Sun reported in May that Hopkins has filed thousands of lawsuits since 2009 against patients with outstanding bills. It reported a large portion of those lawsuits targeted residents of low-income areas. Hopkins emailed a statement to employees Saturday saying it supports its nurses right to unionize, but the union released false information about Hopkins’ debt collection practices. Spokeswoman Kim Hoppe says the court is only called on when patients stop responding and all points of contact are exhausted. She says patients can apply for medical or financial hardship.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers are weighing a ban on the practice of declawing cats. Supporters of the measure say declawing is cruel and painful. They say cats rely on their paws and claws to groom themselves and to help protect and defend their bodies. The practice involves amputating a cat’s toes to the first knuckle. A bill that would prohibit declawing is scheduled for a public hearing at the Statehouse on Monday before the Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure. Lawmakers in New York last month voted to approve a bill banning the declawing of cats. The bill was sent to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Declawing a cat is already illegal in much of Europe and in several Canadian provinces, as well as in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver.\n\nMichigan\n\nArcadia:An exclusive golf course no longer encourages players to hit balls into Lake Michigan after a diver found hundreds in the water. A description on the Arcadia Bluffs website of the 12th hole overlooking the lake had said, “Go ahead and do it, everyone does,” in reference to hitting a ball into the water before striking a tee shot. The Detroit Free Press says Arcadia Bluffs removed that reference last week after inquiries from the newspaper. Golf course president William Shriver says he doesn’t want to encourage the practice. Experts say golf balls are made of plastic and rubber and aren’t good for the Great Lakes. A beverage cart employee says she was fired for discouraging players from hitting balls into the lake. Arcadia Bluffs declined to comment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:About 400 butterflies filled the sky on Sunday afternoon to celebrate lost loved ones at the eighth annual butterfly release event organized by Quiet Oaks Hospice. More than a thousand people were in attendance to listen to music, send off a butterfly, sip on root beer floats and enjoy a summer breeze by the river. In previous years, the event organizer would read off the names of those who were being celebrated during the butterfly release. But this year, attendees were invited to speak the name of the person they were celebrating and take a moment of silence to reflect.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: A group petitioning to legalize medical marijuana in the state says it needs about 28,700 more signatures to put the initiative on the November 2020 ballot. Jamie Grantham is communications director for Medical Marijuana 2020. She says organizers have gathered more than 86,000 signatures. That’s about two-thirds of what’s needed. The Commercial Dispatch reports Grantham spoke to a civic club Tuesday in Columbus. She says the state Department of Health would regulate every facet of the program, including overseeing treatment centers where products would be sold. She says only Mississippi licensed physicians could prescribe marijuana products to people with “debilitating medical conditions.” State Public Safety Commissioner Marshall Fisher says he opposes easing marijuana laws because of concerns the drug could be abused. He was a longtime narcotics agent.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Lobbyist spending in Missouri has dropped by 94% since voters approved a $5 cap on lawmaker gifts last year. A KCUR analysis of state data concludes that lobbyists spent less than $17,000 on lawmakers in this year’s legislative session compared with last year’s spending of about $300,000. Peverill Squire, a University of Missouri political science professor, says financial gifts don’t buy votes, but they can buy lawmakers’ effort and time. Squire says most of the spending is on larger events that all lawmakers can attend, which adheres to the cap rule. Kelly Gillespie, a lobbyist who heads Missouri Biotech Association, says the new rules limit educational possibilities. Gillespie’s group funded a program last year to teach lawmakers about drug discovery and health care affordability. That is no longer an option.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Glacier National Park officials are teed off over a report that tourists were hitting golf balls off Going-to-the-Sun Road during a traffic delay. NBC Montana posted a video Thursday taken by a tourist during a road construction delay that shows two men teeing off with golf clubs on the side of the steep mountain road. On Friday, Glacier spokeswoman Lauren Alley told the Missoulian the incident is under investigation. She says throwing or hurling things over Going-to-the-Sun Road has the potential to hurt or kill people or wildlife. She says anyone who spots such activity should try to record the person’s license plate number or remember their face if it can be done safely. Alley says law enforcement calls at Glacier are up 40% over last year.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two king penguin chicks that hatched in March are now on display at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium. The first chick hatched March 14 and now weighs 26 pounds. The second hatched March 16 and weighs 32 pounds. Their genders are not yet known. The chicks will remain in a segregated “chick pen” in the Antarctic penguin habitat until they molt their nonwaterproof down feathers. It also allows the chicks to get acclimated to the habitat and the other penguins. The chicks were raised by adult males – not typical for this species. Generally, an adult female shares that responsibility. The Zoo’s Aquarium Birds staff only intervened during select feeding times to get the chicks used to accepting food by hand. The zoo has 24 king penguins: 13 males, nine females and the chicks.\n\nNevada\n\nFernley: The second-largest commercial land sale in state history is expected to bring thousands of new jobs to a northern Nevada industrial park covering nearly 7 square miles about 30 miles east of Reno. A California-based real estate firm, Mark IV Capital, outlined details of the $45 million purchase along Interstate 80. The Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada estimates more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created as a result of the potential development at what will be called the Victory Logistics District. Mark IV Capital cited location and infrastructure as reasons for its decision to acquire the property. In addition to easy railway access, it sits at a crossroad near I-80 and U.S. Highways 50 and 395.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLoudon: The state Department of Transportation will be implementing a traffic control plan for fans attending Sunday’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Foxwoods Resort Casino 301 Race in Loudon. The race starts at 3 p.m., with maximum traffic congestion occurring in the late afternoon and early evening. There will be ramp closures and other changes affecting Route 106, Interstate 93 and Interstate 393. In some areas, extra temporary lanes will be created.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Passengers traveling between New Jersey and New York have experienced rail delays of five hours or more about 17 times per year in recent years. That’s the conclusion of a review conducted on behalf of New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. The study’s findings were released Monday by the overseers of a multibillion-dollar project to build a second Hudson River rail tunnel and a new rail bridge over New Jersey’s Hackensack River. The study covered 2014 through 2018 and says the delays cost commuters almost 2,000 hours in extra transit time. They were mostly caused by mechanical problems and an aging infrastructure. The $13.7 billion tunnel project has been stalled by disputes between New York and New Jersey and the federal government over how the cost will be divided up.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: In what’s expected to be a long, contentious process, a few dozen people gathered recently for the first public meeting hosted by Public Service Co. of New Mexico on the planned shutdown of its coal-fired power plant. The utility says it wants feedback on four proposed options for replacing the power that will be lost when the San Juan Generating Station closes in 2022. The proposals are outlined in a filing made earlier this month with the Public Regulation Commission. Regulators will review the options in public hearings over the next nine to 15 months. The Albuquerque Journal reports PNM also will hold meetings in August with organizations that want to test potential changes in the different scenarios using modeling tools to determine costs and feasibility.\n\nNew York\n\nAlexandria Bay: The St. Lawrence River has been named the best bass fishery in the nation. It’s a first for the river, which borders Canada to the north and was ranked in the top 10 twice in the past four years by Bassmaster Magazine. The average weight of the entire 149-team field during a June tournament was 20.3 pounds, topped by the winning team from Sam Houston State University, which averaged 24.4 pounds a day. The Big Bass Award for that event was a 6-pound, 7-ouncer. Bassmaster Magazine editor James Hall says in some years there was internal debate over No. 1, but not this year. New York’s Lake Erie out of Buffalo was 10th.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Housing prices in Buncombe County have never been higher, outpacing even that of prices in Asheville city limits for the first time in nearly six years, data compiled by area real estate agencies show. The county's median sale price for the year's second quarter was $319,500, up more than 10% from the same time in 2018 and its highest figure on record, according to Mosiac Community Lifestyle Realty. The rise is being driven by more homes selling for more than $300,000 and fewer selling below $300,000 compared to the same time in 2018, Mosaic said. Buncombe had 732 home sales during the quarter, a roughly 8% boost from the previous year's totals. The same time period yielded 453 home sales in Asheville, also a record number for a quarter, says Mosiac.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Game and Fish Department says its workers have just completed one of the largest fish stocking efforts in the history of the agency. Crews have stocked 140 lakes across the state with more than 11 million walleye fingerlings from the Garrison Dam National Fish Hatchery. Fisheries production leader Jerry Wiegel says the Garrison Dam hatchery had to step up this year because of fish production that couldn’t be used at the Valley City National Fish Hatchery. Its source of water is Lake Ashtabula, where zebra mussels were recently discovered. Walleye already produced at Valley City here used only to stock Lake Ashtabula. Some were also sent to other states for use in lakes where zebra mussels exist.\n\nOhio\n\nRossford: Amazon says it will open two new distribution centers in Ohio. The company announced Monday that the two sites in Akron and near Toledo will bring a combined 2,500 full-time jobs. The new facility in Akron will be built on the site of a former shopping mall. The one in Rossford near Toledo is going up at the intersection of Interstate 75 and the Ohio Turnpike. Each of the two distribution centers will cover more than 700,000 square feet. Both centers will employ workers to pack and ship small items. Amazon has five other distribution centers in the state. They employ a total of roughly 8,500 workers.\n\nOklahoma\n\nChickasha: One of the last remaining Democrats from a rural district in the state Legislature says he won’t seek re-election in 2020. Rep. David Perryman announced Monday that he won’t seek a fifth-consecutive term for House District 56. The southwest Oklahoma district includes the towns of Anadarko, Chickasha, Fort Cobb, Minco and Pocasset. A minority floor leader, Perryman says it’s a “frustrating time” to be a Democrat from rural Oklahoma and that he’s disappointed with the lack of bipartisanship in the Legislature. Republicans have a 77-24 advantage over Democrats in the House. Perryman says that when he completes his term in November 2020, he plans to resume his full-time law practice in Chickasha.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The state’s iconic Douglas firs are declining as the state’s summers have grown hotter and drier. Drought also is killing grand fir and might be contributing to declines in Western red cedar and bigleaf maple. Oregon has experienced drought each summer since 2012, peaking in 2015. Although rainfall and snowpack have been close to average the past two years, temperatures in many areas still were above normal. Climate change is expected to increase drought in Oregon. Oregon Department of Forestry scientists conduct statewide aerial and ground tree surveys across 30 million acres each year, recording the number of dead and dying trees from all causes, including drought, storms, disease and insect damage. In 2018, about 680,000 acres contained damaged or dead trees attributed to all causes. That’s fewer than at the peak of the drought but still higher than historic levels.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkinsburg: Pogopalooza, known as the World Championships of Pogo, bounced into the city last weekend. Extreme pogo stick athletes from around the world came to town to show off their huge tricks and flips to compete for world titles in such categories as High Jump and Best Trick. The events on Saturday and Sunday weren’t just for the grown-ups. Pogo users under the age of 15 entered a “bounce off” competition and those who bounced the longest got a free pogo stick. Visitors tried their hand at pogo-sticking in a free jump area that had pogo sticks of all sizes. In addition to the main competitions, the pogo athletes attempted to break three Guinness World Records over the weekend.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: A Titanic survivor’s walking stick with an electric light she used to signal for help from a lifeboat has sold for $62,500 at an auction of maritime items. Guernsey’s auction house held the auction in Newport on Friday and Saturday. Guernsey’s President Arlan Ettinger says the top bid on Ella White’s cane was $50,000, plus the surcharge added by the auction house. The preauction estimate had been $300,000 to $500,000. The walking stick was consigned to Guernsey’s by the Williams family in Milford, Connecticut. Ettinger says some family members contested the sale. The issue was resolved before the auction, but the dispute might have made potential bidders nervous. Ettinger says the winning bidder said he was there on behalf of a friend in the United Kingdom.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOrangeburg: A family owned plant in Orangeburg County that makes machines for textile mills is closing after nearly 50 years. Mayer Industries Inc. CEO George Fischer says the company is consolidating its work making braiding machines at plants in Germany. Fischer told The Times and Democrat of Orangeburg that its 59 employees were told of the closing two years ago and the company has been working to help anyone find a new job. Fischer says Mayer Industries did a similar consolidation of its knitting machine business nearly 20 years ago. Mayer Industries built the Orangeburg plant in 1970 and created a course at the nearby technical college to teach workers metric measurements they would need to make machines for the European market.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A National Guard unit has been welcomed home after a nearly year-long deployment to the Middle East. A ceremony was held Sunday afternoon for the 26 members of the 935th Aviation Support Battalion at the Army Aviation Support Facility in Rapid City. KOTA-TV says community members showed their appreciation with prayer and applause. Gov. Krisit Noem told the guard members their dedication did not go unnoticed because of their exemplary work. The Rapid City-based unit provided aviation maintenance and repair support for the Army.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office says six corrections officer have resigned after an internal investigation into accusations of inappropriate conduct. The Commercial Appeal reports that the identities of the deputies were not provided. A social media post from the sheriff’s office says the investigations focused on inappropriate relationships with inmates at the Shelby County Jail. The deputies were suspended with pay in mid-June while an investigation was conducted. One of the deputies resigned in June after being charged with a personal conduct violation and consorting with persons of bad or criminal reputation, which are administrative charges. Sheriff’s Office Captain Anthony Buckner says in a video release that the investigation was halted because the deputies left the department and the office’s General Investigation Bureau did not find sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges.\n\nTexas\n\nDeer Park: The cleanup of millions of gallons of waste and polluted water is far from over four months after a large fire burned for days at a Houston-area petrochemical storage site. The Houston Chronicle reports that Intercontinental Terminals Company, the facility’s owner, must abide by a 31-page management plan that underscores how waste is sampled and identified, stored and discarded. The March 17 fire at the company’s Deer Park site, located southeast of Houston, triggered air quality warnings. More than 21 million gallons of potentially hazardous waste and contaminated water have since been collected from the tank farm and Houston Ship Channel. The Harris County District Attorney’s Office filed water pollution charges in April against Intercontinental Terminals Company, alleging the fire caused chemicals to flow into a nearby waterway.\n\nUtah\n\nAlpine: Police in northern Utah were surprised to learn the suspect in a reported burglary was a wild turkey. Dave Ventrano with Lone Peak police says they received a call on Saturday from a resident who heard a window break in the house next door. The family that lives there was out of town. Officers searched the house and found a dead turkey lying in a pile of broken glass underneath a window on the first floor of the home. Ventrano said the turkey died after flying through the window. He said there are a lot of wild turkeys in Alpine. Police gave the turkey carcass to a resident who owns a local barbecue restaurant.\n\nVermont\n\nStowe:The once-endangered common loon is making a comeback in Vermont, but not without the help of humans across the state who build islands for the birds. Eric Hanson, a loon biologist with the state Center for Ecostudies has been leading the group's efforts to manage loon populations in the state. On July 15, Hanson, volunteers from the conservation group Friends of Waterbury Reservoir and Park Ranger Chad Ummel met at the northern part of Waterbury Reservoir to grab some canoes and kayaks and paddled out to build a nesting raft for the two loons that call the artificial lake home. The raft the crew put together on the reservoir was made from a base of cedar logs. Hanson sawed notches on the logs so they fit together like Lincoln Logs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond:The state Department of Health has issued a warning to residents that there has been an increase in respiratory illnesses across the state. The health department received increased reports of respiratory, or breathing, illnesses across the Commonwealth greater than observed in previous summers. Most of the reports have occurred among older adults and those with chronic medical conditions in assisted living and long-term care facilities, the VDH said. The reports involve different regions of the state and different diseases, including pertussis (whooping cough), influenza, haemophilus influenzae infection, Legionnaire’s disease and pneumonia caused by rhinovirus or human metapneumovirus.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton:The Kitsap Pride in the Park 2019 event emphasized unity: among law enforcement, churches, elected officials and community members. The Bremerton Police Department, City Council members and Mayor Greg Wheeler were among the hundreds of community members in attendance at Evergreen Park on Saturday. The Police Department took to the main stage following Wheeler's address to announce its “Safe Place” program. The program, operated by Officer and LGBTQ liaison Mitchell Chapman, will allow the department to offer a safe haven at the station for victims of hate crimes while police resolve the issue. Chapman says he will be working closely with local businesses and social services to train them on the protocols to serve as safe spaces.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nVivian: Crews have begun clearing the scene of a train derailment, where up to 20 cars went off the rails, some of which had carried hazardous materials at one point. No one was injured. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports Kimball Fire Chief Jimmy Gianato says the hazardous material train cars were empty during the Saturday crash, but will still be continually monitored becauese of possibility of a leak. After the Norfolk Southern train cars derailed near Vivian, some toppled onto their side. Others fell into the neighboring creek. The newspaper reports one was labeled “Carbon Dioxide Refrigerated Liquid.” Crews with Norfolk Southern, Emergency Railroad Services and Cranemasters worked to clear the scene Sunday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAppleton:In the midst of a sweltering heatwave that scorched more than half of the U.S., there was some good news for Appleton residents: It apparently has been worse. A Seattle news station reported Friday that Appleton is home to the hottest \"feels like\" day in U.S. history, when the temperature hit a high point of 101 degrees with a dew point of 90 degrees on July 13, 1995. That combination produced a heat index — or made it feel like — 148 degrees that day, KOMO News reported. Friday wasn't quite that hot — Appleton saw a high temperature of 90 degrees and dew points ranged from the low-to-mid 70s, says Scott Berschback, a meteorologist out of the National Weather Service office in Green Bay. Berschback couldn't confirm Friday's peak heat index, nor could he confirm the purported record.\n\nWyoming\n\nRock Springs: Two residents are trying to end the use of a gas chamber for euthanasia at an animal shelter. The Humane Society of the U.S. says Wyoming is one of just four states where shelters still use gas chambers rather than lethal injection to euthanize animals; the others are Missouri, Ohio and Utah. Animal welfare advocates say gas chambers are cruel because death often doesn’t happen quickly. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports Madhu Anderson and Eve Waggoner have been protesting the use of gas at the Rock Springs animal shelter. Anderson says lethal injection is more humane and not difficult to implement. Rock Springs Police Chief Dwane Pacheco says the shelter only euthanizes feral cats and aggressive dogs and has one of Wyoming’s few free spay-and-neuter programs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/01/mister-rogers-civics-education-fishy-promotion-news-around-states/49308903/", "title": "Mister Rogers, civics education: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican-led committees in the Legislature advanced new congressional, legislative and school board districts Friday as lawmakers try to get new maps in place in time for the 2022 election. The House State Government Committee voted along party lines to approve new lines for the state’s seven congressional districts and 105 districts in the Alabama House of Representatives. Democrats, who voted against the plans, raised concerns that the proposed lines don’t reflect a state that has grown more diverse and would pack their supporters into a single congressional district. And while the plan passed with GOP support, several Republicans expressed concern that their legislative districts had been sacrificed for other party priorities. The maps, along with Alabama Senate and Board of Education districts, are in line for votes Monday by the full Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate. Democrats have argued that Alabama, whose population is about 26% Black, should have a second congressional district with a significant African American or minority population. The seven-member delegation has for decades included a single African American, elected from the only district with a majority-Black population. The district is now represented by Rep. Terri Sewell, who’s also the only Democrat in Alabama’s congressional delegation.\n\nAlaska\n\nSoldotna: The city wants to create a new “main street” running parallel to the Kenai River. City officials on Thursday applied for a $360,000 federal grant that they hope would fund planning for the project that is also expected to boost capital investment in the area, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The planning project is estimated to take about 18 months and would help with efforts to design a new “main street” adjacent to the river. It would address about 85 acres of land running along the Kenai River, from Soldotna Creek Park to the Sterling Highway bridge. Many of the riverfront properties are privately owned, and development would require private and public partnerships. Currently, there is no road or trail that offers developed public access or views of the Kenai River between the highway bridge and state-owned land. Three dead-end roads stop short of the river. “Based on the number of no trespassing signs in many places the river today is more of an attractive nuisance than an asset,” city documents say. City officials informed City Council members that previous discussions with landowners indicated their support for collecting more information to determine the project’s feasibility. If approved, funding for the grant would come from the American Rescue Plan. Soldotna has already spent $90,000 of its own funds on the project.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly five years after Joe Arpaio was voted out as sheriff of Maricopa County, taxpayers are covering one of the last major bills from the thousands of lawsuits the lawman’s headline-grabbing tactics inspired – and the overall legal tab has hit $100 million. County officials agreed last month to pay $3.1 million to cover the county’s portion of a settlement with a restaurant owner who alleged Arpaio defamed him and violated his rights when raiding his businesses. The payout boosted the cost stemming from Arpaio’s six terms to $100 million for attorney fees, settlements and other costs the county has paid from lawsuits over things such as jail deaths, failed investigations of the sheriff’s political enemies and immigration raids of businesses. That doesn’t include the separate $178 million and counting taxpayers have shelled out in a 2007 racial profiling case stemming from Arpaio’s signature traffic patrols targeting immigrants, though about 75% of that spending has occurred during his successor’s watch as he works to comply with court-ordered overhauls of the sheriff’s office. Advocates for immigrants have long warned Arpaio should be viewed as a cautionary tale for the long-term financial obligations communities take on when they let local police officers handle immigration enforcement.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A special election will be called to fill the term of Republican state Sen. Lance Eads, who resigned from his position Thursday to take a job in the private sector. Eads, who won reelection last year to a four-year term, represented a district in northwest Arkansas that includes Springdale and parts of eastern Washington County. He said he was resigning to take a consultant job with the Little Rock-based lobbying firm Capitol Consulting Firm. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports Eads will remain a resident of northwest Arkansas. Eads served two years in the House of Representatives before first winning election to the Senate in 2016. Gov. Asa Hutchinson must call a special election to fill the vacancy in the Senate. “Sen. Lance Eads has served his community well,” Hutchinson said Thursday. “He has been a good partner in the successes we have achieved in Arkansas from economic development to lowering taxes.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nNewport Beach: Four weeks after an oil spill washed blobs of crude onto Southern California’s coast, surfers have returned to the waves, and people play in the surf. But fishermen still can’t drop lines in the same waters. California has prohibited fishing in an area that ranges about 6 to 12 miles off the shores of Orange County since an undersea pipeline leaked at least about 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. State environmental health experts are conducting studies to determine whether shellfish and fish are safe for human consumption – a process expected to take weeks or longer. Scott Breneman, owner of West Caught Fish, said he still fishes for tuna and black cod well beyond the prohibited area. He said he’s been able to keep selling his catch to restaurants, but customers aren’t buying like they usually do at a popular Newport Beach fish market because of concerns about the state fishing ban. “People assume that local fish is contaminated, and we’re fishing like 90 miles off the beach here, a long ways away,” Breneman said, adding that he’s heading out fishing about half as much as usual. “I don’t want to take the resource when I can’t sell it.” Commercial fishermen and charter operators have been hit especially hard. Some have joined lawsuits against pipeline owner Amplify Energy of Houston and worry about lingering effects on tourism.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A former long-shot Idaho gubernatorial candidate on trial in the 1984 killing of a 12-year-old Colorado girl has testified that he did not know the girl or her family before she vanished and denied being involved in her disappearance. At the time, Steve Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle Matthew and her family in Greeley, about 50 miles north of Denver. The girl’s remains were found by oil and gas workers in 2019. She had been fatally shot. Pankey was charged with Jonelle’s murder last year after showing extreme interest in the case for many years and allegedly sharing details with investigators that had not been made public. Pankey said in court that he pretended to know information about the case out of bitterness for police and for his former church and former employer, both of which he wanted investigated, KCNC-TV reports. Most of his testimony Thursday to questions by his lawyer was rambling and included comments about his hatred of racist police officers. District Attorney Michael J. Rourke pressed him about his views about police, which Pankey said came from seeing officers humiliate and hurt Hispanic people while he was working for an ambulance service in California. Pankey said he refused to put a splint on a sheriff’s deputy who broke his leg, letting the deputy ride to the hospital in pain. He said the deputy screamed for eight or 12 minutes. “I sat there and watched,” Pankey said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: The state’s attorney general is investigating the closure of Quinnipiac University’s Great Irish Hunger Museum, which shut its doors permanently in August after nine years dedicated to study of what’s commonly known as the Irish potato famine. Attorney General William Tong’s spokesperson Elizabeth Benton confirmed the probe to the New Haven Register on Thursday, saying in a statement that “we have an open and ongoing inquiry into this matter.” Tong took up the investigation after a lawyer representing an organization dedicated to saving the Hamden museum sent a letter to his office, raising concerns about the prospect of museum artifacts being sold off. The group, the Committee to Save the Great Irish Hunger Museum, was planning a “salute to the museum” Saturday with Irish dancing, food and treats. A Quinnipiac spokesperson told the Register that the university is “not selling any” items and that it’s committed to finding a way to ensure the collection “remains publicly accessible, advances the museum’s original mission, and preserves the story of the Great Hunger.” Morgan said the university is cooperating with the attorney general’s inquiry. Morgan said Quinnipiac decided to close the museum because of funding shortfalls and a lack of interest from visitors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Lawmakers in the state House don’t have enough votes to petition the governor to remove indicted Auditor Kathy McGuiness, who refuses to step down or take a leave of absence while she faces an indictment for alleged abuse of office. Instead, they appear to prefer a proposal from the Senate to ask the courts for advice on how to execute the constitutional law that sanctions the removal process, which has not been touched in living memory. Meanwhile, a judge ruled Thursday that McGuiness must be provided a public defender or pay for her own private attorney to fight criminal corruption charges. The ruling settles a conflict between McGuiness and Delaware prosecutors, who argued that McGuiness, by virtue of her public office, was entitled to a public defender, not her choice of a more expensive, private attorney to be funded by the public. McGuiness faces two felony charges and multiple public corruption misdemeanors, all of which carry the potential of more than 10 years in prison. Specifically, she is accused of giving her daughter a do-little job in the auditor’s office, rigging state contracts to avoid regulatory scrutiny and intimidating those who questioned her behavior, according to an indictment filed against her last month.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ahead of the holiday season, the National Park Service planted a new National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse in President’s Park on Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The new tree is a 27-foot white fir from Middleburg, Pennsylvania, the park service said in a release. Donated by Hill View Christmas Tree Farm, it will be the first white fir to serve as the National Christmas Tree. Since 1973, the National Christmas Tree has been a living tree that people can view year-round at President’s Park. The National Park Service said a white fir was selected because it is more resilient to needle cast disease, a fungal issue that affects spruce trees and causes their needles to fall off. The previous tree, a Colorado blue spruce planted in October 2019, succumbed to needle cast disease, according to the National Park Service. NPS officials say transporting and taking care of such a large tree can be challenging and requires careful planning and mild weather conditions. Late October is an ideal time for planting, but there is still a chance for transplant shock, experts say. NPS horticulturists will keep an eye on the tree’s health and ensure its transition is as easy as possible. The tree will be lit up during the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, details of which have not been announced yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nWinter Park: A little rain didn’t stop it from being a beautiful day at Rollins College as school officials unveiled a sculpture honoring alumnus and beloved children’s TV host Mister Rogers. Rollins President Grant Cornwell and others held umbrellas during Thursday’s private ceremony as they pulled back a drape on the bronze rendering of Rogers in his iconic sweater and tennis shoes, a work entitled “A Beautiful Day for a Neighbor.” “This inspirational sculpture will be a permanent reminder of the ideals and values modeled by Mister Rogers as he set out to make the world a better place,” Cornwell said during the ceremony at the private liberal arts college in Winter Park, just northeast of Orlando. Years before the world came to know him as Mister Rogers, Fred McFeely Rogers transferred to Rollins College in 1948 and graduated in 1951, according to the school. He majored in music composition and served as president of his fraternity and chairman of the Inter-Faith and Race Relations Committee. He also met his future wife at the school. He received an honorary degree from the school in 1974. The 360-degree sculpture designed by Paul Day, a British artist known for his public monuments, depicts Rogers surrounded by children, hand puppets from his show, lyrics from the theme song for “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the show’s Neighborhood Trolley. The sculpture will be part of the school’s Mister Rogers Walking Tour.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Former residents of a Black neighborhood that was destroyed more than 50 years ago and replaced with university dorms and parking lots are demanding the university recognize their loss. The city used eminent domain to force Black families out of the Linnentown neighborhood in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal plan. It sold the land to the state Board of Regents, and dorms and parking lots for the University of Georgia went up after the homes were razed. Now, a group of former residents and descendants wants the university to apologize for the land seizure and create a memorial to Linnentown, which was home to dozens of Black families, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. One member of the Linnentown Project group, Bobby Crook, told the newspaper the university needs to pay compensation, though he acknowledged that may not happen. The average condemnation award for homes in the neighborhood was $5,750, according to a resolution approved by Athens-Clarke County commissioners in February. The land – roughly 20 acres – and the improvements on it are worth tens of millions of dollars today. The county resolution did not mince words, accusing the city and the University System of Georgia of “an act of institutionalized white racism and terrorism resulting in intergenerational Black poverty, dissolution of family units, and trauma through the forcible removal and displacement of Black families, and the accumulation of the majority of their wealth and political power within the University System of Georgia and the City of Athens.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKihei: A new high school on Maui won’t be welcoming students as planned next fall because the state Department of Education didn’t build a pedestrian bridge to the campus. The state Land Use Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to stick to its earlier decision to require the state to build the bridge over Piilani Highway to Kihei High School, Hawaii News Now reports. That means the school won’t be able to open for the fall 2022 semester. The busy highway separates the school from neighborhoods where many students live. Currently, public school students in Kihei are enrolled at Maui High School, which is overcrowded. There are some charter school options in the area. The commission in 2013 said either a pedestrian overpass or an underpass would be required for safety. “It’s a shame that this high school, which is almost built, will not be open on time,” said Dan Giovanni, the commission’s vice chairperson. “To me, the fault for that is the DOE.” A department spokesperson said the department is assessing its next steps. Department officials said the state Department of Transportation advised them that a pedestrian bridge was not yet necessary because only a few students were scheduled to start school in August 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers will gather this month to consider legislation banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates by the federal government and private employers, according to top lawmakers in the House and Senate. Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro Tem Chuck Winder said the chambers will likely return for several days Nov. 15. The House never officially adjourned, and it can reconvene if called by Bedke. Winder said he would recommend senators return as well. Bedke said he expects about a dozen pieces of legislation to be introduced, including some to prevent employers from requiring workers get vaccinated. He said lawmakers getting between the employee-employer relationship wasn’t his preference, but some lawmakers supported the idea. “The objective is to get all of the various ideas out into the public domain so that everyone can take a look at them, to start the process,” Bedke said. “I don’t know how many of them, if any of them, will get critical legislative mass, in our bicameral system, but we’ll see.” Both said lawmakers will look at legislation that would allow the state to initiate legal action over federal vaccine mandates on private employers. The legislation would include $2 million for a potential legal battle.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A conservation group has reached an agreement with a northern Illinois airport that temporarily halts work on a project that would destroy an 8,000-year-old tract of remnant prairie. The Bell Bowl Prairie, located on the Rockford Airport’s property, is targeted for demolition as part of a $50 million expansion of the airfield’s cargo operations. The prairie’s longtime stewards, the Natural Land Institute, sued the Greater Rockford Airport Authority last week, seeking injunctive relief to temporarily halt bulldozers from destroying the 25-acre prairie. The nonprofit conservation group announced Thursday that a deal putting that work on hold through March 1, 2022, had been reached through U.S. District Court with the Greater Rockford Airport Authority, its board of commissioners and executive director, WTTW-TV reports. Construction of an access road that would cut through the prairie’s highest-quality habitat had been slated to resume Monday. The temporary hold buys more time for the Natural Land Institute to convince the Airport Authority to explore alternative design concepts that protect the prairie and the endangered rusty patched bumblebee, the institute said in a statement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal appeals court has cleared the way for state officials to start enforcing a law requiring reports from doctors if they treat women for complications arising from abortions, even though the court said the law could be struck down in the future. Action by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last week followed a 2-1 ruling by a court panel in August upholding the law, which had been blocked by a judge shortly after it was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2018. The law lists 25 physical or psychological conditions – including unsuccessful abortions, infections, uterine perforations, depression and deaths – that could trigger the reporting requirement for doctors or clinics. It makes failure to do so a misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Planned Parenthood challenged the law in federal court, arguing that it was vague and would leave medical professionals uncertain in determining whether they needed to report conditions such as a patient’s anxiety or minor bleeding regardless of whether they believed it stemmed from the abortion. The Chicago-based appeals court last week turned down Planned Parenthood’s request for the full court to reconsider the case, and it issued an order Thursday allowing the law to go into effect.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A school board candidate changed his name following conviction on a threat of terrorism charge last year after he said he would shoot up a high school and sexually assault students. Christian Mathew Holtz, 20, of Ankeny, is one of seven candidates running in Tuesday’s election for school board in the Ankeny Community School District. His campaign has focused on addressing bullying, protecting marginalized groups and being a younger voice for students on the board, among other issues. Holtz has been running his campaign and participating in candidate forums as he remains on probation for the threat of terrorism charge, a felony, according to court records. In March 2020, Holtz – then known as Isaac Quinton Holtz – was charged in Dallas County District Court after police accused him of sending an email to more than 750 Waukee High School students and staff saying he planned to come to the school with a gun, shoot all the students, and go into the locker room to sexually assault and murder girls. According to a criminal complaint, police said he admitted to sending the email. Holtz entered an Alford plea, a type of guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges that the evidence would probably persuade a judge or jury otherwise. He was sentenced to three years of probation. Reached by phone Friday, Holtz would not directly confirm or deny he is the same person involved in that case. “It’s not me because I’m not Issac anymore,” Holtz said. “I’m Christian.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of people opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates rallied Saturday at the Statehouse and pushed state lawmakers to quickly counter them, while an international labor union disavowed a local leader’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust that killed millions of Jews. The rally kicked off ahead of a rare weekend legislative committee hearing on mandates from President Joe Biden that affect as many as 100 million Americans. The hearing gave dozens of mandate opponents a chance to vent their frustration and anger with the White House and with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s handling of the pandemic. Several critics of the mandates suggested Saturday that they violate international human rights standards enacted in the wake of atrocities during World War II. Bryan Luedeke, a Wichita-area aircraft worker, called them “reminiscent of Nazi Germany.” His comments followed Friday’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust by Cornell Beard, president of the Wichita district of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A committee member, Rep. Brenda Landwehr, R-Wichita, appeared to agree with the analogy.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that jails cannot force inmates to pay for their confinement if their criminal charges are dropped or if they are found not guilty. Ruling for a Winchester man who was billed more than $4,000 for his incarceration, even though a felony charge against him was dismissed, the court said inmates can only be charged if the payment is ordered by their sentencing judge. And because people who are acquitted or have charges dropped are never sentenced, they can’t be required to pay, the court said in a 12-page opinion Thursday. Greg Belzley, the attorney for David Allen Jones, said the ruling is a “huge” victory for the presumption of innocence. Belzley said he will ask that the ruling be applied to all inmates who are exonerated or have charges dropped, which could have serious financial implications for the commonwealth’s jails. “Jails are crumbling, but the way that gets addressed is through taxes, not by going after our poorest citizens,” he said. “We are delighted with the ruling.” The attorney for the Clark County Detention Center, Jeff Mando, had argued in a brief that the presumption of innocence does not apply to jail fees because they are not “punitive.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state Senate has created a special committee to dig into complaints about the use of excessive force by the State Police, after troopers were documented in a series of beatings of Black men that have drawn attention from federal investigators. Senate President Page Cortez said he set up the seven-member advisory panel in response to requests from senators concerned about troopers’ behavior. He sent a letter Thursday officially naming lawmakers to the committee. Two senators from Baton Rouge will lead the work: Republican Sen. Franklin Foil will be chairman, and Democratic Sen. Cleo Fields will work as vice chairman. Foil intends to hold the panel’s first meeting in December, he said, and expects the committee to hear from the State Police and the public with an eye toward developing recommendations for tightened laws regarding use of force that legislators can consider. The review will focus more on overall policies, rather than specific allegations of improper force, he said. The Senate Select Committee on State Police Oversight will “go over what kind of oversight the State Police has when there are reports of excessive force that may have been used inappropriately and what mechanisms they have as far as safeguards,” said Foil, a lawyer and Navy officer who has worked as a military judge.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Health care centers are facing a staffing crunch, but COVID-19 vaccination mandates are not the cause, according to the chief of the largest health network in the state. MaineHealth CEO Andrew Mueller said the organization has a staff vacancy rate of about 10% and described that level of staffing loss as “really, really difficult” for the organization, especially at a time when hospitals are full. However, he said, the shortage can be attributed to an aging workforce and workers leaving the industry because of the stress of working during the pandemic. The deadline to begin enforcing the vaccine requirement for health care workers across the state arrived Friday. Mueller had said that he expected to lose 1.5% to 2% of staff systemwide but that those losses would be offset by fewer COVID-19-related absences. “We actually think we’re going to have more capability and less shortages in a real way by ensuring our workforce is vaccinated,” he said last week. Meanwhile, Northern Light Health announced that unvaccinated workers would no longer be working at its 10 hospitals as of Saturday. In Lewiston, Central Maine Medical Center was already in compliance, with unvaccinated staff members not allowed to work.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state lawmaker who is a plastic surgeon has been fined $15,000 and reprimanded for twice participating in legislative meetings via videoconference from an operating room during surgery. Del. Terri Hill signed a consent order last month agreeing to the disciplinary actions from the Maryland Board of Physicians, which found the Democratic lawmaker guilty of “unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.” The board noted that Hill participated in one voting session of a House committee while appearing in a video feed wearing “a surgical gown, facemask, and surgical cap.” In Maryland’s legislative session this year, legislative committee meetings were held by videoconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The public was able to livestream the meetings and hearings. “She was positioned under the surgical lights, focused downward, and would occasionally shift, reach for surgical instruments, or adjust the lights,” the board’s report said, noting the surgeon and other operating room staff “occasionally moved surgical equipment and blood-stained towels so that they were briefly visible on the video feed.” In a statement Friday night, Hill said she has worked hard to fulfill her professional obligations to both her patients and her constituents during the pandemic – a balance that has been challenging at times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Students will have greater access to school meals under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The new law requires schools or districts to implement universal free breakfast and lunch for all students if a majority of students in the school meet low-income criteria. The law also bars school employees or volunteers from publicly identifying a student when payment for a meal hasn’t been received. Denying a student a meal as a form of punishment for bad behavior or disposing of an already served meal because of a student’s unresolved meal debt is also banned. Schools will also be prevented from denying a student or their sibling the chance to participate in non-fee-based extracurricular activities because of meal debt; prohibiting a student from receiving grades, transcripts, report cards or graduating as a result of meal debt; or requiring a parent or guardian to pay additional fees or interest costs above the amount owed for meals. “This legislation is another way we can ensure all children in the commonwealth have access to healthy meals when they are in school,” Baker said after signing the bill last Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: As promised, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-sponsored legislation that would toughen in-person voter identification rules and require people to include additional information such as their driver’s license number on absentee ballot applications. The governor said the bills would disproportionately hurt minority voters who are more likely not to have a photo ID on Election Day than white voters. They also would prohibit the secretary of state and clerks from mailing absentee ballot applications unless voters request them and ban private donations to help administer elections. “Voting restrictions that produce such a racially disparate impact must never become law in this state,” Whitmer wrote to lawmakers. A GOP-affiliated ballot committee, Secure MI Vote, is circulating petitions that would enable the Republican-controlled Legislature to enact a similar initiative next year regardless of Whitmer’s opposition. In Michigan, voters who go to a polling place without a photo ID can cast a regular ballot if they sign an affidavit. More than 11,400 did so in the 2020 presidential election. Under the legislation, they would get a provisional ballot and have to verify their identity with the local clerk within six days of an election for their vote to count. The governor said the change would disenfranchise voters, and there is no evidence that affidavit ballots are related to voter fraud.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Sales at municipal liquor stores in the state soared in 2020 for a record-breaking year. Sales at Minnesota’s 213 “munis” jumped 10% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report released last week by State Auditor Julie Blaha. In recent years, a typical sales increase has been in the range of 1% to 3%. With many bars and restaurants either closed or operating at reduced capacity during parts of the year, people did more of their drinking at home, according to liquor store managers and employees. And the lifestyle shifts prompted by the pandemic played a major role. The Star Tribune reports the bars and liquor stores transferred more than $21 million back to their local governments in 2020, helping supplement traditional tax revenue. According to the International Wines and Spirits Record, Americans consumed 2% more alcohol last year than in 2019. It was the biggest year-over-year increase since 2002.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Retired NFL player Brett Favre and Mississippi Auditor Shad White feuded Friday over the auditor saying Favre failed to make speeches after being paid by welfare money. The Twitter spat happened days after Favre repaid $600,000 to the state – the last portion of the $1.1 million that the auditor said Favre received from a nonprofit organization that used money intended to help needy people in one of the poorest states in the U.S. The auditor said Wednesday that Favre still owes $228,000 in interest, and the state attorney general could sue if that is not paid by mid-November. “Of course the money was returned because I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,” Favre wrote Friday. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback, who lives in Mississippi, wrote that he made commercials for which he was paid by a nonprofit group. White tweeted that Favre’s contract required speeches and a radio ad. “The CPA for Favre Enterprises confirmed this was your contract,” White replied to Favre. “You did not give the speeches. You have acknowledged this in statements to my agents.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Professional sports teams are trying to put a proposal to legalize sports betting in the state on the ballot, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. A Jefferson City lawyer filed nine ballot proposals on the issue last week on behalf of the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Blues, St. Louis City soccer club and Kansas City Royals. Money from taxing sports betting would be split between schools and roads under the proposals. Efforts to pass a law allowing sports betting have failed for years in Missouri’s GOP-led Legislature, so the teams are hoping to take the issue directly before voters. Republican Sen. Denny Hoskins has proposed several bills to legalize sports betting. But he warned that legalizing sports betting through the Missouri Constitution will mean lawmakers can’t easily address any potential issues with the program once it’s enacted. In Missouri, proposals need a certain number of voter signatures to be put on the ballot. Backers haven’t started collecting signatures yet.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental regulators ignored the law when they permitted an expansion of a massive strip mine that is the sole source of coal for a large power plant despite concerns about water pollution, a judge ruled. State District Judge Katherine Bidegaray ordered the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to revisit its 2015 permit to expand the 25,752-acre Rosebud Mine, owned by Colorado-based Westmoreland mining. The judge’s Thursday order came after environmental groups sued over damage to a nearby creek from wastewater that flows out of the mine. Rosebud, in the Powder River Basin along the Montana-Wyoming border, fuels the Colstrip Power Plant that burns about 8 million tons of coal annually. For years, nearby East Fork Armells Creek has received salty water from the mine and contaminants from coal ash ponds at the power plant, The Billings Gazette reports. The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act forbids the state from issuing mine permits unless it can be proven there won’t be damage to the balance of water outside the permit area. But Bidegaray said the state was doing the opposite – allowing harmful salt levels in Armells to increase. It’s unclear what the ruling means for mining operations, a Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Christian student group has sued the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, alleging that the school discriminated against the group’s views when it denied a funding request to bring a Christian philosopher to campus as a guest speaker. The federal lawsuit by the group Ratio Christi alleges that the university failed to distribute money to student groups in a fair, viewpoint-neutral manner, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The lawsuit says Ratio Christi requested $1,500 in January from the university’s Fund Allocation Committee, which it was entitled to do as a recognized student organization. The group wanted to bring in philosopher and former university professor Robert Audi, who is currently a philosophy professor at the University of Notre Dame. The students were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization that supports conservative Christian causes. The lawsuit alleges that the university’s program council told Ratio Christi it would need to invite another person from a different ideological perspective to the same event to receive funding. The school allegedly said it could not promote speakers of an ideological nature with its student organization funding, according to the lawsuit. In a statement Friday, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts called on university Chancellor Ronnie Green to intervene and define policies that encourage all viewpoints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hundreds of hotel, casino and restaurant workers in matching red shirts rallied Thursday on the Las Vegas Strip as the Culinary Union made a second monthly call to return people to jobs idled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Culinary Union said more than one-third of its 60,000 members haven’t been rehired, despite a recovery by casinos and hotels from closures imposed in March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “If companies are going to charge you the full rate, you want to make sure you get full service,” union President Ted Pappageorge said, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The message echoed calls made Sept. 24, when the Culinary Union organized a march of thousands of members on the Strip. Casinos statewide have ridden a tourism surge to set monthly winnings records, room rates have rebounded, and tourism officials report the number of visitors is approaching pre-pandemic levels. Nevada’s unemployment rate in September was 7.5%, down slightly from 7.7% in August. That’s more than twice the record low of 3.6% in February 2020 but far below the record peak of more than 30% set in April 2020 – a month after businesses and casinos were shuttered. The union says many idled employees have exhausted public unemployment benefits.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed its Homebound Vaccination program for COVID-19 shots. Appointments are being scheduled to provide first, second and booster doses of the vaccines to people who are unable to leave their homes, have difficulty doing so, or have been advised by a medical provider that their health could worsen by leaving their home. The state Department of Health and Human Services has contracted with On-Site Medical Services in Newport to conduct the program.

If customers showed that they cast their ballot Friday or Saturday – presumably by displaying an “I voted” sticker – they were eligible for a free fried fish sandwich at TJ’s Southern Gourmet. A state statute on bribery says offering or receiving “money or other valuable consideration” to induce someone to vote or not vote “shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree.” The fried whiting sandwiches being offered by TJ’s – and the giveaway’s promotion by Teaneck school board member Victoria Fisher, who is up for reelection – is cause for concern for some people. Teaneck Councilman Keith Kaplan said Friday that he sent information about the fried fish sandwiches to Bergen County Superintendent of Elections Debra Francica and that he would send it to the state attorney general if needed. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the offer for free whiting, which typically sells for $8 and is described by reviewers as “fried to perfection.” Francica, however, said she had “checked with the AG’s office, and that’s legal.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Researchers say they have more evidence that Chaco Canyon was more than just an ancient gathering spot for Indigenous ceremonies and rituals. The researchers from the University of Cincinnati analyzed pollen content and the chemical composition of soils to help document environmental impacts of the early residents who called the area home. Their findings, published last week in the journal PLOS ONE, focus on changes resulting from tree harvesting that sustained daily life at Chaco. The researchers reported a gradual degradation of the surrounding woodlands beginning around 600 B.C., much earlier than previously thought. While some of the mysteries surrounding Chaco, now a national park and UNESCO World Heritage site, are still debated in academic circles, there’s agreement that the massive stone buildings, ceremonial structures called kivas and other features that dot the landscape offered a religious or ritualistic experience for the ancestors of today’s Native American pueblos. Many of Chaco’s structures are aligned with celestial events, such as the summer solstice. David Lentz, a biology professor and lead author of the study, said many researchers have the idea that Chaco was too arid to sustain day-to-day living and that the infrastructure built over many centuries at Chaco was used only as a periodic ceremonial center and storage facility. Lentz said that explanation is too simplistic, and his team turned up evidence to support human management of the area’s environment to support daily life.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Nine in 10 municipal workers received COVID-19 vaccinations as a Monday deadline loomed under a city mandate, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. City officials have been making contingency plans to deal with an expected staffing shortfall Monday. De Blasio tweeted Saturday night that 91% of city workers had received the vaccine, which represented a jump from about 83% as of Friday night. Under a city mandate, those who haven’t received at least one dose of a vaccine against the disease will be put on unpaid leave starting Monday, raising the possibility of shortages of police, fire and EMS workers. New York has more than 300,000 employees. The police department, which employs about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, reported an 84% vaccination rate as of Sunday morning, while roughly 2 in 10 of the fire department’s roughly 17,000 employees remained unvaccinated as of Friday night. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro denied reports that some firehouses had been closed due to shortages. “Irresponsible bogus sick leave by some of our members is creating a danger for New Yorkers and their fellow firefighters,” he said in a statement Sunday. And six Brooklyn-based firefighters angry with the mandate were pulled from duty and suspended after driving a fire truck to a state senator’s office and threatening his staff over the requirement, with which the lawmaker wasn’t involved.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Bus drivers for the state’s largest school system called in sick Friday to protest working conditions, prompting administrators to urge parents to arrange their own transportation and warn of similar problems this week. Officials with the Wake County Public School System said 400 of the 600 buses operated by the system were running, news outlets report. Bus drivers have said concerns about being overworked and underpaid haven’t been addressed. Many parents said their children walked to school, or they were driven to school when their buses didn’t show up. The Wake County system has 160,000 students, and up to half of them ride the bus in a normal year. Wake County Superintendent Cathy Moore and school board chairman Keith Sutton wrote in a message to staff members: “The pay and salary structure for the work we do is not adequate. Our bus drivers shone a harsh light on this reality.” Moore and Sutton also said many drivers have to run as many as six routes a day without receiving extra compensation. They said most school staffers are in the same situation. The system also told parents that bus service for Monday is uncertain and asked families to plan for that possibility.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday called a fall special session to deal with a limited agenda that includes legislative redistricting and the approval of a spending plan for federal coronavirus relief aid. The Nov. 8 special session approved by the governor through an executive order has no time restriction and may last indefinitely, though legislative leaders said they hoped it would only last five days. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner and GOP House Majority Leader Chet Pollert have been meeting with Burgum in recent weeks to discuss the possibility of a special session. They joined the governor at the Capitol in announcing the special session Friday. The North Dakota Constitution limits the Legislature to 80 days of meetings every two years, and last spring’s regular session used 76 days. That means if the GOP-led Legislature had called itself back into session, lawmakers would have had to shoehorn the redistricting job, pandemic spending and other proposed legislation into just four days. Each of those subjects would take a minimum of three legislative days to be approved by both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP leaders said all of the Legislature’s pending business could have been accomplished during a reconvened session, though they preferred the special session.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two Republican appointees to the Ohio State Board of Education resigned Friday, about two weeks after they opposed its decision to rescind an anti-racism resolution passed last summer. Board President Laura Kohler, of New Albany, told reporters that GOP Gov. Mike DeWine requested her resignation and that Republicans in the state Senate who didn’t like the resolution would’ve had enough votes to remove her if she didn’t step down. The resolution, passed by the board last summer after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, condemned racism and included an acknowledgment that “the path to equity begins with a deep understanding of the history of inequalities and inhumanity.” It talked about training board members and Department of Education employees to identify their own biases and recommended that districts reexamine areas such as curriculum and discipline strategies. In their resignation letters to DeWine, Kohler and board member Eric Poklar, of Worthington, didn’t specifically mention the anti-racism resolution or related controversy. Kohler told the governor she felt resigning was how she could “best support you and your work at this time.” Poklar wrote that his “time on the board has ended” and that he was ready to pass responsibilities to the next person.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: While medical experts say it’s unclear why a condemned inmate began convulsing and vomiting after the first of three drugs used to execute him was administered Thursday, all agree the dosage was massive compared with what’s standard in surgeries, with one doctor calling it “insane.” The state’s prisons agency is now likely to face new litigation, which may focus on the state’s description of the execution of John Marion Grant for the 1998 slaying of a prison cafeteria worker as “in accordance with” protocols. Grant, 60, convulsed and vomited after the sedative midazolam was administered. That drug was followed by two more: vecuronium bromide, a paralytic, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Thursday’s lethal injection ended a six-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma that was brought on by concerns over its execution methods, including prior use of midazolam. Oklahoma’s protocols call for administering 500 milligrams of the sedative. Arkansas and Ohio are among other states that use that dose of midazolam in executions. “It’s just an insane dose, and there’s probably no data on what that could cause,” said Jonathan Groner, an Ohio State University medical school surgery professor and lethal injection expert. He added that sedation does not increase as the dosage goes up. “There’s a reason these drugs are given by anesthesiologists and not prison guards,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s “badly damaged” reputation – marked by months of destructive protests, a homelessness crisis and record year of homicides – is hurting its standing, according to its main tourism promoter. Travel Portland, the tourism promotion group partly funded by taxes, presented data to the City Council and mayor last week showing the city has declined to its “lowest level” of being a likely destination for delegates to attend conferences. Just 64% of surveyed tourists said they would visit Portland again. “There’s an old old saying, ‘It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and you can ruin it in an instant.’ That’s true of cities, as it is people,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said in response to the Travel Portland data. “And we’re just going to have to commit to that long-term process of improving the safety and the livability and the economic prosperity of the city.” The liberal city had long been known nationally for its ambrosial food scene, craft breweries and nature-loving hipsters. But last year, it became the epicenter of racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. For months, a small downtown area was consumed by protests that often turned violent, with clashes between demonstrators and federal agents, plumes of tear gas, fireworks exploding in the streets and rubber bullets flying through the air. While Portland’s violent protests have largely eased, there are still outbreaks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Members of the city’s largest transit workers union reached a tentative contract agreement early Friday, averting a possible strike that threatened to bring elevated trains, buses and trolleys to a halt and leave thousands of children and educators without a way to get to school this week. The existing contract between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the 5,000-member Transport Workers Union Local 234 was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The tentative agreement announced by the union includes a two-year contract with a pay increase, a pandemic payment and parental leave for workers. “Our members are essential workers who move Philadelphia and who have risked their lives putting their own families at risk during this pandemic,” Willie Brown, Local 234 president, said in a statement praising Friday’s agreement. Members are scheduled to vote to ratify the contract next Friday. The union had voted Oct. 24 to authorize a worker walkout if an agreement couldn’t be reached. The union represents bus, trolley and elevated train operators, as well as mechanics and other staff. Union leadership had asked for a four-year contract with annual wage increases and a pandemic payment to compensate SEPTA workers who had served on the front lines of the pandemic, keeping public transportation moving for other essential workers. Nearly 800 members contracted COVID-19, and 11 TWU members died from COVID-19 or related complications, union leaders said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Students from the state are asking a federal appeals court to affirm that all public school students have a constitutional right to a civics education, saying that they aren’t taught how to meaningfully participate in a democratic and civil society and that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was a symptom of such ignorance. Students nationwide need to know how to participate in the political process, effectively exercise their constitutional rights, and learn skills like media literacy to distinguish accurate from false information, their lawyers argue. The plaintiffs have asked the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Boston, to reverse a lower court’s dismissal of the case, declare there’s a constitutional right to an adequate civics education, and send the case back to district court. Such a judicial declaration is urgently needed, their brief to the court argues, in light of the events of Jan. 6 that were carried out by “a mob motivated by a fundamental misunderstanding of the congressional role in counting electoral votes.” Oral arguments will be heard Monday. The defendants include Rhode Island’s governor, education commissioner, and other education authorities.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJenkinsville: An area near the town has been hit with multiple minor earthquakes over the past week, including the latest one Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey initially registered the early Sunday morning earthquake in Fairfield County at 2.2 magnitude but later edged up the intensity to 2.3, multiple news outlets report. It’s the sixth small earthquake in the area over a week, with three quakes recorded Thursday alone. The State newspaper reports the South Carolina Emergency Management Division is studying the seismic activity. Earthquakes that register less than 2.5 usually are too small to be felt.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Workers at a pork processing plant that was overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic say the company is no longer working in good faith. A spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers local union said the workers are “fed up” with injustices at their facilities after being on the front lines of the pandemic at the Smithfield plant for nearly two years. Local union president B.J. Motley said in a Friday release that the company is speeding up lines of production, verbally abusing employees, and neglecting social distancing and sanitary measures. “In consequence, we are seeing a record number of quits, injuries, grievances and overall unhappiness,” Motley said. “Our workers are tired, and their families are being affected by the heartlessness of the situation.” Jim Monroe, vice president of corporate affair for Smithfield, said in a statement that it’s the first time they have heard those concerns and that they disagree with the “portrayal of conditions” at the facility. The complaints come four months after the union agreed to a contract with Smithfield, which increased base pay, provided a bonus, and offered options of one to three weeks of leaves of absence and 15-minute breaks for employees working eight-hour shifts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The GOP-controlled General Assembly has signed off on a number of measures undercutting COVID-19 protections, while also begrudgingly backing off on threats to revoke businesses’ ability to enforce mask mandates. Lawmakers approved the slate of bills early Saturday while most Tennesseans were asleep, marking the second time the Legislature has recently advanced significant legislation in the middle of the night. Democratic lawmakers quickly criticized that their Republican lawmakers were willing to concede to concerns raised by influential businesses lobbyists but not those pointed out by school and health officials alarmed at other measures that advanced during the three-day special legislative session. On Friday, Gov. Bill Lee’s office confirmed Ford Motor Co. and other manufacturers had expressed concerns with several of the proposals being discussed during the special session. Lee had declined lawmakers’ requests to call a special session to address the coronavirus, forcing them to collect enough signatures to call the session without the governor. By Saturday, Lee thanked Republicans for taking up certain issues but held off from promising he would sign all of the bills into law.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Marcos: Local police officials refused to provide an escort for a Joe Biden campaign bus when it was surrounded by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on an interstate, an amended lawsuit filed over the 2020 encounter alleges. The updated lawsuit, filed Friday, included transcribed 911 audio recordings, The Texas Tribune reports. The suit alleges that law enforcement officers in San Marcos “privately laughed” and “joked about the victims and their distress” in the audio recordings. The city of San Marcos didn’t return a request for comment from the newspaper. A spokesperson previously said the city and the San Marcos Police Department would not comment because of the pending litigation. Videos shared on social media from Oct. 30, 2020, show a group of cars and pickup trucks – many adorned with large Trump flags – riding alongside the campaign bus as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin. The “Trump Train” at times boxed in the bus. At one point, one of the pickups collided with an SUV behind the bus. According to the transcriptions, a 911 dispatcher told one bus passenger to call back if the caller felt threatened. “Are you kidding me, ma’am?” the caller replied. “They’ve cut in on me multiple times. They’ve threatened my life on multiple occasions with vehicular collision.”\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: Zion National Park officials and national conservation leaders met at the Utah Outdoor Recreation Summit on Thursday to hold the first public engagement meeting for a new recreation management plan. The five-person panel discussed the East Zion Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project to develop the east side of the park in order to disperse visitors and protect the “last unprotected gateway to a national park in the continental United States.” “The regional recreational management planning process is not just a thing: It is a spirit, it is a community effort, and it needs to remain such if it’s to be successful,” said Kevin McLaws, the owner of Zion Mountain Ranch and of the land granted for the East Zion Initiative. During the summit, titled “Crafting a Community-Led Vision for Regional Recreation Management in Greater Zion,” leaders and attendees discussed “solutions to trip planning, visitor experience, dispersal, mobility, and economic opportunity” that the region faces, the summit’s website said. As Zion is the third-most-visited national park in the county, seeing over 4 million visitors per year, the park and nearby gateway communities have seen record-high visitation since last fall, putting strain on amenities, the environment, businesses, park staff and locals and causing crowding.\n\nVermont\n\nFairfax: Some school districts are using electric school buses this fall as part of a pilot project to test their effectiveness. Gov. Phil Scott and education leaders celebrated the introduction of four electric buses in Fairfax on Thursday, with more expected to arrive this month. The buses also being used by the Champlain Valley School District and the Barre Unified Union District will start using them this month. “We are beyond excited to add electric buses to our fleet,” said Justin Brown, middle school principal at Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax. “We all hope this paves the way for more ‘green’ transportation in our – and our kids’ – future.” The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately save school districts money, officials said. An emissions settlement with Volkswagen is funding most of the project. The school districts each get two buses. Bus driver Patsy Parker said the electric buses are quieter than diesel models, which she believes makes her young passengers quieter, too. The buses’ battery range has forced schools to reconsider some routes, particularly during cold weather, school officials said. “Where we would normally be able to go 120 miles a day, we’re limiting more to 60 or 70 miles a day because of the cold weather. But that’s what this pilot program is about,” Parker said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The anti-Donald Trump group The Lincoln Project took credit Friday for five people appearing with tiki torches at a campaign stop by the GOP candidate for governor – a stunt recalling white supremacists who descended on the city amid violence in 2017. Charlottesville TV station WVIR reports candidate Glenn Youngkin was inside a restaurant when the group dressed in matching hats, khakis and white button-down shirts appeared beside his campaign bus. The former private equity executive and political newcomer is in a close race against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe as Tuesday’s Election Day nears. Photos showed the group holding large tiki torches. Their appearance recalled two days of chaos in 2017, when white supremacists gathered for a “Unite the Right” rally ostensibly to protest the planned removal of a Confederate monument. The night before the planned rally, a group carrying tiki torches marched across the University of Virginia campus, clashing with a small group of anti-racist protesters. The next day, a car driven by a self-avowed white supremacist plowed into a crowd of peaceful counterprotesters, killing one and injuring dozens. McAuliffe staffers promoted a reporter’s tweet about the group’s appearance, using it to attack Youngkin and suggesting that those holding the torches were his supporters. Youngkin staffers then accused the McAuliffe campaign or Virginia Democrats of being involved, drawing disavowals from McAuliffe’s campaign.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: After more than 18 months of pandemic-driven eviction limits, Gov. Jay Inslee said he would allow the latest version of the state’s eviction moratorium to expire Sunday. The move opens the door for an influx of new eviction cases and tests key tenant protections for the first time since the pandemic upended the legal process last year. “We have to have some end to the moratorium. You can’t have an economy ultimately where just nobody pays rent,” Inslee said at a press conference last week, the Seattle Times reports. Soon after the coronavirus hit, Inslee used his emergency powers to halt most evictions. This fall, Inslee loosened the rules. He replaced the moratorium with a “bridge” proclamation that still stopped some evictions for nonpayment of rent in certain parts of the state but allowed evictions for other reasons. The expiration of that policy Sunday means landlords can seek more evictions of tenants who fell behind on rent during the pandemic, provided owners go through newly required steps such as offering the tenant a payment plan. Most evictions will still be halted in Seattle, Burien and Kenmore, where local lawmakers have passed their own eviction moratoriums to last through early 2022.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKenova: When COVID-19 vaccines first became available, Ric Griffith’s family-owned drugstore was among 250 mom-and-pop pharmacies that helped the state get off to the nation’s fastest start in vaccinating its residents. Republican Gov. Jim Justice went on national news shows to declare West Virginia – a place that regularly ranks near the bottom in many health indicators – “the diamond in the rough.” Nine months later, those days are a distant memory. Demand for the vaccine has almost dried up, the question of whether to get a shot has become a political hot button, and West Virginia’s vaccination rate has plummeted to the lowest among the states. The governor, who spent months preaching the virtues of the vaccine to reluctant West Virginians, is still doing that but also promoting a new law that would allow some exemptions to employer-imposed vaccination requirements. And shots are mostly sitting on shelves. “I’m afraid that while taking a victory lap, we discovered that there were more laps to go in the race,” Griffith, who is also a Democratic member of the state House of Delegates, said Monday of West Virginia’s descent from first to worst. Griffith said he was proud of Justice’s nonstop effort to push vaccines “and the obvious love he has for the people of West Virginia.” But Justice also ended a statewide indoor mask mandate in June and has opposed vaccination and mask requirements since.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has declined to issue a ruling on a preliminary injunction requested by Ojibwe tribes to stop the state’s 2021 wolf hunt. But Chief U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson said Friday that he had “deep misgivings” about state rules that proved inadequate in February to keep the wolf kill to the intended target. The case is part of a lawsuit filed Sept. 21 by six Wisconsin Ojibwe tribes against the Department of Natural Resources and Natural Resources Board. The tribes argue that the hunt violates their treaty rights and endangers an animal they consider sacred. The Wisconsin wolf hunting and trapping season in February resulted in a kill of 218 wolves, 99 wolves above the state-licensed quota. The shares had been split 119 for the state and 81 for the tribes. The take by state-licensed hunters and trappers effectively consumed the tribes’ quota. The tribes are represented by the California-based environmental group Earthjustice. The case took an unusual turn due to a preliminary injunction on the wolf season handed out Oct. 22 in a similar case by a Dane County judge. With the season already effectively blocked, Peterson said he wasn’t able to issue relief. But he heard arguments and testimony over seven hours Friday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State senators on Friday voted down the last special legislative session bill they had written to counter President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccinations – one that would have prohibited discrimination against business customers and others based on their vaccination status. The special session that began Tuesday in response to the federal plans will continue Monday, however, when senators plan to take up a House bill to bar employers from considering vaccination status in hiring decisions. The measure cleared the House 38-20 on Friday. The Senate will also consider a bill that would give Gov. Mark Gordon’s office $1 million to fight the Biden administration vaccine requirements for certain federal, health care and other private-sector employees and to prohibit enforcement of the requirements in Wyoming. That bill passed the House 41-14 on Friday. With no more legislation related to COVID-19 immediately left to consider, the House adjourned until Wednesday. Lawmakers worried that prohibiting discrimination based on a person’s vaccination status would have unforeseen and unintended consequences for businesses. The bill would open the way for “still more ways to sue” businesses, said Sen. Dave Kinskey, R-Sheridan, calling it “a lawyer’s field day.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}]}

Then the American League's top team went a step further by acquiring two top pitchers from the Oakland Athletics as they make a push for their first World Series title since 2009.\n\nWhat other deals could be made as the countdown to the deadline continues? USA TODAY Sports will provide updates on all the key trades.\n\nFOLLOW ON TUESDAY:Live updates on rumors, deals; will Juan Soto get traded?\n\nOPINION:Yankees are making it clear at trade deadline: World Series or bust\n\nANALYSIS:Brewers believe they can still win without All-Star closer Josh Hader\n\nBraves get Jake Odorizzi, Robbie Grossman\n\nThe Atlanta Braves stayed busy late Monday night, adding two more veteran players.\n\nThe Braves are reportedly adding veteran right-handed Jake Odorizzi in a trade with the Houston Astros and outfielder Robbie Grossman in a deal with the Detroit Tigers.\n\nThe Braves are sending veteran left-hander Will Smith to the Astros. Odorizzi, an 11-year major-league vet, was in his second season with the Astros, with whom he posted a 4-3 record and 3.75 ERA in 12 starts. Smith, meanwhile, has appeared in 41 games out of the bullpen this season, compiling a 4.38 ERA.\n\nGrossman hit a career-high 23 home runs in 2021, but has struggled to replicate that power outage this season.\n\nBrewers continue to add to bullpen\n\nHours after acquiring left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers from the San Diego Padres in the Josh Hader trade, the Milwaukee Brewers are getting right-handed reliever Matt Bush from the Texas Rangers. The Rangers will receive infielder Mark Mathias and minor league pitcher Antoine Kelly in the deal. In 40 appearances this season, Bush has a 2.95 ERA and 1.009 WHIP.\n\nCardinals get pitching help from Pirates\n\nBadly in need of starting pitching, the St. Louis Cardinals are making a deal with a division rival to help their rotation. The Cardinals are reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire left-hander Jose Quintana from the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 20 games as a starter with the NL Central's worst team, Quintana posted a 3-5 record and a 3.50 ERA, striking out 89 and walking 31.\n\nSox (both Red and White) get busy\n\nThe Boston Red Sox quickly get a catcher to replace Christian Vazquez, making a deal with the Chicago White Sox. Chicago sends catcher Reese McGuire to Boston for left-handed reliever Jake Diekman.\n\nVeteran outfielder Tommy Pham is also reportedly headed to the Boston Red Sox for a player to be named later. Once the deal is complete, this will be Pham's fifth team in the last five seasons\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks acquire third baseman Emmanuel Rivera from the Kansas City Royals for pitcher Luke Weaver.\n\nBraves lock up another young star\n\nThe Atlanta Braves signed All-Star third baseman Austin Riley to a 10-year, $212 million deal, the team announced.\n\nThe contract runs through the 2032 season with a 2033 club option for $20 million. Next season, the 25-year-old will make $15 million, $21 million in 2024 and $22 million for the rest of the contract.\n\nRiley is hitting .301 with 29 home runs and 68 RBI this season for Atlanta, who are three games back of the New York Mets in the NL East. Eleven of his home runs came in July, and he had a franchise record 26 extra base hits in the month, breaking a 60-year old record.\n\nAL contenders continue to wheel and deal\n\nThe Yankees, owners of the league’s best record, were always going to be a buyer at the trade deadline. It started with Andrew Benitendi on Thursday, continued Monday afternoon with the acquisition of right-hander Scott Effross and really ramped up a few hours later.\n\nNow they are acquiring right-handers Frankie Montas and Lou Trivino from the Oakland Athletics, according to ESPN.\n\nMontas will join the Yanks’ starting rotation, while Trivino will provide New York with another bullpen option. The A's will get left-handers Ken Waldichuk and J.P. Sears, right-hander Luis Medina and second baseman Cooper Bowman.\n\nThe Houston Astros, who begin the week two games back of the Yankees in the AL standings, traded for 1B/OF Trey Mancini from the Baltimore Orioles and right hander Jayden Murray from the Tampa Bay Rays. Mancini is hitting .268 with 10 home runs and 41 RBI in 92 games. The Orioles receive RHP Chayce McDermott from the Astros and Tampa Bay gets outfielder Jose Siri from Houston.\n\nThe reigning AL champions also acquired catcher Christian Vázquez from the Boston Red Sox. Vazquez, 31, spent eight seasons with the Red Sox and is hitting .282 with eight home runs and 42 RBI in 2022. Boston will receive prospects Enmanuel Valdez and Wilyer Abreu, the 28th- and 29th-ranked prospects in the Astros organization.\n\nBrewers deal closer Josh Hader to Padres\n\nWe finally have our first blockbuster deal of this year's trade deadline. Two National League playoff contenders have swapped closers as part of a five-player trade.\n\nThe San Diego Padres get four-time All-Star closer Josh Hader from the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for erstwhile closer Taylor Rogers, right-hander Dinelson Lamet, speedy outfielder Esteury Ruiz and pitching prospect Robert Gasser.\n\n\"The players we are receiving in this trade help ensure that the future of the Milwaukee Brewers remains bright while not compromising our desire and expectation to win today,\" said Brewers president of baseball operations David Stearns. \"This mix of present Major League talent and high-level prospects furthers our aim to get as many bites of the apple as possible and, ultimately, to bring a World Series to Milwaukee.\"\n\nHader solidifies the back of the Padres bullpen for the stretch run after Rogers was just moved out of the closer's role. Meanwhile, setup man and 2020 NL rookie of the year Devin Williams figures to slide into the closer spot in Milwaukee.\n\nHader leads the majors with 29 saves. Rogers is second with 28.\n\nNow, after acquiring Hader and re-signing ace Joe Musgrove (see below) ... will the Padres make another major move and go after Soto?\n\nRoyals acquire reliever Anthony Misiewicz\n\nThe Kansas City Royals acquired left-hander Anthony Misiewicz from the Seattle Mariners for cash considerations Monday.\n\nThe 27-year-old Misiewicz, who will be added to the Royals’ 40-man roster and optioned to Class AAA Omaha, appeared in 17 games for Seattle this season with a 4.61 ERA. He was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma on June 10, where he had a 3.65 ERA in 13 appearances.\n\nMisiewicz made his big league debut in 2020 and led Seattle in appearances in each of his first two seasons, including a career-best 66 last season, when his 19 holds ranked eighth in the American League.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nRays pick up a bullpen arm from Dodgers\n\nNot every trade can be a headline-grabber. The Tampa Bay Rays are masters at adding on the margins and they may be looking to do just that with the acquisition of lefty reliever Garrett Cleavinger from the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nCleavinger, 28, posted a 2.79 ERA in 29 innings at Class AAA Oklahoma City this season, but gave up five earned runs in 4 1/3 innings with the Dodgers. He also previously appeared in the majors in 2021 with L.A. and 2020 with Philadelphia.\n\nMinor league outfielder German Tapia goes to the Dodgers in exchange. To clear roster space for Cleavinger, the Rays released right-hander Luke Bard.\n\nWhat the Juan Soto sweepstakes should look like\n\nWith barely a day remaining to determine Juan Soto’s fate – move to a contender at Major League Baseball’s trade deadline, or draw walks in baseball purgatory for two more months – the field for his services seems to narrow.\n\nIt can be argued that the opposite should be happening.\n\nWith two full seasons and this upcoming playoff drive available to clubs aiming to acquire the Washington Nationals slugger, it’s the usual suspects, fitting a specific profile, in play for Soto. Bigger-spending, bigger-market clubs with flush farm systems are indeed the publicly-known players, with the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals certainly among the finalists.\n\nYet we can spot many more clubs that should strongly consider trading for Soto, even if many lack the prospect goods to acquire this 23-year-old hitting savant.\n\nHere’s a look at what we think good, healthy competition for this generation’s Ted Williams might look like.\n\n-- Gabe Lacques\n\nPadres re-sign Joe Musgrove\n\nBefore the San Diego Padres made the move to acquire Josh Hader, they made a major financial commitment to one of their own players.\n\nRight-hander Joe Musgrove has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract extension with the team.\n\nThe deal makes perfect sense. Musgrove is a native of San Diego and has been the team's best pitcher this season with an 8-4 record and 2.65 ERA in 16 starts. Last season, Musgrove pitched the first and (so far) only no-hitter in Padres history.\n\nYankees bolster bullpen, add Scott Effross from Cubs\n\nWith All-Star closer Clay Holmes not quite the infallible weapon he was before the All-Star break, the New York Yankees added bullpen depth by acquiring right-handed reliever Scott Effross from the Chicago Cubs for 24-year-old pitching prospect Hayden Wesneski.\n\nEffross, 28, has a 2.66 ERA in 47 appearances (with one save) for the Cubs, and was seen as a possible closer candidate if they traded David Robertson.\n\nInstead, the side-arming Effross is traded first as the deadline enters its home stretch.\n\nNationals make a trade! Just not that one.\n\nIt wasn't a Juan Soto blockbuster that has the MLB world on edge, but the Washington Nationals did open Monday's trading with a minor deal.\n\nThe Nats sent utility infielder Ehire Adrianza to the Atlanta Braves for minor league outfielder Trey Harris. Atlanta opened up a roster spot earlier by designating Robinson Cano for assignment.\n\nAdrianza was a nice contributor to the Braves' 2021 title run when he hit .247 with a .728 OPS. However, he struggled with the Nationals this year, hitting just .179 with no home runs.\n\nHarris, 26, was Atlanta's minor league hitter of the year in 2019. He was hitting .233/.333/.317 in 59 games this season for Class AA Mississippi.\n\nUnder-the-radar trade candidates\n\nFrom Nightengale's Notebook, USA TODAY Sports' subscriber-only MLB feature:\n\nOutfielder Trey Mancini, Orioles: The Orioles shouldn’t trade him. He means too much to the organization and this is a team that has stunned everyone by hovering around .500. Yet, baseball is a cold-hearted business.\n\nStarting pitcher Noah Syndergaard, Angels: He no longer blows away hitters with his fastball. He’s not considered an ace or even a No. 2 pitcher. But, oh, has he learned to pitch with his off-speed stuff. He’d be a nice No. 3 starter for any contender.\n\nStarting pitcher Jose Urquidy, Astros: The Astros are so deep that they don’t really need him. He has a career 3.66 ERA, is eligible for arbitration for the first time this winter, and has postseason experience, too. He is being offered in package deals for a slugger.\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nJacob deGrom will make 2022 debut on deadline day\n\nJacob deGrom is set to return to the mound for the Mets on Tuesday against the Nationals after more than a year away from the major league mound.\n\n\"It’s been a long time. This has been a pretty slow process of coming back,\" deGrom said. \"I’m excited to be out there. The nerves haven’t really set in yet. I’m sure Tuesday I’ll be pretty nervous. I have a feeling it’s going to feel like my debut.\"\n\nThe two-time Cy Young winner has not pitched in a regular-season game since July 7, 2021, after forearm tightness evolved into a ulnar collateral ligament sprain that kept him out for the remainder of the 2021 season.\n\n\"You want to be out there playing,\" deGrom said. \"Every day you’re able to put this uniform, I’m thankful for. It’s been a while since I’ve been able to get out there and compete. I’m ready. It’s exciting. I’m ready to help these guys.\"\n\n– Andrew Tredinnick, NorthJersey.com\n\nBrandon Drury's breakout year makes him a top trade target\n\nCincinnati Reds slugger Brandon Drury carries a lot of value as a right-handed power bat who can play anywhere in the infield and in the corner outfield spots.\n\nHe’s one of nine MLB players with at least 20 homers and 20 doubles, joining a list of sluggers that includes Paul Goldschmidt, Austin Riley, José Ramírez and Vladimir Guerrero.\n\n“It’s definitely a little bit different because it could be a whole new clubhouse in a matter of a day,” said Drury, who has been traded three times in his career. “It’s definitely on my mind a little bit, but at the end of the day, whether I’m here or somewhere else, I get to keep playing baseball. That’s all I can control.”\n\n– Bobby Nightengale, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nRelief market loses potential trade chip\n\nOne current closer who definitely will not be traded at the deadline is Daniel Bard of the Colorado Rockies. Bard, who has a 3-3 record with 21 saves and a 1.91 ERA in 37 games this season, signed a two-year extension on Saturday that will keep him in Colorado through the 2024 season.\n\nAmong the closers who could possibly be dealt before Tuesday's deadline are: the Orioles' Jorge Lopez, the Tigers' Gregory Soto, the Marlins' Tanner Scott, the Pirates' David Bednar and the Cubs' David Robertson.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/07/17/mlb-first-half-superlatives-mvp-cy-young-awards-best-worst-signings/10078029002/", "title": "MLB first half superlatives: MVP, Cy Young awards, best/worst ...", "text": "LOS ANGELES – Come on, you didn’t know the Baltimore Orioles would actually be the one of the best teams in baseball for the past month and in contention for a playoff berth?\n\nYou didn’t realize that the New York Yankees and Houston Astros would have their divisions sewn up by the All-Star break?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/08/02/mlb-trade-deadline-winners-and-losers-padres-yankees-cubs/10218179002/", "title": "MLB trade deadline winners and losers: Padres make a super-team ...", "text": "The San Diego Padres got sensational 23-year-old Juan Soto to boost their World Series hopes, while the runaway Los Angeles Dodgers countered by taking on the Yankees' Joey Gallo.\n\nThe New York Yankees got a frontline starter in Frankie Montas, two relievers and outfielder Andrew Benintendi.

There was an energy building around the team in the middle of the week, and it carried through Friday’s trade deadline.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Reds traded for three relief pitchers: Luis Cessa, Justin Wilson and Mychal Givens. Even though Cincinnati didn’t make another move before Friday’s 4 p.m. deadline, Castellanos stressed that he felt “very, very good” about the moves the Reds had made.\n\nMore:Series Wrap: Why the playoff math is still tough for the Cincinnati Reds\n\n“This sends such a good message to everybody,” Castellanos said. “To the fan base, to the players. We really see that and we appreciate the front office and ownership for that.”\n\nAt the trade deadline, the Reds were seven games behind the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central and five games behind the San Diego Padres in the Wild Card race. According to Baseball Reference, the Reds have a 15.5% chance to make the playoffs.\n\nOn top of that, the Brewers traded for All-Star infielder Eduardo Escobar this week, and the Padres added All-Star infielder Adam Frazier as well as a reliever in Daniel Hudson who has a 2.20 ERA.\n\nMore:‘He’s a ballplayer’: Kyle Farmer finally receives his shot at shortstop\n\nEven after those moves, the Reds have a few reasons to be optimistic. The biggest reason is how much they improved their bullpen.\n\n“It’s cool, we have an outstanding team here and it’s definitely very exciting,” Reds left fielder Jesse Winker said. “Getting to meet all the new guys, they all seem like outstanding guys. I’m happy that they’re here.”\n\nAccording to Reds GM Nick Krall, the Reds were clearly positioned as buyers at the trade deadline. Krall said he was making calls to improve the team throughout Friday.\n\n“We knew we had to add some bullpen help, we did it,” Krall said. “Then everything else was trying to be as opportunistic as possible. We didn't, obviously, find the opportunity (on Friday). So I was excited with the players that we ended up with. With keeping our best prospects, I'm excited to work and see where this team can go.”\n\nMore:Luis Cessa, Justin Wilson excited about opportunities in Cincinnati Reds bullpen\n\nEven though the Reds are five games out of a playoff spot, they have a softer schedule in front of them as well as several key players on the verge of returning from the injured list. On Friday, the Reds activated relief pitcher Michael Lorenzen several weeks earlier than they expected to after Lorenzen injured his hamstring on July 17.\n\nAlso on Friday, Nick Senzel (knee) and Mike Moustakas (heel) began their rehab assignments in Triple-A.\n\n“I'm excited to see where we play up the last two months,” Krall said. “I think this team is a solid team. I think we've got a chance to make a run at this.”\n\nMore:Reds notes: What it means for Reds reliever Mychal Givens to join a playoff race\n\nThe Reds didn’t trade any of their top prospects to chase a 2021 postseason run. Krall said there were teams that wanted more of the Reds farm system than Cincinnati’s front office was willing to give up or wanted players off the Reds 26-man roster that he wasn’t comfortable trading.\n\n“I think that we've got a really good clubhouse, really good chemistry and culture,” Krall said. “You want to see that keep going and we're excited to have the guys we have.”\n\nDespite the Reds not making a trade on Friday, Cincinnati still had a more aggressive trade deadline week than the team usually has. Even though the Reds added only three middle relievers, they addressed their biggest weakness.\n\nAccording to Baseball Reference, there have been seven games this season where the Reds have had a 75% or greater chance to win with the bullpen in the game and then went on to lose. The Reds are seven games behind the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central standings.\n\nWith a better bullpen, the Reds will have fewer of those games.\n\nCastellanos’ progress was another reason for the Reds’ confidence. Recently, he has taken a significant step in his recovery from a small fracture in his wrist.\n\nMore:Joey Votto homers again to set franchise record as Cincinnati Reds take series from Cubs\n\nAs he spoke on the field on Friday, he no longer had a cast on his hand. During pregame warmups, Castellanos played catch on the field.\n\nWhen Castellanos returns, he anticipates being in the hunt for a playoff berth.\n\n“This is what we want,” Castellanos said. “We want a challenge. It’s not going to be as fun if it’s easy.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2019/08/04/detroit-tigers-trade-deadline-al-avila-rebuild/1915714001/", "title": "MLB front offices expose Detroit Tigers' trade deadline mistakes", "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas — After a few days of reflection, some phone calls and many more text messages around the league, there's a meme to describe the Detroit Tigers’ early returns at the trade deadline: \"Not great, Bob.\"\n\nAt an important trade deadline, the Tigers turned two of their three biggest veteran assets into zero impact prospects. A kind description of the four-prospect collection would be \"the best they could do,\" and an unkind one would be \"underwhelming.\" As a whole, the collection received grades from the scouting community ranging from average to below-average.\n\nIn a breakneck final hour before Wednesday’s 4 p.m. trade deadline, the Tigers, now with an MLB-worst 32-74 record, settled for a low-key package in exchange for arguably the best reliever traded Wednesday, got something instead of nothing for an impact rental bat and were curiously unwilling to realistically engage on their most valuable player.\n\nThe names on those deals and non-deals: Triple-A outfielder Travis Demeritte and Double-A left-hander Joey Wentz from the Braves for closer Shane Greene, Double-A right hander Alex Lange and High-A righthander Paul Richan from the Cubs for right fielder Nicholas Castellanos and no deal at all for lefthander Matthew Boyd.\n\nTHANK YOU:Astros save MLB trade deadline from being an all-time dud\n\nMLB TRADE DEADLINE:Winners and losers start with Astros\n\nJUICED BALL FIGURED OUT?:These scientists may have solved MLB's problem\n\nTIME FOR CLOSURE:MLB players want answers to juiced ball\n\nThe end result was another missed opportunity, aided by self-inflicted issues in marketing their players, a lack of creativity in finding the best returns for those players and, of course, the shrinking trade market, which has long been the Tigers’ explanation for not bringing back significant prospect hauls.\n\nThat last reason played into general manager Al Avila's rebuttal to fans underwhelmed by the returns.\n\n“I don’t know what you mean by underwhelmed,” Avila said in a conference call. “I thought the return was pretty good considering the market for relief pitchers, and considering the competition and everything involved.”\n\nAvila isn’t wrong: The Tigers’ trade efforts have been sabotaged recently by a near-industrywide shift in philosophy in regards to the value of prospects and team-controlled contracts, precisely when they went all-in on a rebuild. Suddenly, few teams — not even most contenders — are willing to give up high-ceiling (and cost-controlled in the long term) prospects for the short-term chance of an immediate playoff run.\n\nBut look deeper, past the four newest Tigers prospects — there's potential, but not much — and questions arise about the process that seemingly keeps resulting in returns that are merely “pretty good considering the market,” and not nearly enough to kickstart the rebuild.\n\nOver the past three years, the Tigers — led by Avila, who received a contract extension on July 5 — have shown no sense or feel for timing when moving their players.\n\nTwo seasons ago, they were aggressively approached about right-hander Michael Fulmer, who was coming off an AL Rookie of the Year Award in 2016 and was the Tigers' All-Star representative in 2017. In what looms as the biggest mistake of their rebuilding process, the team rebuffed an offer for Fulmer involving two young players who are now among the best in baseball: According to multiple persons with knowledge of the talks, the Cubs offered shortstop Javier Baez as part of a three-player package and the Astros offered third baseman Alex Bregman for Fulmer and lefty reliever Justin Wilson.\n\nLast season, Baez, 26, finished second in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting. Bregman, 25, finished fifth in AL MVP voting. Both are considered franchise players.\n\nPassing on those deals was defensible: Both players had yet to break out and trading Fulmer — a pitcher who appeared to be a future ace, no matter his injury concerns — would have taken serious gumption, opening Avila up to strong criticism.\n\nBut the Tigers, at Fulmer’s peak value, ignored those injury concerns and passed. Fulmer’s subsequent injuries — a knee injury ended his 2018 season early and he underwent right elbow ligament reconstruction surgery in March, shelving him until mid-to-late 2020 – have eliminated him from trade consideration.\n\nIn recent seasons, to lesser degrees, they have operated similarly. They could have dealt Greene two offseasons ago, when he was coming off a solid season with three years of team control remaining — he regressed the next season — and Castellanos last summer, in the midst of a career year at the plate, when he could have offered a contender help in two pennant races.\n\nThose decisions led, indirectly at least, to the Greene and Castellanos deals on Wednesday, with Greene going for less than they had asked for and Castellanos departing for a package defined as reasonable only by how Avila had boxed himself into a corner over the past year.\n\nCastellanos: Public relations\n\nAfter the Tigers passed on moving Castellanos at last year’s trade deadline, they were unsuccessful in moving him after the season, thanks to a chilled free-agent market which featured comparable players for less than the Tigers were asking.\n\nThen, at TigerFest in January, Avila was asked about the trade market for Castellanos, who was not in attendance, “due to a previous commitment,” according to a team spokesperson.\n\n“Quite frankly, there has been no interest at this point,” Avila said.\n\nHonest to a fault, Avila’s public admission that Castellanos was receiving no interest did not help his marketability and reached the player, who, after years of being told he could not play defense, was now being told the Tigers didn’t want to offer him a contract extension and no other team wanted him, either.\n\nIt was, then, no surprise to Castellanos’ camp when word leaked two weeks before the trade deadline that a contract extension was considered close in spring training, delivering the message to the rest of the league: “Hey, we wanted him, so you should want him, too.”\n\nBut by that point, the damage had been done: Castellanos, who switched positions, emerged as a team leader, expressed a strong desire to stay with the Tigers and had played his best baseball, arrived at spring training as a lame duck, struggled through the first two months of the season and was never able to re-establish any sort of trade value.\n\nGreene: A shrinking market\n\nIn Greene’s case, the Tigers had been there before.\n\nThey were motivated to trade him two offseasons ago but the offers were underwhelming. So they held onto him; that wasn't an option given his peak value this season — a 1.18 ERA and 0.868 WHIP with 22 saves. They were not going to hold onto him again.\n\nBut in moving Greene – who was considered one of the best relievers on the market – the Tigers shot for the stars and missed.\n\nIn the hour leading up to the deadline, with the Nationals resisting a deal for either shortstop Carter Kieboom or infielder Luis Garcia and the Dodgers, too, considering the asking price too high, the Tigers asked Atlanta for Demeritte and catcher Alex Jackson, according to multiple persons with knowledge of the talks.\n\nThe Braves said no, and with nowhere else to go, the Tigers were forced to settle for Wentz as the highest-potential piece to go with Demeritte.\n\nThough Wentz is ranked higher than Jackson on many prospect lists, the Tigers have made no secret about their need for positional prospects, especially given the apparent whiffs on recent catching draft picks.\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that in his conference call following the trades, Avila mentioned the possibility of trading some of their pitching prospects for positional prospects in the future.\n\nBoyd: The waiting game?\n\nBut the biggest missed opportunity from this year’s trade deadline could be yet to come.\n\nMultiple executives indicated Boyd’s trade value will never be as high as it was at 3:59 p.m. on Wednesday. In the midst of a breakout season, the left-hander has three years of team control remaining. Though it remains a possibility that Boyd could stick around to head a rebuilt Tigers rotation, it seems unlikely the Tigers will dig out of this rebuilding without dealing at least one of these veteran for a highly-regarded hitting prospect.\n\nThere appeared to be a chasm between what the Tigers were asking for and how rival front offices viewed Boyd’s ability. That resulted in teams recoiling from the Tigers' asking price, cooling negotiations that could eventually have led to an acceptable offer.\n\n“Borderline comical,” one NL executive said of their price on Boyd.\n\n“Impossible to deal with,” an AL executive said of their reluctance to budge.\n\nWhy the Tigers were so inflexible is unclear, though some around baseball consider the front office risk-averse. Avila’s recent contract extension perhaps only furthers that: Why take a chance when you have time to wait?\n\nOne executive of a team that talked with the Tigers about multiple players leading up to the trade deadline said they were conscious of not leaking trade information regarding the Tigers. That official cited a situation in the offseason when the Mets pulled second baseman Jeff McNeil — an All-Star this season — from a trade with the Mariners after his inclusion became public.\n\nStill, trade offers leaked out: Budding superstar Gleyber Torres from the Yankees, according to the New York Post. Other requests included two of a team’s top three prospects and even four in some cases, according to multiple persons with knowledge of the talks. Those starting points discouraged negotiations rather than promoting them.\n\n“In Boyd’s case, in my gut, my heart, I didn’t think there was a trade there,” Avila said. “I think it was a little bit overstated, or overplayed, or overpublicized. But really, I didn’t think there was anything close on that.”\n\nOf course, rather than listening to his gut and heart, Avila could have listened to interested teams to find out for sure whether \"there was anything close.\"\n\nAvila said he told Boyd before the Tigers’ current road trip that he was unlikely to be traded. The road trip began a week before the trade deadline.\n\nIn the final four days before the deadline, three accomplished starting pitchers — right-handers Trevor Bauer, Zack Greinke and Marcus Stroman — were traded.\n\nBoyd, of course, doesn't have the track record of those players. Then again, his salary and additional years of team control are vastly more valuable. Those factors, along with the Tigers putting a Chris Sale-like price on Boyd — despite skepticism from the scouting community on Boyd's status as an ace — made a deal nearly impossible.\n\nA familiar result\n\nThe Tigers stuck to their asking prices and were forced to watch another deadline go by with no big prospect haul, especially when they failed to creatively package their assets.\n\nPackaging Castellanos likely would not have made a difference. But multiple executives mentioned that packaging Boyd and Greene — allowing teams to address two types of pitching needs in one move — could have brought back the kind of offensive prospects they desired.\n\nInstead, they accepted the status quo and moved piece-by-piece, only to get a “pretty good, considering the market” return.\n\nAnd though it takes two teams to deal, at some point, it becomes Avila’s responsibility to create a better market through reasonable asking prices, not devaluing his own assets and showing a better sense of timing.\n\nIt happened with Fulmer. Then J.D. Martinez. then Castellanos.\n\nAnd now, with nearly all of their trade assets spent, only one remains: Boyd.\n\nThey are once again rolling the dice that their bad timing won't prevent them from receiving the haul they desperately need.\n\nFollow Anthony Fenech on Twitter @anthonyfenech.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/10/28/nfl-100-famous-players-played-teams-forgot/4094685002/", "title": "NFL: 100 famous players who played for teams you forgot about", "text": "The NFL's annual trade deadline will pass Tuesday afternoon, and a few prominent names are bound to be headed for new homes.\n\nIt's a reminder that the league's players are constantly on the move, if not always via trades. But frequent roster churn tends to quickly dim memories of established players who made pit stops in unfamiliar cities — heck, recently dealt lineman Michael Bennett, who entered the NFL as a Buccaneer, is about to join his fourth club (Seahawks, Eagles, Patriots, Cowboys) in less than three full seasons.\n\nSo that got me thinking about current and past stars who have had forgettable stints in uniforms you might not recall. We're not going to insult your intelligence with luminaries who have recently bounced (Odell Beckham, Antonio Brown, Jadeveon Clowney) or those who shone for multiple franchises, say Peyton Manning or Adam Vinatieri. And don't want to bore you Millennials by going to deep into the vault for Y.A. Tittle or Night Train Lane.\n\nBut in the spirit of the NFL's 100th season, here's a list (certainly not exhaustive) of 100 guys who might have played in places you have no memory of — the objective being I want you to say, \"I totally forgot he played there\" or, even better, \"I never realized he played there.\"\n\n(Note: Guys whose rights were traded — Eli Manning and Philip Rivers, for example — but didn't play in some capacity for multiple teams were not considered.)\n\nOn to the list, which is organized alphabetically ...\n\n1. RB Shaun Alexander: The record-setting 2005 MVP in Seattle, he rushed for 24 yards in his final four games for Washington in 2008.\n\n2. DE Jared Allen: The colorful quarterback roper for the Chiefs and Vikings split his final two seasons with the Bears and Panthers.\n\n3. G Larry Allen: A legendary strongman in Dallas, he finished out his career with arch rival San Francisco in 2006 and 2007.\n\n4. K Morten Andersen: One of two pure kickers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he retired as the league's all-time leading scorer, topping the career charts for both the Saints and Falcons, too. However Andersen was a nomad from 2001 through 2004, suiting up for the Giants, Chiefs and Vikings.\n\n5. S Steve Atwater: The popular Bronco played his final season for the Jets, one of many greats on this list who limped to the finish line with Gang Green.\n\n6. CB Champ Bailey: Another Broncos great, you'll likely recall he began his career with Washington in 1999 before being traded — with a second-round pick! — for Clinton Portis in 2004. But do you remember Bailey spending the 2014 preseason with the Saints before retiring?\n\n7. TE Mark Bavaro: One of the most dominant dual-threat tight ends ever, Bavaro played briefly for the Browns and Eagles after leaving the Giants.\n\n8. RB Jerome Bettis: He may seem like a prototypical Steeler, but he won 1993 offensive rookie of the year honors with the Los Angeles Rams and spent 1995 on the Busch Stadium turf for the St. Louis Rams.\n\n9. QB Drew Bledsoe: You know he was replaced by Tom Brady in New England and was subsequently dealt to Buffalo. Bledsoe later got Wally Pipp'd by Tony Romo in Dallas.\n\n10. WR Anquan Boldin: After seven years with Arizona, he remained a highly productive player for the Ravens and 49ers. He played his last year for the Lions in 2016 but did don a Bills uniform in the summer of 2017 before retiring.\n\nGREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME:Who tops our list of the 100 best?\n\nNFL's 100 WORST TEAMS:Who were most hopeless squads in history?\n\n11. WR Tim Brown: The longtime Raiders star played his 17th and final season in Tampa.\n\n12. WR Isaac Bruce: After shining with the Rams for 14 seasons, he concluded his career in San Francisco.\n\n13. QB Mark Brunell: Jacksonville's all-time leading passer also started in Washington for three seasons. He spent the balance of his career backing up Brett Favre in Green Bay, Drew Brees in New Orleans and Mark Sanchez in New York.\n\n14. WR Dez Bryant: Had you already forgotten about that ill-fated practice in New Orleans when he tore his Achilles before he could play a game for the Saints in 2018?\n\n15. RB Reggie Bush: If you were asked how many teams he played for, would you have answered five? He was featured in New Orleans, Miami and Detroit. Not San Francisco, and certainly not Buffalo, where he \"rushed\" for minus-3 yards in his final season.\n\n16. RB Earl Campbell: Probably the greatest Houston Oiler, he spent his final 1½ seasons in New Orleans.\n\n17. WR Cris Carter: Minnesota's all-time leading receiver entered the NFL with the Eagles and left as a Dolphin.\n\n18. TE Dave Casper: The Hall of Fame \"Ghost\" is closely associated with the Raiders, for whom he began and ended his 11-year career. But he played 48 combined games for the Oilers and Vikings before finishing up with the L.A. Raiders in 1984.\n\n19. RB Jamaal Charles: You likely remember the Chiefs' all-time leading rusher taking a one-year detour to Denver. But what about his two-game cup of coffee in Jacksonville?\n\n20. TE Dallas Clark: One of Peyton Manning's trusted targets was also a Buccaneer and Raven. Seriously.\n\n21. RB Larry Csonka: Did you know it was Csonka, then with the Giants, who was involved in the ill-fated handoff that led to Philadelphia's miraculous \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\" victory in 1978?\n\n22. QB Randall Cunningham: You knew he starred for the Eagles and resurrected himself in Minnesota. But do you remember him wrapping his career as a backup for the Cowboys and Ravens?\n\n23. QB Len Dawson: Before becoming a champion and Super Bowl MVP for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs, he muddled through the early part of his career with the Steelers and Browns.\n\n24. RB Eric Dickerson: His 1987 trade from the Rams to the Colts was one of the more stunning in league history. His stops with the Raiders and Falcons and a failed physical in Green Bay to end his career are largely forgotten.\n\n25. TE Mike Ditka: He's synonymous with the Bears as a player and coach. But he also played for the Eagles and won a Super Bowl as a member of the Cowboys.\n\n26. RB Tony Dorsett: The longtime Dallas star concluded his 12-year career in Denver.\n\n27. QB Boomer Esiason: The biggest passing game of his career (522 yards) occurred when he was a Cardinal.\n\n28. G Alan Faneca: Arguably one of the two best guards to play in the last 15 years (keep reading to learn the other), he played for the Jets and Cardinals after spending a decade in Pittsburgh.\n\n29. RB Marshall Faulk: The centerpiece of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams was drafted by the Colts in 1994 before being traded.\n\n30. QB Brett Favre: Prior to becoming King in the North, he partied a little too much for the Dirty South Falcons, who drafted him in 1991. And prior to becoming the Hand of the King (Aaron Rodgers?) while in Minnesota, Favre tried to play through a bit too much pain for the Jets in 2008.\n\nNFL's 100 GREATEST TEAMS OF ALL TIME:Which squad is best in league history?\n\n31. QB Nick Foles: He's now with the Jaguars ... remember? He used to start for the St. Louis Rams ... remember? He used to back up Alex Smith in Kansas City ... remember?\n\n32. DE Dwight Freeney: He didn't finish his illustrious career with the Colts — right, right. But he played for the Chargers, Cardinals, Falcons, Seahawks and Lions? Whoa.\n\n33. RB Eddie George: Oiler? Oh yeah. Titan? Of course. Cowboy? Huh?\n\n34. OLB Kevin Greene: No linebacker tops his 160 career sacks. Maybe you associated the bulk of his production with the L.A. Rams or Steelers ... though he played as many seasons as Carolina (three) as he did in Pittsburgh, plus another in San Francisco.\n\n35. RB Franco Harris: His bid to break Jim Brown's career rushing record (at the time) came up just short in Seattle in 1984.\n\n36. OLB James Harrison: Stop reading, Steelers fans ... OK, Harrison also spent time with the Ravens and Bengals before wrapping his career with the hated Patriots. Welp, at least he didn't join the Browns, too.\n\n37. QB Matt Hasselbeck: The first man to quarterback the Seahawks to a Super Bowl started his career as Favre's backup, ended it as Andrew Luck's and started 21 games for the Titans while mentoring Jake Locker.\n\n38. KR Devin Hester: The return man extraordinaire should go into the Hall after accruing his record 20 non-offensive TDs, one coming with Atlanta. Hester also spent the 2016 regular season in Baltimore. But only diehards will recall his final two games in the 2016 playoffs ... with Seattle.\n\n39. RB Priest Holmes: The fantasy stud to have from 2001 to 2003 during his time with the Chiefs, he spent the first four years of his career as an undrafted free agent with the Ravens.\n\n40. WR Torry Holt: Almost to a man, those great St. Louis Rams players faded into virtual anonymity. Holt's last catch came as a Jaguar. He tried to latch on with the Patriots but didn't make it out of training camp.\n\n41. G Steve Hutchinson: The league's best guard post-Larry Allen in my judgment — Let's get him into the Hall next year, please — Mr. \"Poison Pill\" starred in Seattle and Minnesota before hanging up his spurs with Tennessee.\n\n42. RB Steven Jackson: Talk about poor timing. He missed the heyday of The Greatest Show on Turf, was stuck on two bad Atlanta teams and finished up with the Patriots — yes — during a year (2015) they failed to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n43. RB Edgerrin James: If you thought his final game occurred in a Cardinals uniform, you'd be wrong. It came in Seattle's threads.\n\n44. QB Ron Jaworski: If you know your NFL history, then you know the first man to lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl was drafted by the Rams in 1973. If you're really good, then you know \"Jaws\" was a backup in Miami and Kansas City during his final two seasons.\n\n45. WR Andre Johnson: The greatest Houston Texan prior to the arrival of J.J. Watt, Johnson wound down his career by touring with other AFC South teams (Colts, Titans).\n\n46. WR Chad Johnson: Ochocinco made his bones — and was a must-watch performer thanks to his frequent celebrations — in Cincinnati. But he reached the Super Bowl during a quiet 2011 season with the Patriots before his career came to an unfortunate end before he played a regular-season game for the Dolphins.\n\n47. WR Keyshawn Johnson: A No. 1 overall draft pick of the Jets and Super Bowl champ with the Bucs, his final seasons were with the Cowboys and Panthers.\n\n48. DE Deacon Jones: The man who coined the term \"sack\" was a relentless force for the Rams. But his career quietly ended amid stints in San Diego, where he was a teammate of fellow over-the-hiller Johnny Unitas, and Washington.\n\n49. CB Ty Law: He just entered the Hall of Fame, deservedly recognized for his role at the roots of the Patriots dynasty. But Law's final years were spent as a mercenary for the Jets (twice), Chiefs and Broncos.\n\n50. DB Ronnie Lott: Perhaps the greatest safety ever, his final four seasons were split between the Raiders and Jets. He even signed with the Chiefs but never played for them.\n\n51. TE John Mackey: He and Ditka revolutionized their position. Mackey spent most of his 10-year career trucking through defenses for the Baltimore Colts before his final year with the Chargers.\n\n52. QB Archie Manning: Peyton's and Eli's dad was the first great player in Saints history, though was never surrounded by much talent. His final three seasons were divided between New Orleans, Houston and Minnesota.\n\n53. WR Brandon Marshall: You know he was a vagabond, but can you name all seven teams that issued him paychecks? Stumped? ... Broncos, Dolphins, Bears, Jets, Giants, Seahawks and Saints, though he never played in a game for New Orleans.\n\n54. G Randall McDaniel: He was a Pro Bowler 11 times for the Vikings ... and once for the Buccaneers.\n\n55. QB Donovan McNabb: Bit of a shock when the Eagles traded him to the Redskins. His abbreviated hitch with the Vikings is hazier ... probably because he lost his job to Christian Ponder.\n\n56. WR Art Monk: He set several league receiving records during his 14 years with the Redskins, though their fans shudder to think that Monk wound up wearing jerseys for the Jets and hated Eagles.\n\n57. QB Joe Montana: You doubtless knew he finished with the Chiefs, but didn't want to exclude him from the list for those born after 1994.\n\n58. QB Warren Moon: He spent most of his illustrious career lofting those beautiful spirals for the Oilers. He was also a Pro Bowler for the Vikings and Seahawks before carrying a clipboard in Kansas City. (And just imagine his numbers had he not had to prove himself for six years with the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos.)\n\n59. WR Randy Moss: \"The Freak\" immediately vaulted to superstardom with the Vikings. You might only know he \"played\" for the Raiders because Oakland traded him to New England. After that? Moss actually went back to the Vikings, then joined the Titans and nearly won that elusive Super Bowl ring during his final season in San Francisco.\n\n60. QB Joe Namath: Broadway Joe hung it up on the Sunset Strip after an anticlimactic season with the Rams.\n\n61. WR Terrell Owens: Let's play the Brandon Marshall Game. Ready? Go — 49ers, Eagles, Cowboys, Bills and Bengals. Shoulda been a Raven, too. T.O. also joined the Allen Wranglers, an indoor team, nearly played for the Seahawks and almost went the CFL route.\n\n62. LT Orlando Pace: Another jettisoned Rams star. Pace's last season occurred in Chicago.\n\n63. DT Alan Page: The only defensive lineman to earn league MVP honors, Page was the most dangerous of those Purple People Eaters. But like Pace, Page's curtain came down in the Windy City.\n\n64. QB Carson Palmer: Among the best passers in the checkered histories of the Bengals and Cardinals. The same does not apply to the Raiders.\n\n65. DE/OLB Julius Peppers: Does it seem like he's only been retired a few months? Did it seem like he played 17 years, his Carolina sandwich filled with sacks from Chicago and Green Bay?\n\n66. RB Adrian Peterson: Nice to see his old Vikings fans shower the current Redskins back with applause last week. In the interim did you erase memories of AD strapping it up for the Saints and Cardinals?\n\n67. DT John Randle: Yet another longtime Viking, he actually played three years with Seattle before retiring.\n\n68. FS Ed Reed: It still boggles the mind that his final season in 2013 was divided between the Texans and Jets.\n\n69. CB Darrelle Revis: He wasn't a Jets teammate of Reed's in 2013, because Revis was with the Buccaneers. The next year he won a ring in New England (man, time flies). After two more years with the Jets, you're forgiven if you don't recollect Revis' abbreviated tenure with the 2017 Chiefs.\n\n70. WR Jerry Rice: The original GOAT, we still can't quite believe Rice crossed the Bay from San Francisco to Oakland in 2001. Wait, the Seahawks also let him wear Steve Largent's No. 80 for 11 games? Wait, he almost played for the Broncos in 2005 before retiring rather than accept a limited role? Crazy stuff.\n\n71. S Bob Sanders: Man, the 2007 defensive player of the year was a force when he was healthy ... which was all too rare. His final two games were spent in a Chargers uniform.\n\n72. CB Deion Sanders: Still can't believe he came out of retirement to wear No. 37 for the Ravens. Cowboys fans have probably also erased Prime Time's year in Washington from the memory banks.\n\n73. C Jeff Saturday: His NFL life began with the Ravens in 1998, though he didn't even play a preseason game for them, and ended with Saturday snapping to Aaron Rodgers. You know about the rest.\n\n74. RB O.J. Simpson: 49ers faithful probably still cringe at the thought of surrendering five high draft picks, including a first rounder, for the Juice's forgettable final two seasons.\n\n75. DE Bruce Smith: His record 200th sack came with Washington.\n\n76. RB Emmitt Smith: The last of his record 18,355 rushing yards came with Arizona.\n\n77. QB Kenny Stabler: The Snake slithered out of Oakland after a decade of Hall of Fame service but hung on for five more years in Houston and New Orleans.\n\n78. CB Aqib Talib: Does it seem like the Dolphins are his fifth team? Do you have any memory of him as a Buccaneer?\n\n79. QB Fran Tarkenton: The NFL's most prolific passer pre-Marino, Tarkenton's reign in Minnesota was interrupted by a five-year interlude with the Giants.\n\n80. RB Fred Taylor: Jacksonville's all-time leading rusher picked up another 424 yards on the ground for New England between 2009 and 2010.\n\n81. DE/OLB Jason Taylor: Spent a year with the Redskins, then went back to Miami. Spent a year with the Jets — reaching a championship game for the only time — then went back to Miami.\n\n82. QB Tim Tebow: He worked miracles for the Broncos in 2011 ... then barely worked at all for the Jets. But had you mentally deleted his breathlessly covered tryouts with the Patriots (2013) and Eagles (2015) before he became a Mets farmhand?\n\n83. RB Thurman Thomas: Buffalo's one-time league MVP spent his 13th and final season in Miami.\n\n84. LB Zach Thomas: A little odd this five-time all-pro hasn't gotten more Hall of Fame consideration. He played one year for the Cowboys after a dozen for the Dolphins.\n\n85. RB LaDainian Tomlinson: In case anyone forgot he played for both the Chargers and Jets (especially the Jets), LT tattooed his calves with the teams' logos.\n\n86. DE Justin Tuck: After achieving glory with the Giants, he finished quietly with the Raiders.\n\n87. DE Osi Umenyiora: After achieving glory with the Giants, he finished quietly with the Falcons.\n\n88. QB Johnny Unitas: He was drafted by the Steelers but never got a chance to play for them. He joined the Chargers for his final season and barely got a chance to play for them. In between those gigs, pretty good.\n\n89. QB Michael Vick: Indelible memories of his highlights for the Falcons and his second chance with the Eagles. But none from his time with the Jets and Steelers.\n\n90. RB Herschel Walker: His 1989 trade from the Cowboys to the Vikings was a pivotal moment in NFL history. His times with the Eagles and Giants, not to mention his Dallas return, were not.\n\n91. QB Kurt Warner: He lifted the Rams and Cardinals to heights rarely seen by those franchises. He also spent a year in New York tutoring Eli Manning.\n\n92. WR Reggie Wayne: He decided to join the Patriots in the 2015 preseason ... and decided two weeks later that he was fine not playing for them.\n\n93. C Mike Webster: Very few of Pittsburgh's \"Steel Curtain\" era royalty moved on to new NFL homes. But Webster was an exception, winding up in Kansas City for his final two seasons.\n\n94. WR Wes Welker: Did you know the undrafted free agent originally signed with the Chargers? Or that he spent three seasons in Miami? Or that following his years of ridiculous productivity with Brady and Peyton Manning, he played one final year in St. Louis?\n\n95. DE Reggie White: Admit it, you forgot he unretired in 2000 to play a season for the Panthers ... and finished with a career-low 5½ sacks.\n\n96. DT Vince Wilfork: Didn't get to finish up in New England, but he did so in Houston.\n\n97. DE Mario Williams: The No. 1 pick of the 2006 draft by the Texans, Williams' final five years were passed in the AFC East with Buffalo and Miami.\n\n98. RB Ricky Williams: While I mostly wanted to drop a Toronto Argonauts reference, don't forget he played for the Ravens in 2011.\n\n99. DB Rod Woodson: He's best known for his stellar decade in Pittsburgh and, secondarily, being a pillar of the famed 2000 Ravens defense. But Woodson also played in the Bay Area for both the 49ers and Raiders.\n\n100. QB Steve Young: Before becoming a two-time league MVP for the Niners, he suffered two brutal seasons in Tampa Bay (his time with the Bucs following his professional debut with the USFL's L.A. Express).\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

There was even a picture of the right-hander offered as proof.\n\nVerlander was indeed still a member of the Detroit Tigers when Monday's non-waiver trade deadline came and went. Although the Tigers dealt J.D. Martinez, Justin Wilson and Alex Avila in the last two weeks before the deadline, they kept some of their biggest names. Detroit remains with the only major league team Verlander's ever played for, and Ian Kinsler wasn't traded either.\n\n\"I do not have a mandate to dump salary,\" general manager Al Avila said.\n\nThe Tigers held onto Verlander and his big contract, instead dealing Martinez, Wilson and Avila in an effort to add some quality young position players to the organization. It's no surprise that Detroit parted ways with those three. Martinez and Avila can become free agents after this season, and Wilson — who became the closer in Detroit earlier this year — is probably worth more to a contending team than to the sub.-500 Tigers.\n\nDetroit acquired minor league infielders Jeimer Candelario and Isaac Paredes from the Chicago Cubs in the trade for Wilson and Avila. The Tigers sent Martinez to Arizona on July 18 for minor leaguers Dawel Lugo, Sergio Alcantara and Jose King — all infielders as well.\n\nAlthough Al Avila said the Tigers aren't simply shedding payroll, speculation will continue to swirl around some of their more expensive players. Justin Upton can opt out of his contract after this season, and the Tigers have a team option on Kinsler. Verlander's deal calls for him to be paid $28 million in both 2018 and 2019, and it includes a $22 million vesting option in 2020 that becomes guaranteed if he's in the top five of the 2019 Cy Young vote.\n\nDetroit hasn't made the postseason since 2014, and the team is now clearly in a transition phase. Trading Verlander could certainly give the Tigers more financial flexibility over the next couple seasons, but it's not clear how much that would really make a difference.\n\nThe bigger issue is how quickly Detroit can reap the benefits of acquiring more prospects. Two years ago, the Tigers traded David Price and Yoenis Cespedes at the deadline, receiving pitchers Michael Fulmer, Daniel Norris and Matthew Boyd in return. Fulmer was the 2016 American League Rookie of the Year, while Norris and Boyd have had their ups and downs.\n\nThat's often the case with younger players. They develop at different speeds, and it's hard to predict who will pan out. The 23-year-old Candelario plays third base, and Detroit's major league starter at that position, Nicholas Castellanos, is only 25.\n\nAvila said he wasn't overly concerned about positional variety when bringing in prospects. At this point, the Tigers need good young players, no matter where they might fit in.\n\n\"If it happened to be two third basemen as opposed to let's say a third baseman and a shortstop, you still go for the best talent that you can acquire,\" the general manager said. \"No different than what we do in the draft. Later on, if you had to fill in a gap here and there, then you go out and get a minor league free agent. So really, this has nothing to do with Nick Castellanos or anybody on the major league club. This has to do with refilling our organization with prospects at the minor league level.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick in New York contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/08/02/mlb-trade-deadline-live-updates-rumors-news-tuesday/10209474002/", "title": "MLB trade deadline: Juan Soto to Padres tops MLB deals, signings ...", "text": "Juan Soto’s trade to the San Diego Padres was the top headline on MLB’s trade deadline day, but some other big names were dealt as contenders jockey for the stretch run.\n\nEarlier in the day, the 23-year-old Soto was traded by Washington just three years after winning the World Series. The Nationals got MacKenzie Gore, Luke Voit and four prospects in exchange for the next 2½ years of Soto’s career.\n\nAmong a flurry of moves before clock struck 6 p.m. ET, the Atlanta Braves landed reliever Raisel Iglesias, the Blue Jays got two-time All-Star Whit Merrifield and the Phillies made a deal for starter Noah Syndergaard.\n\nCatch up on everything that happened Tuesday:\n\nPreviously-unvaxxed Whit Merrifield going to the Blue Jays\n\nThe Royals sent utility man Whit Merrifield to the Blue Jays just minutes before Tuesday’s trade deadline, even though the two-time All-Star was unvaccinated against COVID-19 and had to miss Kansas City’s trip to Toronto last month.\n\nMerrifield drew the ire of Royals fans when, prior to their trip to Toronto, he said: “Something happens and I happen to get on a team that has a chance to go play in Canada in the postseason, maybe that changes.”\n\nMerrifield is making $7 million this season and is due $2.75 million next season along with a $4 million bonus for spending fewer than 110 days on the injured list in 2022.

Los Angeles is getting lefty Tucker Davidson and righty Jesse Chavez in return.\n\nThe 32-year-old Iglesias received Cy Young votes last season and signed a four-year $58 million extension with the Angels this past offseason. His 3.17 FIP (4.04 ERA) suggest that he's been unlucky so far in 2022. Iglesias joins closer Kenley Jansen and lefty A.J. Minter in the late innings for the Braves, who dealt reliever Will Smith earlier in the week.\n\nOther MLB trade deadline deals\n\nYankees, Cardinals swap Jordan Montgomery and Harrison Bader\n\nMinutes before Tuesday’s 6 p.m. MLB trade deadline, the Yankees cleared roster space in an unanticipated manner.\n\nLefty starter Jordan Montgomery was shipped to the St. Louis Cardinals for center fielder Harrison Bader, who is currently on the injured list due to plantar fasciitis.\n\nThe left-handed Montgomery, 29, was having a solid season, posting a 3.69 ERA in 21 starts.\n\nBader, 28, a right-handed hitter, was batting .256 with a .673 OPS in 72 games, with 15 stolen bases in 17 attempts.\n\n– Pete Caldera, NorthJersey.com\n\nEric Hosmer heading to Red Sox on roller-coaster day\n\nOriginally part of San Diego's package in the Juan Soto trade, veteran first baseman Eric Hosmer utilized his no-trade clause to nix a deal to Washington before the Padres ended up trading him to the Red Sox.\n\nThe Red Sox are sending pitching prospect Jay Groome to the Padres in exchange for Hosmer and prospects Corey Rosier and Max Ferguson. Hosmer is due $39 million from 2023-2025 and Boston will also receive cash in the deal\n\nPadres get Brandon Drury in latest deal\n\nSan Diego followed up on the Soto trade by making a move for Reds utilityman Brandon Drury, who was enjoying a career year in Cincinnati with 20 HR and 59 RBI in 92 games.\n\nThe 29-year-old has played all four infield positions this year – primarily third base – and has experience in the outfield. Drury could get at-bats at designated hitter the Padres' new-look lineup with Soto and first baseman Josh Bell.\n\nThe Reds are getting 18-year-old shortstop prospect Victor Acosta, the Padres' sixth-ranked prospect (after the Soto trade) according to MLB.com.\n\nTwins make move for Reds righty Tyler Mahle\n\nWith two of the best pitchers available on the trade market, the Cincinnati Reds opted to boost their farm system. The Reds traded right-handed starting pitcher Tyler Mahle to the Minnesota Twins for a group of three prospects Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe prospects include infielder Spencer Steer, left-hander Steven Hajjar and third baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand. Steer is the headliner, rated No. 4 in the Twins' organization by Baseball America. Hajjar is rated No. 11 and Encarnacion-Strand is ranked No. 14.\n\nMahle had a 5-7 record and a 4.40 ERA in 19 starts with the Reds this season, striking out 114 and walking 39 in 104 1/3 innings. He made two starts ahead of the trade deadline after a stint on the 15-day injured list with a right shoulder strain.\n\nIt’s the second time the Reds have traded a starting pitcher to the Twins this season. They swapped Sonny Gray for pitching prospect Chase Petty in March.\n\n– Bobby Nightengale, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nDavid Robertson to close for Phillies\n\nSeemingly always in the market for bullpen help, the Philadelphia Phillies struck a deal with the Chicago Cubs for closer David Robertson.\n\nAn All-Star in 2011 with the New York Yankees, Robertson made only 19 appearances from 2019-21 because of injuries. However, he's rebounded in a big way with the Cubs this year, posting a 2.23 ERA with 14 saves.\n\nClass A right-hander Ben Brown, 22, goes to Chicago in the deal.\n\nNL East contenders set to add outfielders\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies have struck a deal to land outfielder Brandon Marsh from the Los Angeles Angels. In return, the Angels receive catching prospect Logan O'Hoppe, FanSided's Robert Murray reports.\n\nMarsh, 24, is a speedy outfielder who can fill the Phillies need in center. However, he has the highest strikeout rate of any qualified hitter in the majors this season at 36.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Mets are acquiring outfielder/first baseman Darin Ruf from the San Francisco Giants in exchange for veteran third baseman J.D. Davis and prospects, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\nRuf, who has a .886 OPS vs. left-handers this season, gives the Mets a right-handed complement to lefty sluggers Dan Vogelbach and Tyler Naquin, who were also acquired just before the deadline.\n\nDodgers acquire OF Joey Gallo from Yankees\n\nOne of the surest bets of this year's trade deadline was that the New York Yankees would part ways with outfielder Joey Gallo, whom they acquired to much fanfare at last year's trade deadline.\n\nHowever, in Gallo's one year in the Bronx, he has gone from an All-Star and Gold Glove defender to a struggling part-timer. In 140 games in pinstripes, he has produced a .159/.291/.368 slash line with 25 home runs and a whopping 194 strikeouts.\n\nIn a recent interview, Gallo was quite candid about his struggles, both physically and mentally, in New York.\n\nOnce the Yankees picked up left-handed hitting outfielder Andrew Benintendi from the Royals, Gallo's days were clearly numbered.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to send 23-year-old Class AA right-hander Clayton Beeter to the Yankees for Gallo, according to multiple media reports.\n\nBeeter is the Dodgers' No. 15 prospect, according to MLB.com.\n\nBlue Jays bolster bullpen in deal with Marlins\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays added a pair of relievers for the stretch run, acquiring right-handers Anthony Bass and Zach Pop from the Miami Marlins for shortstop prospect Jordan Groshans.\n\nBass has been outstanding this season, with a 1.41 ERA, 0.94 WHIP and just one home run allowed over 44 ⅔ innings. Pop has split time between Miami and Class AAA Jacksonville. They'll provide depth behind closer Jason Romano.\n\nGroshans, a top-100 overall prospect entering this season, has struggled at Class AAA Buffalo, posting a .250/.348/.296 slash line with one home run in 279 plate appearances.\n\nJuan Soto trade to Padres now official\n\nThe San Diego Padres are making a huge statement in their bid to reach the World Series by landing the trade deadline's biggest prize, agreeing to acquire All-Star outfielder Juan Soto and first baseman Josh Bell from the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn return, the Nationals receive first baseman Luke Voit, left-hander MacKenzie Gore and a package of four prospects, shortstop C.J. Abrams, outfielders Robert Hassell III and James Wood, and right-hander Jarlin Susana.\n\nANALYSIS: Padres show they're all-in with Soto, Hader acquisitions\n\nVeteran first baseman Eric Hosmer was originally part of the Nationals' haul for Soto and Bell -- however, he has a limited no-trade clause that prohibited him from being traded to several teams, including the Nationals, without his permission.\n\nHowever, Voit was later added to the trade so it could be finalized.\n\nEarlier this season, the Soto turned down a record-breaking 15-year, $440 million contract offer to stay with the Nationals. Even though the deal would have been the largest in baseball history, it would only average $29.33 million per year -- making him the 20th highest-paid player in annual value.\n\nTwins pick up Orioles closer Jorge Lopez\n\nDesperate for bullpen help, the Minnesota Twins have acquired 2022 AL All-Star Jorge Lopez from the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe O's will receive left-hander Cade Povich, right-handed reliever Yennier Cano and additional low-level prospects in exchange for the 29-year-old Lopez.\n\nIn by far the best season of his seven-year career, Lopez has made the transition from struggling starter (3-14, 6.07 ERA in 2021) to lights-out closer -- converting 19 of 23 save chances and pitching to an ERA of 1.68 in 44 appearances.\n\nThe Twins have gone through several closers after trading 2021 All-Star Taylor Rogers to the Padres this spring. Emilio Pagan leads the team with nine saves, but has blown six other save chances and has an ERA of 4.75. Five other Twins relievers have picked up at least one save.\n\nFantasy winners and losers (so far) from deadline deals\n\nMLB teams aren't the only ones looking to improve their rosters at the trade deadline. In the upcoming issue of USA TODAY Sports Weekly, Steve Gardner offers his winners and losers from a fantasy standpoint. Here are a few of each:\n\nWINNERS\n\nSP Luis Castillo, Mariners. Somehow, Castillo managed to put up a 2.86 ERA and 1.07 WHIP with Cincinnati – in one of the most homer-happy ballparks in the majors. In Seattle, he’ll have a much more neutral home park and a better defense behind him. The schedule helps as well with the M's having 25 games left against sub-.500 division opponents the Angels, Rangers and A's -- and none against the first-place Astros.\n\nRP Devin Williams, Brewers. MLB saves leader Josh Hader's fantasy value wasn’t going to change whether or not he changed teams. Once he did though, going from the Brewers to the Padres, Williams’ immediately becomes a top-10 fantasy closer in Milwaukee. Possibly top five. (The Orioles' Felix Bautista gets a similar boost in value with Jorge Lopez traded to Minnesota.)\n\n1B Trey Mancini, Astros. Mancini was one of the hitters most impacted by the Orioles moving the left field wall back 30 feet this season. After hitting 14 homers at Camden Yards a year ago, Mancini had just five there this season (one of them of the inside-the-park variety). Hitting fly balls at a career-high rate, the Crawford Boxes in Houston, by comparison, should seem like just a short pop fly away for Mancini.\n\nLOSERS\n\nSP Frankie Montas, Yankees. With the Mariners landing Castillo first, the Yankees made a strong and successful push for the No. 2 starting pitcher on the market. Montas’ 4-9 record belies his excellent 3.18 ERA and 1.18 WHIP. However, he has taken full advantage of the spacious Oakland Coliseum this season. Over 12 starts in Oakland, Montas has a 2.06 ERA; in seven starts on the road, his ERA is over 5.00.\n\nOF David Peralta, Rays. Primarily a platoon hitter, Peralta shouldn’t see much of a change in his role playing primarily against right-handers. However, the AL East is the toughest division in the majors and the Rays like to tweak their lineups more than most teams. The Rays also acquired outfielder Jose Siri on Monday and should have Manuel Margot and Harold Ramirez coming back off the injured list soon.\n\nFantasy managers in AL- and NL-only leagues. This could change with a flurry of activity on deadline day. But as the final 24 hours of trading began ticking down, the number of inter-division deals was disappointingly small. Perhaps the possibility of a Juan Soto trade has kept a number of other deals on hold. No matter the reason, hoarding one’s FAAB dollars until the last minute in hopes of grabbing a superstar from the opposite league seems to be yet again a dangerous gamble.\n\nPadres front-runners in Soto sweepstakes?\n\nThe San Diego Padres are now seen by multiple observers as the \"most motivated\" team to put together a package for Juan Soto, in the words of The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal.\n\nThey have several high-level prospects -- including shortstop C.J. Abrams and outfielder Robert Hassell III -- which would be essential to creating a package the Nationals would accept.\n\nBarry Svrluga of the Washington Post goes even further, calling the Padres the \"most likely landing spot\" for Soto. In addition, he says the Padres could also acquire first baseman Josh Bell as part of a Soto deal.\n\nWhat makes the Padres different from the other rumored suitors for Soto is that they might have a bit more trouble getting him to sign a long-term extension before he becomes a free agent at the end of the 2024 season. That's because they already have two huge contracts already on the books in Fernando Tatis (14 years, $340 million) and Manny Machado (10 years, $340 million). However, Machado's contract does allow him to opt out after the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY's Bob Nightengale, the Padres wouldn't necessarily have to deplete their farm system for years to come if they acquired Soto. They could always trade him for more top prospects before he becomes a free agent.\n\n5 biggest trades from Monday\n\nYankees land Frankie Montas, have improved everywhere\n\nThe New York Yankees have been sitting atop the baseball world all season, but were much more worried about their team than they ever publicly revealed.\n\nSo, what did they do?\n\nThey grabbed Oakland A’s ace Frankie Montas on Monday when they couldn’t get Cincinnati Reds ace Luis Castillo. They passed on Brewers All-Star closer Josh Hader, who went to San Diego, but turned around and acquired Oakland closer Lou Trivino in the Montas trade. They acquired Cubs rookie reliever Scott Effross, too. They’re out on the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but acquired Andrew Benintendi from the Kansas City Royals last week.\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrewers think they can still win without Josh Hader\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers let teams know early in July that four-time All-Star closer Josh Hader was available, believing they could still win the NL Central without him, but warned the asking price would be steep.\n\nWell, they soon will find out if they’re correct in their assessment, trading Hader to the San Diego Padres on Monday for closer Trevor Rogers, starter Dinelson Lamet, pitching prospect Robert Gasser and outfield prospect Esteury Ruiz.\n\n\"Trading good players on good teams is difficult, and that certainly is the case with Josh,\" Brewers president David Stearns said. \"We also recognize that to give our organization the best chance for sustained competitiveness, to avoid the extended down periods that so many organizations experience, we must make decisions that are not easy.\"\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2022 Tigers weren't supposed to be sellers. How it all went wrong.\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when the Detroit Tigers envisioned a much different approach at the 2022 trade deadline — 6 p.m. Tuesday, less than two hours before they play the Twins in Minnesota.\n\nOn paper, the Tigers were lined up to compete. But on the field, due to myriad injuries and poor performances, the Tigers have the third-worst record in the AL, and the offense — averaging 3.21 runs per game — is one of the worst in baseball history.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sure our guys realize we put ourselves in this situation,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"We have to deal with the consequences of the stress, anxiousness, curiosity and the reality that, if I was on the outside and I had a contending club, I would have a few pieces that I would want here, too.\"\n\n– Evan Petzold, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/08/02/juan-soto-trade-leaves-nationals-starless-and-stunned-mlb-deadline/10218128002/", "title": "After decade 'unmatched by few teams,' Juan Soto trade leaves ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – For a decade, they dominated more than they didn’t, almost always in championship contention, the greatest club on the planet for a fleeting moment.\n\nTuesday morning, the Washington Nationals finally imploded it all, leaving behind an unsettled future and a score of scarred, scrambling parties in their wake.\n\nA scorned star. A defiant general manager. A stunned clubhouse. A tearful manager. A confused fan base.\n\nThat’s the power of Juan Soto, the 23-year-old superstar who is off to try and win a World Series with the San Diego Padres but will be remembered around here as the last man through the door, the last in a quintet of superstars who etched baseball on the map here yet were shown the door to other forever homes.\n\nNo departure, however, was more jarring: Soto, still more than two years from free agency and the greatest hitter of his generation, shipped cross country less than three weeks after he turned down a contract proposal and then was jarred by the revelation of its details.\n\nYou could call that afternoon – July 16, 2022 – the day it all really ended here, when the Nationals’ desire to seek a trade for their star after he turned down a $29 million per year offer went public.\n\nSOTO TO SAN DIEGO: Padres go all-in with blockbuster trade\n\nJOEY GALLO: Traded to Dodgers, slugger reflects on Yankee struggles\n\nThe details – incidental, really – emerged Tuesday morning when the Nationals struck a deal for four prospects and big league slugger Luke Voit in exchange for Soto and respected first baseman Josh Bell. A so-called reboot became an official teardown.\n\nAnd the final acknowledgment that a championship window that crested with that 2019 World Series title arrived with a numbing finality.\n\n“That flag’s gonna fly forever, for sure,” says reliever Sean Doolittle, one of the last pieces of the title club still milling about, “but this stinks.”\n\nIt probably stinks just a bit less for Soto. He will bat between Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr. in San Diego, where the money, the superstars and the trove of prospects to replenish it all flow like a horchata to wash down your fish taco.\n\nBut Soto loved it here, bought a house here, counseled less experienced hitters roughly his age like a seasoned vet, shuffled into the heart of fans. Now he must pack, presumably sell a house, got through an emotional goodbye with manager Dave Martinez.\n\nYet weep not for Soto.\n\n“The first time I got traded,” says designated hitter Nelson Cruz, whose poor first half ensured he’d be stuck on the 35-69 Nationals past Tuesday’s deadline, “I was 20 and I was crying for two days. He’s very mature in everything he does.”\n\nNo, a loss even bigger than the great Soto is the totality of it all, the closing window of a group of superstars that will never be assembled in this fashion again.\n\nOnce in a lifetime\n\nThe stars that made a franchise bubbled up in 2009. Rizzo’s first major act as GM after taking over for the disgraced Jim Bowden following consecutive 100-loss seasons was to draft pitcher Stephen Strasburg No. 1. That was followed a year later by another grim season that enabled the drafting of Bryce Harper with the top pick.\n\nFor Nats fans wondering if their franchise has a curse about them, this is probably not talked about enough, but: No club has ever drafted superstars of this caliber as 1-1 picks in consecutive years. And thanks to the new collective bargaining agreement, it’s not likely to happen again.\n\nBy 2012, the Nationals won the first of four division championships. By 2014, Anthony Rendon was an All-Star caliber player. By 2015, Max Scherzer was in the fold. Trea Turner was acquired in trade from those Padres.\n\nCome 2019, all were World Series champs – save for Harper, replaced in the hearts of Nationals fans by Soto after he left as a free agent for a $330 million deal with the Phillies.\n\nThe schadenfreude was palpable: The occasionally insular Harper was rich and ringless, the joyous Soto and a merry band of vets were champions.\n\nInstead, a grim revolving door and an odd pattern of contract negotiations began.\n\nHarper had turned down $300 million from the Nats, we somehow learned. Through his end of things, we found out it was heavily deferred. Rendon, too, could not strike a long-term deal. He eventually left for the $245 million the club pegged to keep Strasburg, a fateful decision.\n\nTurner? It’s almost like the Nationals liked him until he got too good, until his shortstop rent district got closer to $300 million than $200 million.\n\nNow, they’re all gone, Turner packaged with Scherzer to the Dodgers after 2021 went sour. You don’t have to be the savviest fan to realize the Nationals faced choices on all these guys. Harper, Rendon and Scherzer received free agent deals worth a combined $705 million, with Scherzer receiving a record $43 million from the Mets.\n\nTurner will receive at least $200 million after this year, Soto perhaps north of $400 million after 2024. That’s nearly $1.5 billion in superstars, gone.\n\nYet you also need not be a banker nor a seamhead to know that letting all of them go – with Soto and his two-plus remaining years the final nail – is inexcusable.\n\nRizzo seems to know this, too.\n\n'I was the guy who signed him'\n\nOn what felt like a day of mourning in the clubhouse and manager’s office, along with the online community and in homes across the DMV suddenly stuffed with anachronistic shirseys, the GM struck a different tone. His hulking 2019 championship ring and commemorative polo said plenty, but he offered much more.\n\n“I wore this ring purposely, OK. It shows what we did in the past and what we’re going to do in the future,” he said, before evoking one of Martinez’s chestnuts from the 2019 run. “We’re in a bumpy road now. We believe coming out of this thing will be a beautiful place.”\n\nGotta be tough to be known as the GM that has to trade Juan Soto though, right?\n\n“I was the guy who signed him, too,” he replied, before noting that Soto, career OPS of .894, was fortunate to accompany him on the 2019 title run. “I’ll remember Juan as the guy who was with me when I won my first World Series as a general manager. And now I’m looking to do my next one.”\n\nBut what about fans with nary a star player to cheer on?\n\n“By the way,” he said, in case you wondered where those players come from, “kudos to the scouting and player development staff for running all those guys through here. We’ve had as good of impact players as anybody in the game. We’ve had stars here throughout our tenure. We had a 10-year run that was unmatched by few teams. We won four division titles, a wild card title, a National League pennant and a world championship.\n\n“You can count on one hand the number of teams that can match that success story the last 10 years and we’re equipped and capable and able to reboot it like we did before and have a 10-year run of success.”\n\nNow that we’re aware just how this club got built, it’s fair to wonder if past performance can predict future prospects. The haul from the Padres – outfielders Robert Hassell III and James Wood, major league-ready shortstop C.J. Abrams and pitcher MacKenzie Gore (he’s close) and Jarlin Susana (he’s 18 but promising) is strong. A talent evaluator for an American League club, seeking anonymity for competitive reasons, called it “VERY solid,” after watching many of them over multiple seasons.\n\nThe Nats’ trade hauls the past two years do, as Rizzo noted, position them with a potentially elite up-the-middle alignment, with catcher Keibert Ruiz, Abrams at short, Hassell in center and Luis Garcia at second. The contracts of pitching holdovers Strasburg and Patrick Corbin will saddle them for a couple more years, but shouldn’t prevent grander spending when necessary.\n\nIt’s just kind of wild that the club is starting over again, back on the downslope after a decade of winning revitalized a blah franchise and added billions of dollars to the Lerner family’s assets.\n\n“We transitioned from a nothing organization and team to a contender year in and year out,” says reliever Tyler Clippard, who joined the club from 2008-14 and returned this year. “I was proud to be part of that. It’s come full circle ... but it turned into a winning organization.”\n\nClippard was there for the brash Harper, debuting at 19, the reticent Rendon, was traded before Scherzer stomped on the scene and enjoyed a few weeks of Soto. Now, he and Doolittle, two injured relievers, along with the struggling Corbin and shelved Strasburg are the only recognizable players from a suddenly bygone era.\n\n“You’re talking about the talent coming through this locker room over the last 10 years with Harper and Stras and Soto – man,” says Clippard. “Those are all generational players that have come and gone. it’s not easy. It’s going to be tough for the fans.\n\n“But it’s up to us as players and an organization to give them something to root for.”\n\n'I'll never have to make that decision'\n\nThat won’t include Soto, who, Doolittle remembers, was a visibly different man on the day details of his contract offer leaked. Soto was not smiling. He was not hanging out with his teammates. He was, as Doolittle said, “carrying it around a bit.”\n\nSoto’s on-field swagger transitions to a more quiet fellow in the clubhouse. Now, he’d be caught up in a public-relations war, his team suddenly the injured party because he opted to pursue free agency in two years and not the $440 million offered.\n\nThe $29 million annual salary, though, would be $6 million less than the injured Rendon and Strasburg received three years ago. Players understand when others – particularly elite talents -are reluctant to sign contracts outdated by the time the ink’s dry.\n\n“Juan had such support of the guys in here that when we started talking about it we were like, ‘Yeah, I could see why he wouldn’t take it.’ He’s that good and that young,” says Doolittle, 35, who joined the club via trade in 2017, one year before Soto’s debut.\n\n“None of us could fathom being in that situation. And there were similar conversations in my time here where things came up with Harper and with Rendon. Where it was like, ‘I’ll never have to make that decision.’\n\n“But then you start thinking about it and you’re like, ‘I can see why. Hopefully, they work something out.’ I know it seemed for a day there that he felt uncomfortable with it being out there. But there was never a time guys in here felt differently about him.”\n\nRizzo says he wasn’t acting on an edict form ownership either current or future; the Lerners are expected to sell the team when a buyer emerges. Whether Rizzo’s regime is the one to see this rebuild through will be up to whichever group pays the estimated $2 billion necessary to buy the club.\n\nRizzo laid his resume on the table Tuesday. Soto has done that the past five seasons and chances are, the Nationals may not see another like him, or those who left before him.\n\n“It is a business. A big business. And when you’re trading a player like that, it’s never easy,” says Clippard. “You can argue that there really never will be a good trade for a player like that.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2022/03/24/davante-adams-asked-raiders-trade-well-before-packers-tagged-him/7154061001/", "title": "Davante Adams asked for Raiders trade well before Packers tagged ...", "text": "GREEN BAY, Wis. – There are good reasons the Green Bay Packers decided to trade Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders, even if it’s a bad idea to get rid of one of the best players in the NFL.\n\nAs much as the Packers wanted Adams back, they realized that the circumstances that had developed after the season would lead to a no-win battle of wills with one of the franchise’s classiest players.

And, hours before the drawing, hundreds of people waited in line to buy tickets at a \"lucky\" liquor store in Hawthorne, California.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the line for the lotto machine at the Des Plaines Speedway was so long that it snaked around the store, said Lisa Lepore, 61. Lepore said she works as a bus driver and regularly fuels up at the location, next to O'Hare International Airport.\n\nWhen she heard the news early Saturday, Lepore wondered if one of her coworkers had become rich overnight, she said.\n\n\"I hope that somebody who needs it really wins it because it would be a game-changer for them,\" she said.\n\nAs Lepore spoke, others trickled past the machine, sandwiched between the ice cream freezer on one side and the donut case and beef jerky stand on the other. Some scanned old tickets. Others purchased new ones. The small trash can on the ground overflowed with discarded paper strips and scratch-off cards.\n\nOther customers – many dawning airline uniforms – purchased milkshakes and cigarettes, and employees sold pizza and reloaded coffee machines.\n\nDon Barrett, 64, stopped at the Speedway while getting gas and slipped a bill into the lotto machine.\n\n\"I thought I'd try my luck,\" Barrett said. \"I didn't even know it was this location.

The odds of winning the largest prize in U.S. lottery history were 1 in 292.2 million.\n\n\"That just shows the total randomness of Powerball,\" Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery, told NBC News'Weekend Today on Sunday. \"At our peak last night, we were selling more than $1.2 million in Powerball tickets every single minute.\"\n\nRoughly speaking, the chances of picking the right combination of numbers is like flipping a coin and getting heads 28 times in a row, according to Jeffrey Miecznikowski, an associate professor of biostatistics at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\n“It’s very unlikely,” said Miecznikowski, who doesn't play Powerball himself.\n\nOdds are, you won't like this Powerball story\n\nThe odds of winning are so small that it’s hard to conceptualize it. A person is more likely to get struck by lightning or bitten by a shark, but Miecznikowski says most people don’t know someone personally who has had either of those things happen.\n\nPicking all the winners in the 64-team NCAA basketball tournament is harder — much harder — than guessing the right Powerball numbers, he said.\n\nIt would be about 1 billion times harder to pick all the winning teams randomly, Miecznikowski said. It would still be 500 times more difficult to fill out a bracket by allowing some strategy, such as knowing that a No. 16 seed hasn’t beaten a No. 1 seed, he said.\n\nSaturday's winning numbers were 16-19-32-34-57 and Powerball number 13. Miecznikowski speculated that one reason for no winner might be the Powerball number 13, which players who chose their own numbers might have avoided as unlucky.\n\nThe latest jackpot estimate of $1.3 billion would be twice as large as the previous biggest U.S. lottery prize from March 30, 2012, when Mega Millions paid $656 million for three tickets from Kansas, Illinois and Maryland. The total would also more than double the $590.5 million that Powerball paid May 18, 2013, for one ticket in Florida.\n\nWhile the $1.3 billion is by far the largest ever up for grabs in North America, Spain's latest elGordo lottery, or \"The Fat One,\" had a prize pool of $2.4 billion prize. But it was awarded to thousands of ticketholders, elGordo's website said. Powerball's riches could go to a single ticketholder.\n\nThe huge jackpot is creating an unforeseen advertising problem in several states: many electronic billboards promoting Powerball aren't configured to display billion-dollar prizes, since the phrase \"MILLION\" is affixed to the signs, the director of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency toldThe Baltimore Sun.\n\nThat issue might have seemed unimaginable last summer as Powerball sales declined due to competition from casinos and instant scratch-off games — as well as a phenomenon industry insiders call \"jackpot fatigue,\" in which players ignore lotteries until the prize grows astronomically.\n\nThe 10 biggest U.S. lottery jackpots\n\nIn October, Powerball officials tweaked the game's \"matrix,\" making it harder to win the grand prize, The Sun reported. The chances of winning the biggest prize shrank from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million. But the odds of winning any prize grew from 1 in 32 to 1 in 25.\n\nDespite the lack of an overall winner, Powerball's Saturday drawing still had nearly $160 million in smaller prizes. Among them were $2 million prizes for tickets sold in Connecticut and Texas. And $1 million tickets were sold in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.\n\nIn Arizona, two tickets paid out $1 million each, said the Arizona State Lottery. In addition to the two millionaires, there was one $150,000 and fifteen $50,000 winners in the state after Saturday night's drawing, The Arizona Republicreported.

Still, millions of Americans willingly spend their hard-earned money for a chance at an early retirement, lifelong financial security, and the extravagant lifestyle that a single lucky ticket could provide.\n\nAmericans spent a staggering $71.8 billion on lottery tickets in 2017 – or about $285 per adult. Of course, lottery ticket spending is not the same across all states, and in some parts of the country, Americans appear much more willing to spend in the hopes of hitting the jackpot.\n\nUsing data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 Annual Survey of State Government Finances, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed total lottery spending per person 18 and over to identify how much the average adult spends on the lottery in every state.\n\nPopulation figures and income data came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community survey. Per capita spending on the lottery ranges by state, from as little as $45 to as much nearly $927. Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, and Utah did not permit the sale of lottery tickets in 2017, the most recent year for which ticket sale data is available.\n\nAccording to a 2016 Gallup poll, higher-income Americans are more likely to play the lottery than those on the lower end of the income spectrum. In keeping with that finding, the majority of states with greater lottery spending per adult also have higher than average median household incomes. Here is a look at America’s richest and poorest states.\n\nFor a number of state governments, the lottery is an important source of revenue. States collect far more in lottery ticket sales than they pay out to winners. After accounting for prize money and administrative costs, proceeds from state lotteries often total in the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars. Still, most states get the largest portion of their annual revenue from either income or sales taxes.

M. Hess and Michael B. Sauter, 24/7 Wall St.\n\nStates paid out more than %2442 billion in prize money in 2012\n\n2012 payouts included a %24587 million Powerball jackpot\n\nWho benefits from lottery sales varies widely from state to state\n\nState governments pay out an enormous amount of money each year to lotto jackpot winners. More than $42 billion in prize money was paid out in 2012, including a $587 million Powerball jackpot late in the year. Using data provided by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL), 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the biggest lottery payouts last year.\n\nWith the exception of two states, all those in the top 10 have the biggest populations and lottery sales of all 50 states. The two most populous states, Texas and California, have the fifth and sixth highest payouts, respectively.\n\nThere are other factors that can determine whether a state ranks in the top 10 biggest payout states. Powerball jackpots, in which a number of states band together for an over-sized payout, have helped spur sales in unlikely states.\n\nOn the profit front, state lotteries netted $18.7 billion in 2012, up from $16.7 billion in 2009. David Gale, NASPL executive directer, says some state lotteries are earning more because they have increased the variety of games they offer, especially instant-win games.\n\nThe overall increase in lottery sales has benefited many government programs. Most states' lottery commissions funnel profits to education — particularly for kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) public school programs. Many states, such as New York and California, direct 100% of the profits to education. There are exceptions, however. Some states, such as Rhode Island, place the money raised by lottery ticket sales in the general fund to be used at the state's discretion. Proceeds are also used to help support veterans, senior citizens, and conservation programs.\n\nBased on NASPL figures, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the largest lottery jackpots. We looked at sales, payouts and state profit for the state lottery for the past five fiscal years, in addition to where the profits were allocated. In addition, we also looked at sales among the variety of games available, such as instant-win games, Powerball, Mega Millions and Video Lottery Terminal (VLT). In two states — Rhode Island and Oregon — total annual sales exclude VLT. However, total payout and profit for all states, including Rhode Island and Oregon, included VLT sales.\n\n10. Ohio\n\nPrizes paid: $1.7 billion\n\nTicket sales: $2.8 billion\n\nState profit: $771 million\n\nGovernment use: Education\n\nThe Ohio Lottery Commission has been selling tickets since 1974. It has provided more than $17 billion to education initiatives since then. In fiscal 2012, the lottery's proceeds to education exceeded $700 million for the fourth straight year. The commission paid out just over $1 billion in prizes, the majority to instant winnings game players. The state has recently had massive payouts in Mega Millions, with a $162 million winner in 2003, and Powerball, with a $261 million jackpot in 2010.\n\n9. Oregon\n\nPrizes paid: $2 billion\n\nTicket sales: $322 million (excluding. VLT sales)\n\nState profit from sales: $527 million\n\nGovernment use: Education, parks, economic development\n\nOregon is one of a handful of states that have state-sponsored video lotteries. The vast majority of the state's prizes are paid out to VLT players. Despite the use of VLTs, Oregon lottery profits have leveled off in recent years. In fiscal 2008, the state was able to generate $680 million in profits; in fiscal 2012, that number had declined to $527 million. Currently, 59% of Oregon lottery profits help fund K-12 education, state parks and economic development.\n\n8. Pennsylvania\n\nPrizes paid: $2.2 billion\n\nTicket sales: $3.5 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $1.1 billion\n\nGovernment use: Senior citizens\n\nSince it first began selling tickets in 1972, the Pennsylvania lottery has contributed more than $22 billion to state programs. In fiscal 2012, the state transferred more than $1 billion to different programs that benefit older residents, including providing low-cost prescription drugs, funding senior centers and long-term living services. The state had the seventh-highest lottery sales of all 50 states. It ranked third in Powerball sales, at over $277 million, and ranked third in Powerball profits, at $139.2 million. In April 2012, a group of state workers shared a $107.5 million Powerball jackpot.\n\n7. Georgia\n\nPrizes paid: $2.3 billion\n\nTicket sales: $3.8 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $901 million\n\nGovernment use: Scholarships, pre-K\n\nThe state's lottery generated more than $3.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2012, more than all but five other states. Of that revenue, about two-thirds came from instant-win games. During any given period, the Georgia lottery offers between 40 and 45 instant-ticket games and nine online games. Established in 1992, Georgia's lottery has generated more than $14 billion for education programs. In 2012, the lottery was able to transfer more than $600 million to HOPE Scholarships, which provided financial assistance for high-performing students that attend Georgia public schools. Another $300 million was directed to the state's pre-kindergarten program.\n\n6. California\n\nPrizes paid: $2.6 billion\n\nTicket sales: $4.4 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $1.3 billion\n\nGovernment use: Education\n\nThe California lottery was created by a ballot measure in 1984. Since then, it has been used to raise funds for education. The lottery has generated over $1 billion in profit for California in every year since 2008. In 2012, California sold more Mega Millions tickets, at $720 million, and paid out more prizes from the multi-state game, at $351 million, than other states. A great deal of total state lottery revenue went to the programs it benefits, rather than to players in the form of prizes. the state ranked third in paying beneficiaries and sixth in total prizes to winners. All profits from the state's lottery system is directed to education, benefiting K-12 schools as well as higher education.\n\n5.Texas\n\nPrizes paid: $2.6 billion\n\nTicket sales: $4.2 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $1.2 billion\n\nGovernment use: Education, general fund\n\nWith its first ticket sold in 1992, the Texas lottery has quickly expanded to become the fifth-largest system in the country, grossing more than $4 billion in sales in fiscal 2012. On Feb. 5, 2010, a Texas resident won the biggest payout ever awarded by the state lottery commission, $144 million in a Mega Millions drawing. Before 1997, proceeds from the lottery were placed into the state's general fund. Since then, however, the majority of funds raised by the Texas lottery go to the state's foundation school fund — used to support school districts. The fund has received over $15 billion since 1997.\n\n4. Florida\n\nPrizes paid: $2.8 billion\n\nTicket sales: $4.5 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $1.3 billion\n\nGovernment use: Education\n\nThe Florida Lottery first began selling tickets in January 1988. Since then, it has raised more than $24 billion and made 1,200 players millionaires. In fiscal 2012, the Florida lottery paid out $2.8 billion in prizes, while transferring more than $1.3 billion to its education enhancement trust fund. These proceeds help the state fund its college scholarships program, as well as fund school construction, repair and renovation projects statewide. In fiscal 2012, the state led all 50 states in Powerball ticket sales, at just over $500 million, and winnings, at just above $230 million.\n\n3. Rhode Island\n\nPrizes paid: $2.91 billion\n\nTicket sales: $250 million (excluding VLT sales)\n\nState profit from sales: $378 million\n\nGovernment use: General fund\n\nRhode Island is one of a few states that allow residents to play on VLTs. In addition, charitable organizations have the option to participate in a Million Dollar Raffle and pull-tab games not available to the general public. Rhode Island is among a minority of states that don't funnel lottery profits directly to education. All the profits of the state's lottery are placed in the state's general operating fund. In fiscal 2012, the state paid out $2.9 billion in prizes, the vast majority of which went to VLT players.\n\n2. Massachusetts\n\nPrizes paid: $3.4 billion\n\nTicket sales: $4.7 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $834 million\n\nGovernment use: Cities and towns\n\nThe Massachusetts lottery has sold over $90 billion in tickets in the past 40 years, with more than $4.7 billion in tickets sold in fiscal 2012. The proceeds are predominantly returned as aid to the state's towns, with the state distributing $833.9 million to localities last year. The state generated most of its revenue from local, rather than multi-state games. Massachusetts' Powerball and Mega Millions sales ranked 19th and 12th, respectively, among all states. However, given the state's small size, it is surprising that the state has had several major winners, including a $294 million Mega Millions winner in 2004.\n\n1. New York\n\nPrizes paid: $4.1 billion\n\nTicket sales: $8.4 billion\n\nState profit from sales: $2.9 billion\n\nGovernment use: Education\n\nThe New York lottery made a profit of nearly $2.9 billion in 2012, more than double the profits of the second-most profitable state lottery system. This was, however, less than the fiscal 2011 profit of more than $3 billion. Although the instant-win games sold more than any other game, the video lottery sold over $1.4 billion, far more than any other state that offers VLTs. Lottery proceeds go toward funding public education. Since the lottery's founding in 1966, more than $45 billion in profits were transferred to public schools.\n\nWeigley, Hess and Sauter are writer for 24/7 Wall St.com, a financial news and commentary website.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2016/01/14/powerball-thursday/78779006/", "title": "Winners in 3 states to split record $1.6B Powerball jackpot", "text": "Doug Stanglin and Jessica Estepa\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Powerball lightning bolt finally struck. Lucky ticket holders in three states — California, Florida and Tennessee — will split the record $1.6 billion Powerball jackpot that lured millions of lottery hopefuls into a frenzied buying spree.\n\nThe winners beat the 1-in-292.2 million odds by picking the magic combination: 4, 8, 19, 27, 34 and Powerball 10.\n\nThe winners can opt for annual payments over decades or an immediate lump sum.\n\nNo one has stepped forward yet to claim a share, but everyone now knows where the winning tickets were sold: A 7-Eleven in Chino Hills, Calif.; Naifeh's Food Mart in Munford, Tenn.; and a Publix grocery in Melbourne Beach, Fla.\n\nEven though the big prize winners haven't stepped forward publicly, lottery officials were already cutting checks for the retailers that sold the jackpot-winning ticket.\n\nNaifeh's Food Mart in Munford, a city of about 6,000 people located 30 miles north of Memphis, was set to get a $25,000 check Thursday afternoon. The store is owned by the brother and nephew of former Tennessee House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh.\n\nWhen word spread that a winning ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven in Chino Hills, hundreds of people who won't get a dime basked in the glory anyway, many taking selfies with the store clerk on duty because, well, why not?\n\n“I’m very proud that the ticket was sold here,” the clerk, M. Faroqui, told local newspaper the San Bernardino Sun. “I’m very happy. This is very exciting.”\n\nStore owner Balbir Atwal, noting his lotto machine, called it the “luckiest place in all the planet.”\n\n“I’m very excited and happy,” he told the Sun. “My community has helped me so much, I’m so grateful to them. I don’t know how much I’m getting but I’ll be helping my employees and my family and community.”\n\nMany locals stood around to cheer and mug for TV cameras that descended on the suburban community of 77,000 residents located about 35 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\n“It’s history. We’re all so excited for our city,” said Rita Talwar, 52, who has lived in Chino Hills for 30 years.\n\nIn Florida, the winning ticket was sold at a Publix grocery in Melbourne Beach. An employee told Florida Today the store has been inundated with phone calls.\n\nJohn Koontz, a front service worker at the store, had just stepped out of his car to show up for work when someone he knew asked him the big question: Was it true?\n\n“They’re all excited. One of the locals just asked me was it true that the winning ticket was sold here,” Koontz said, lining up one of the store scooters in the cart area. “Can you imagine this is happening here at our little store?”\n\nDave Demi didn't win the Powerball but said he's happy about the possibility someone from Melbourne Beach may have.\n\n\"I'd say good for you,\" Demi said, braving the early morning chill to walk into the Driftwood Plaza Publix to check his ticket for other possible winnings. \"I bought two tickets here and two at a convenience store. I did the one Powerball number,\" he said chuckling.\n\nOthers were also excited. One worker was overheard saying to another, \"it happened here.\"\n\nIn addition to the winning ticket, the California Lottery said 12 tickets matching five of the six Powerball numbers were sold for Wednesday's drawing. Those winners will get a $1 million prize.\n\nContributing: J.D.

With the exception of March, monthly scratch ticket sales in 2020 exceeded ’19 results, often by tens of millions of dollars.\n\nLottery thrived while casinos closed\n\nThe lottery commission, which operates on the state fiscal year that ends in June, compiled the calendar-year totals at the request of The Dispatch to gauge how the pandemic affected ticket sales.\n\nScratch-ticket sales drove record numbers for the lottery in the first half of 2020, said lottery spokeswoman Danielle Frizzi-Babb, and that appears to have continued during the second half.\n\n“People have been limited in their entertainment options for the last ten months, and lottery games proved to be a fun socially distanced form of entertainment,” state lottery Director Pat McDonald added in a released statement.\n\nThe totals were a bright spot in Ohio’s legalized gaming sector, with restrictions on in-person activities hampering casino and racino revenues.\n\nThe Ohio Casino Control Commission reported total 2020 revenues of more than $643 million, down about 24% from nearly $851 million in 1999.\n\nThe 2020 totals included two months (April and May) with zero casino revenue, following closures from mid-March through mid-June instituted by the state health department to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As of November, casinos also were barred from operating around the clock, due to curfews implemented as part of the state pandemic response.\n\nCasino, lottery revenues rebounded\n\nCasino revenues hit record totals during the six months when locations were open and operating 24 hours a day, commission spokeswoman Jessica Franks said.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s pent-up demand...,” she said. “Movie theaters have been closed, and a lot of other entertainment options have not been available for folks. So, this has been one of those few entertainment options that people still have where they’ve been able to go out, if they choose to do so.”\n\nLikewise, video lottery terminals regulated by the state lottery commission at seven Ohio horse racing tracks recorded a 35% drop in the total number of credits played in 2020, to $7.8 billion from $12 billion-plus.\n\nBut, while traditional lottery sales statewide were down in March and April, monthly sales for the rest of 2020 exceeded 2019. McDonald said the lottery commission and retailers found ways to promote ticket sales despite restrictions on face-to-face interactions.\n\nIn May, for example, the lottery launched a mobile feature allowing cash prizes to be claimed online and deposited directly into accounts.\n\nAnd, while unpredictable, bigger jackpots, like those in recent days for Powerball and Mega Millions drawings, often push new or casual players to purchase tickets.\n\n“These past few weeks have shown gains in almost every category, but especially in our Scratch-Off, Pick game and Keno product lines,” McDonald said.\n\nState schools fund should benefit from lotto gains\n\nOf the total revenues from traditional lottery sales and racino machines, about 65% is distributed as prizes, one-quarter goes to school funding, 6-7% is paid out in commissions to retailers, and 4% is used to fund lottery commissioner operations, said Frizzi-Babb.\n\nDuring the last fiscal year, $1.3 billion in proceeds was deposited into the state’s Lottery Profits Education Fund.\n\nOf the total casino revenues, 51% is distributed to counties on a per-capita basis, and 34% goes to public school districts based on enrollment. Both payouts will be lower for the first six months of current fiscal year.\n\nmkovac@dispatch.com\n\n@OhioCapitalBlog", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/22"}]}

It doesn’t make any sense to us,” Sgt. Spencer Cannon, Utah County Sheriff spokesperson, told USA TODAY. “But that’s what he told us, and we’ve got no reason to believe he’s making that up.”\n\nThe 26-year-old man was booked on a misdemeanor reckless burning charge, and charges related to possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, Cannon said.\n\nThe local fire department was called at about 4:45 p.m. and arrived within minutes. When Springville Fire Chief Henry Clinton arrived on scene and was accompanied by Springville Police Chief Lance Haight when they saw a vehicle and man walking about with his dog on an access road high up on the mountainside.\n\n“So really we went up there really to save his life,” Clinton told USA TODAY. “We weren’t thinking he lit the fire. And then as we approached, we had to stop because he was blocking the road. We got out, and he just offered: ‘There was a spider!’...It didn’t make any sense to me…So I just looked at him and said ‘What spider?’“.\n\n'Save the life of the river':House passes bills on Colorado River drought, wildfires\n\nCalifornia fire:Rain aids in fight against massive McKinney Fire; storms could spark new flames\n\nAs Clinton left to address the fire, the man confessed to Haight that he was trying to light a spider on fire. Then police arrested him.\n\nClinton said roughly 100 firefighters from five different departments moved quickly and aggressively to stop the rapid moving fire and prevent it from reaching a row of homes downhill. An air tanker dropped retardant on the flames.\n\nFire crews began to pull back at about 9:00 p.m. as lightning began to strike nearby. Then heavy rain fell on the area, and the fire was out by the morning, according to Clinton.\n\nFire officials said online on Tuesday morning that the fire area grew to 60 acres, and was 10% contained, which refers to how much of the fire’s perimeter has been surrounded by firefighters. Officials said containment was expected to \"drastically increase\" by the end of firefighters' shift, Utah Fire said.\n\n“Everybody did an outstanding job. No injuries to speak of, just some scratches,” Clinton said. “Everybody left in good shape.”\n\nPeople facing fire-related charges can be held accountable for the expenses involved in fighting the fire, according to Cannon.\n\n“I was talking to two of the police chiefs that were there last night and they estimated that the cost of this fire is probably going to be well over $200,000,” Cannon said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/springville-fire-man-arrested-spider", "title": "A Utah man arrested for starting a wildfire told authorities he was ...", "text": "(CNN) A 26-year-old man who was arrested for starting a wildfire told Utah authorities he had been attempting to kill a spider with a lighter when he started the blaze, according to the Utah County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDeputies responded Monday to the Bonneville Shoreline area near Springville for a fire that was quickly spreading up a mountain, according to a probable cause statement from the sheriff's office.\n\nWhen they arrived, fire personnel informed them they had encountered a man who told them he had started the fire, according to the statement.

The inability of Democrats in Washington, despite narrow majorities in Congress and President Joe Biden in the White House, to come up with the votes to pass federal legislation guaranteeing abortion rights -- and the likelihood that, even if they were to retain or build on those majorities, action would be difficult -- has positioned Democratic state leaders as the last line of defense against Republican efforts to seize on the court's potential decision and move forward r seeking either to ban or severely restrict the right to an abortion.\n\n\"With gridlock in Washington at an all-time high, the battle to protect reproductive health care will be fought in the states and won by Democratic governors,\" said Wendi Wallace, deputy executive director of the Democratic Governors Association. \"This draft opinion should serve as a wake-up call to anyone not paying attention to what's at stake in governors' races this November.\"\n\nThe top spokesman for the Democratic Attorneys General Association made a similar argument -- and implored Democrats to consider the shifting terrain as they decide where to direct their election season contributions.\n\n\"If Roe is overturned, this fight will move squarely into the states,\" said Geoff Burgan, DAGA's communications director, \"and we need national donors, both large and small, to recognize that reality and invest in electing Democratic AGs this year.\"\n\nWhile Democrats at the state level quickly moved to underscore the stakes and, pointedly, what they planned to do if elected or reelected to their positions, Democratic campaign organizations on the federal level have struggled to articulate their plans going forward.\n\nIn a statement late Monday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said that reports of the Supreme Court draft opinion, which has since been confirmed as authentic by Chief Justice John Roberts, had \"dramatically escalated the stakes of the 2022 election\" and that protecting and expanding the Democratic Senate majority would be key to maintaining \"the power to confirm or reject Supreme Court justices.\"\n\nBut even as the Senate Democratic group warned that Republicans were prepared to move forward with \"federal legislation to outlaw abortion after six weeks of pregnancy,\" the DSCC offered no promise that even a new and larger Democratic majority would even attempt to legalize abortion on the national level -- a reality underscored on Tuesday by Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, both of whom reiterated their unwillingness to consider scrapping the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote threshold that effectively gives Republicans a veto on most legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign arm, implored Democrats to vote in the fall.\n\n\"Democrats: We're angry and hurt, I know. But it's not about filibuster, size of the court or what the Senate hasn't passed. It's about Republicans, not us,\" New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the DCCC chair, tweeted Tuesday morning . \"We can save our freedoms. But, it's November, stupid.\"\n\nHouse Democrats voted 218-211 in September to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, with one Democrat, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar -- who has DCCC support in his primary against a pro-abortion rights challenger -- voting no. No Republican backed the legislation. In the Senate, the bill fell well short of cracking the filibuster, with Manchin joining Republicans in opposition.\n\nOn Tuesday, after Biden condemned the draft opinion, White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated the President's past calls for Congress to act but also stated what has become obvious to many Democrats and abortion rights advocates.\n\n\"There has been a vote on the Women's Health Protection Act,\" she said, \"which would do exactly that, and there were not even enough votes, even if there was no filibuster, to get that done.\"\n\nDemocrats look local in search for message that sticks\n\nJanuary CNN poll on abortion and overturning Roe v. Wade showed a majority of Americans opposed to an abortion ban, with only 30% saying they wanted the Supreme Court to gut the decision. Most, 52%, said that in the event Roe was overturned, they would want their states to become a safe haven for women seeking abortion.\n\nBut capitalizing on those sentiments has traditionally been difficult for Democratic candidates.\n\nDemocratic firm Slingshot Strategies recently tested messaging on the issue in a pair of swing congressional districts -- Virginia's 2nd and Michigan's 7th, which are currently held by Democratic Reps. Elaine Luria and Elissa Slotkin, respectively. The polling found that abortion issues were a \"powerful motivator\" across the board and that those passions would escalate if the high court struck down Roe -- large majorities in both districts were supportive of the 1973 decision.\n\nFinding a political message that both motivated and persuaded voters to support Democrats in the districts, though, was more complicated. The polling ultimately found that immediately and consistently casting in local terms what would be an unpopular decision by the high court -- while eschewing more familiar national talking points -- was Democrats' best bet.\n\n\"Successful Democratic messaging focuses on state-specific changes that could impose new government restrictions on abortion where voters live, with the incumbent Democratic Congresspeople as messengers rather than national Democrats,\" said Evan Roth Smith, Slingshot's pollster and co-founder.\n\nUnlike their federal counterparts, Democratic statewide officials and candidates across the country responded to the news by flexing the immediate and tangible power their offices have in the fight over abortion.\n\n\"As long as I am governor, Nevada will continue to champion reproductive freedom,\" said Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who is up for reelection this year.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is making her second gubernatorial bid, said that as governor, she would \"defend the right to an abortion and fight for reproductive justice.\"\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is running unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor in a state where Republicans control both legislative chambers, said: \"Given the dynamics in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the next governor is going to have a bill on their desk that will restrict or outlaw abortion rights and they will have a decision to sign it or veto it.\"\n\n\"I will, of course, veto it,\" he said.\n\nShapiro went on to condemn Washington's \"inability to codify Roe over many years\" and said Pennsylvania Democrats \"cannot afford to lose\" the veto power currently held by term-limited Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.\n\n\"In the absence of DC acting,\" Shapiro said. \"I am prepared to lead.\"\n\nA similar dynamic -- with the GOP poised to act in legislatures they control -- holds in Wisconsin and Michigan, where the respective Democratic governors, Tony Evers and Gretchen Whitmer, are vying for second terms this fall.\n\nMichigan Democrats' unique challenge\n\nIn Michigan, a fierce state-level fight over abortion rights is already underway, as statewide-elected Democrats up for reelection this year seek to use their power to protect the state's 27 abortion providers in 13 counties.\n\nIf Roe v. Wade is repealed, a 1931 Michigan law would snap back into place, one that makes performing or undergoing an abortion a felony in almost all cases -- including rape and incest -- with an exception only to save the life of the mother. Republicans control the state legislature, making a repeal of that law unlikely.\n\nWhitmer in April sued the prosecutors in the 13 counties with abortion providers, asking the Michigan Supreme Court to determine that the state's Constitution protects abortion rights and to block those prosecutors from enforcing the 1931 law.\n\nWhitmer's chances of victory in court are improved by the 2020 victories of two Democratic-backed state Supreme Court candidates, giving liberals a majority on the bench.\n\n\"To the nearly 2.2 million women in Michigan whose access to abortion hangs in the balance, I promise you this: I will fight like hell to make sure abortion remains safe, legal, and accessible in our state,\" Whitmer said on Twitter after Politico's report.\n\nMichigan's Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel -- who has discussed her own abortion when she was pregnant with triplets in 2002 and doctors told her she would miscarry all three unless she terminated one -- is refusing to defend the 1931 law in court and has said she will not enforce it.\n\nNessel's opponent, Republican Matt DePerno, has said he does not support abortion rights under any circumstances and, citing Politico's report, said the draft ruling \"will be such a great win for the unborn and for states' rights.\"\n\nDemocrats playing from behind in the states\n\nAbortion being thrown back to the states would put Democrats' struggle to win state legislatures into stark relief. For years, Republicans have heavily invested in down-ballot races, in part, to control these state chambers in a post-Roe v. Wade world. By doing so, lawmakers in 13 states -- including Texas, Tennessee and Missouri -- have already passed so-called trigger laws, by which bans would go into effect if Roe is overturned.\n\nDemocrats have not kept pace in the fight for state legislatures, instead focusing the bulk of the party's energy and money on federal races. In the eight years that former President Barack Obama was in office, the party lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats, according to counts of legislative losses. But even with some recent renewed interest, Democrats have not been able to meaningfully reverse those GOP gains.\n\n\"The state that you live in shouldn't dictate fundamental American freedoms, like the right to bodily autonomy. But if this opinion comes down gutting Roe, that is where we are now,\" Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Jessica Post said late Monday. \"The fight is in the states.\"\n\nIn 2020, Democrats hoped that an increased investment and focus on legislative races would result in wins across the country. Instead, the only chambers that flipped were in the Republican direction -- and although the DLCC raised more than $50 million in their fight to win down-ballot races, the figure paled in comparison with money that went to long-shot Senate contests . The party won its US Senate majority with a pair of runoff victories in Georgia in January 2021, but suffered heavy defeats, despite taking in lordly sums of campaign donations, in GOP stronghold states such as Kentucky and South Carolina.\n\n\"This should be a tough lesson for Democrats,\" Post said. \"Our policymaking power in Washington is limited and the fight to protect abortion rights will now lie in state legislatures.\"\n\nThis has been most evident this year, when Republican-controlled legislatures across the country have, in anticipation of a possible ruling on Roe, positioned themselves to pass strict abortion laws as quickly as possible. Much of this happened in places where Democrats could do little. In one week alone this year, Republicans in four states -- Kentucky, Florida, Oklahoma and Tennessee -- passed laws to curtail abortion access that were most similar to the Mississippi 15-week abortion ban that is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe power of Democratic governors has also been on display, for example in Kansas, where Gov. Laura Kelly -- who is also up for reelection in November -- has stood in the way of several attempts by the Republican-controlled legislature to pass strict abortion laws in the red state.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kelly made clear she would continue to use her office to impede those attempts, saying that she has \"always believed that every woman's reproductive decisions should be left to her and her physician\" and that she will \"continue to oppose all regressive legislation which interferes with individual rights or freedoms.\"\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg", "Dan Merica", "Eric Bradner"], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/us/state-abortion-trigger-laws-roe-v-wade-overturned/index.html", "title": "13 states have passed so-called 'trigger laws,' bans designed to go ...", "text": "(CNN) Many Americans anxiously anticipating the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade may have been offered a glimpse of what's to come when Politico revealed a draft Supreme Court opinion Monday night that would upend the landmark abortion rights case.\n\nThough the unearthing of the draft has no immediate effect on abortion access, the preliminary opinion, which was confirmed to be authentic by the court, would overturn Roe v. Wade if a majority of justices decided to join, leaving state legislators to weigh their own abortion policies.\n\nThe 1973 Roe v. Wade court decision affirmed the right to receive an abortion under the 14th Amendment, ruling that abortions were constitutionally protected up until about 23 weeks when a fetus could be able to live outside the womb.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, setting the court up to examine decades of precedent set by Roe. Some state legislatures have enacted policies to increase abortion access, including in California, which passed a law in March to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for abortion services covered by health plans, and in Colorado, where Democratic lawmakers codified the right to receive an abortion in the state.\n\nBut many Republican-led state legislatures have already moved to limit abortion access and others are poised to enforce restrictive laws that have remained unenforced since Roe was passed. In total, an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute finds that 23 states have laws aiming to limit abortion access, including some states that have multiple provisions in place.\n\nStates including Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia had abortion restrictions before the Roe ruling that have never been removed. Others have approved near-total bans or laws prohibiting abortion after a certain number of weeks -- but many of them have been blocked by courts, including those in Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina.\n\nLegislators in 13 states have passed so-called \"trigger laws,\" which are bans designed to go into effect if Roe is overturned. In some cases, the law requires an official such as an attorney general to certify that Roe has been struck down before the law can take effect.\n\nThese are the states with \"trigger laws\" poised to go into effect almost immediately if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas has a law on the books that would ban nearly all abortions in the event that Roe is overturned, except for in the case of a life-threatening medical emergency. A medical provider who violates the law could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $100,000 or both.\n\nLast year, a federal judge blocked another bill passed by state legislators which aimed to block nearly all abortions and made no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho's trigger ban would make providing abortions a felony punishable by up to five years in prison if Roe is struck down. Exceptions are provided to prevent the death of the pregnant person or in the case of rape or incest.\n\nIn March, Idaho legislators passed a separate bill modeled after Texas' restrictive law, which prohibits abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can happen as early as six weeks. The law also allows family members of the fetus to sue the medical provider who performed the procedure.\n\nThe ban was temporarily blocked by the state Supreme Court last month after abortion providers challenged it in a lawsuit.\n\nKentucky\n\nKentucky's legislature passed a bill in 2019 which would ban abortions and make performing them a felony offense if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Very limited exceptions would be provided to prevent the death or serious injury of the person giving birth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana has a law in place that would ban a medical provider from performing an abortion procedure or providing drugs intended to induce an abortion in the case that Roe is overturned. The ban would not apply to life-threatening or serious medical emergencies, but requires the physician makes \"reasonable medical efforts\" to preserve the life of the adult and the fetus.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi law states that within 10 days of the state attorney general confirming Roe has been overturned, abortions are prohibited in the state. Limited exceptions are provided in cases of rape or when the procedure would preserve the mother's life.\n\nMississippi passed a separate 15-week abortion ban in 2018, which is the source of the case currently in front of the Supreme Court . The court is expected to announce its decision in June, but a draft opinion revealed by Politico suggests a majority of the justices may be poised to strike down Roe.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri approved a law in 2019 that would make it a felony for medical providers to perform or induce an abortion except in cases of medical emergencies if Roe is struck down.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nA law approved by the North Dakota legislature in 2007 would ban abortion and make it a felony to perform the procedure except in cases when it would save the life of the mother. The law would go into effect \"as a result of new decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States\" that would make the provision constitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill last month that would make performing abortions illegal in the state, only allowing exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person. The measure makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both.\n\nsecond bill signed into law last week sets a timeline for provisions to go into effect, depending on how the Supreme Court rules.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nwould make it illegal to perform an abortion except in life-threatening medical emergencies and would become effective \"on the date states are recognized by the United States Supreme Court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy.\" South Dakota has had a trigger ban on the books since 2005, when a law was passed to set up an almost outright ban on abortions in the event that Roe is overturned. The law would make it illegal to perform an abortion except in life-threatening medical emergencies and would become effective \"on the date states are recognized by the United States Supreme Court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy.\"\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee law contains a provision that would prohibit all abortions except those that would prevent the death of the mother and would go into effect 30 days after Roe is struck down. Medical providers could be charged with a felony for violating the law.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas' so-called trigger ban was signed into law in June 2021 and would make abortions illegal unless the pregnant person's life is threatened or they are at risk of serious injury. The law would go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a judgment overruling Roe.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah passed a law in May 2020 banning almost all abortions if Roe is overturned. Exceptions include cases of rape or incest, detection of severe birth defects, or prevention of the death or serious injury of the person giving birth. Performing an abortion in violation of the law is a second-degree felony.\n\nWyoming", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/politics/senate-abortion-rights-vote-roe-v-wade/index.html", "title": "Roe v.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia, joining with Republicans to vote against the measure and stop it from advancing.\n\nThe bill's failure to advance was expected amid GOP resistance. But the outcome of the vote nevertheless underscores how Democrats are severely limited in what they can achieve with their narrow Senate majority.\n\nAt the same time, the party faces enormous pressure to take action on abortion rights amid fears that Roe v. Wade will soon be struck down. Holding the vote provided an opportunity for Democrats to spotlight the issue and criticize Republican resistance to passage of the legislation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden lashed out at Senate Republicans after the failed Senate vote.\n\n\"Once again -- as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court -- Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care,\" Biden said in a statement. \"This failure to act comes at a time when women's constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack -- and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people.\"\n\nBut the vote also highlighted division over the contentious issue among Democrats. Manchin told CNN ahead of Wednesday's vote he would be a \"no\" on the Democratic bill, arguing it's too broad. He indicated he would support a codification of Roe v. Wade, but said this bill goes too far. The moderate Democrat, who represents the red state of West Virginia and has previously described himself as \"pro-life and proud of it,\" also voted with Republicans in opposition to the bill when it came before the Senate in February.\n\nThe Senate took up a version of the Women's Health Protection Act sponsored by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. The bill would codify the right to access abortion into federal law and guarantee the right of health care providers to perform abortion services. A House-passed version of the bill failed to advance in the Senate earlier this year amid GOP opposition.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the vote one of the \"most important\" senators will take, \"not only this session, but in this century.\"\n\n\"This is not an abstract exercise, it's as real and as urgent as it gets,\" Schumer said at a news conference on Friday.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted Democrats for forcing the vote, arguing that \"it would attack Americans' conscience rights and religious freedoms.\"\n\n\"It would overturn modest and overwhelmingly popular safeguards like waiting periods, informed consent laws and possibly even parental notification,\" McConnell said of Democrats' bill in remarks on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nSens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, rare Republican abortion-rights supporters, have introduced their own legislation to codify the rights established by Roe into federal law.\n\nBoth voted against the Women's Health Protection Act in February and voted against it again during Wednesday's vote. Collins criticized the Democratic bill in a statement ahead of the vote. The Maine Republican said the bill \"explicitly invalidates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in connection with abortion and supersedes other longstanding, bipartisan conscience laws.\"\n\nAsked at a news conference on Friday why he won't instead bring the Collins and Murkowski bill to the floor, which could receive bipartisan support, Schumer said, \"We are not looking to compromise something as vital as this.\"\n\nEarlier this week, more than a dozen abortion rights groups wrote a letter strongly opposing Murkowski and Collins' bill, arguing it \"would not protect the right to abortion if Roe v. Wade is overruled.\"\n\nDemocrats have sounded the alarm and reacted with outrage in response to a recently leaked Supreme Court draft opinion revealing plans to strike down Roe v. Wade after roughly five decades.\n\nRepublicans, despite many opposing abortion rights, have focused their response instead on the bombshell leak of the Supreme Court opinion, arguing that the leak itself represents a significant threat to judicial independence and freedom from outside interference.\n\nWhile the Senate vote on Wednesday had been expected to fail, many Democrats still argued that the political landscape has shifted now that it has become evident Roe v. Wade may soon be struck down and that it is imperative to put lawmakers on the record over the issue.\n\n\"I do think that the vote is necessary,\" Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, said. \"There has been time since (the bill) failed in the Senate the last time for people to have more conversations, more outreach. And then when this news of the leak, the draft opinion, when that became public, for a lot of work, a lot of conversations, a lot of advocacy groups reaching out, a lot more information stirring in people's communities to open up a conversation where people could have a mind change.\"\n\nPrior to the vote starting, about two dozen House progressive members came over from the House side and were chanting \"my body, my decision\" near Schumer's office.

The opinion in this case is not expected to be published until late June.\n\nThe court confirmed the authenticity of the document Tuesday. It also stressed it was not the final decision.\n\nAccording to the draft, the court would overturn Roe v. Wade's holding of a federal constitutional right to an abortion. The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women's reproductive health in America.\n\nIt appears that five justices would be voting to overturn Roe. Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe v. Wade, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito's draft opinion, sources tell CNN, likely with the court's three liberals.\n\nThat would mean that the five conservative justices that would make up the majority overturning Roe are Alito and Justices Clarence Thomas , Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nJUST WATCHED Coates describes potential socioeconomic impact if Roe v.

Under current law, government cannot interfere with a women's choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.\n\n\"This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,\" Roberts said. I have directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.\"\n\n\"To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,\" Roberts said. \"The work of the Court will not be affected in any way. We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce -- permanent employees and law clerks alike -- intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court.\"\n\nAfter the draft was published, a crowd gathered outside the Supreme Court building Monday evening, as people came together to console one another and question what to do next.\n\nAt one point, the crowd began to chant, \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Samuel Alito's gotta go.\" \"We will not go back.\" \"Abortion rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back.\" \"Pack the courts.\"\n\nPolitico's publishing of the draft is unprecedented by the high court's standards of secrecy. The inner deliberations among the justices while opinions are being drafted and votes are being settled are among the most closely held details in Washington.\n\n\"This news is simply stunning for the Supreme Court as an institution,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"Not only is the result it portends -- the overruling of Roe and Casey -- a shockwave to our constitutional politics, but we have never seen a leak remotely like this from inside the Court, where we're not just hearing what the result is going to be, but we're seeing the draft majority opinion in advance. It's hard to believe that the former doesn't help to explain the latter, but it's an earthquake in both respects.\"\n\nThe case in question is Dobbs v. Jackson. It concerns a challenge to Mississippi's 15-week ban on abortion and oral arguments were heard on December 1. The release of a final opinion in the case is expected later this Spring or early summer.\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito writes that Roe \"must be overruled.\"\n\n\"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,\" Alito wrote. He said that Roe was \"egregiously wrong from the start\" and that its reasoning was \"exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\"\n\nHe added, \"It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's representatives.\"\n\n\"That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand,\" he said, according to the draft.\n\nAlready nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion, while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\nProcess of voting\n\nOral arguments in the case were held on December 1.\n\nUnder normal procedure, by the end of that week the justices would have met in their private conference to take a preliminary vote on the issue. They would have gone around the table in order of seniority discussing their take on the case. Roberts would have gone first, with Barrett last.\n\nAfter that initial tally, if Roberts was in the majority he would assign the majority opinion. Otherwise the most senior justice would have taken that responsibility. After that, draft opinions would go between chambers. In the past, justices have changed their votes and sometimes a majority opinion ultimately becomes a dissent.\n\nA reversal of Roe would leave abortion policy up to individual states and would likely produce a patchwork system where the procedure would remain largely available in Democratic-led states, while Republican-led states would pass extreme limits or outright bans on it.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Unbelievable shift': Klobuchar reacts to draft Supreme Court opinion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Unbelievable shift': Klobuchar reacts to draft Supreme Court opinion 02:38\n\nThe Dobbs case was perhaps the most anticipated case of the court's term, and most court observers expected that the conservative majority was likely to scale back or outright overturn Roe's holding. At oral arguments, Roberts was the only one of the six Republican appointees who signaled interest in exploring a narrower opinion that would have upheld Mississippi's law but preserved some protections for abortion rights.\n\nBecause it is one of the court's most high-stakes and contentious decisions, the anticipation was that the opinion would be among the final ones the court released at the end of its term in late June.\n\nRoe is the law of the land until the court formally issues its opinion.\n\n\"Let's be clear: This is a draft opinion. It's outrageous, it's unprecedented, but it's not final. Abortion is your right -- and it is STILL LEGAL,\" Planned Parenthood said in a tweet following Politico's reporting.\n\nDecades-long project of conservative legal moment\n\nOverturning Roe would be the culmination of a decades-long project of the conservative legal moment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, when running for the White House in 2016, promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe \"automatically.\" His nominee Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sided with the liberal justices in past abortion rights cases. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Democratic appointee and abortion rights champion who died weeks before the 2020 election.\n\nCelebrated by supporters of abortion right and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability, which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey . A majority of the court in that case replaced Roe's framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an \"undue burden\" on the right to abortion, which is defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\"\n\nAccording to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in January , most Americans oppose overturning Roe, with a majority saying that if the decision was vacated, they'd want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws.\n\nJust 30% of Americans say they'd like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn its Roe vs. Wade decision, with 69% opposed -- a finding that's largely consistent both with other recent polling and with historical trends.\n\nStare decisis and overturning precedent\n\nIn the opinion, Alito also addresses the fact that Roe has been on the books for some 50 years. Although the court is loath to overturn precedent, Alito says it must do so. He said that the notion of \"stare decisis\" does not \"compel unending adherence to Roe's abuse of judicial authority.\"\n\nHe said that instead of \"bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue\" Roe and a follow-on decision \"have enflamed debate and deepened division.\"\n\n\"The inescapable conclusion,\" Alito wrote, according to the draft, \"is that a right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions.\"\n\nHe also said the decision was on a \"collision course\" with the Constitution \"from the day it was decided.\"\n\nAlito also pushed back on the notion that if the court were to overturn Roe it could lead the court to overturn other cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, that upheld the right to same-sex marriage. He said that what \"sharply distinguishes\" Roe from other cases is that \"abortion destroys\" potential life.\n\nJUST WATCHED Coates describes potential socioeconomic impact if Roe v.

As of April 2022, 536 abortion restrictions have been introduced in 42 states.\n\nDemocrats outraged, call to end filibuster\n\nPresident Joe Biden said a woman's right to have an abortion is \"fundamental\" in his first statement on the issue Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nSeveral Senate Democratic candidates immediately called for the elimination of the filibuster and passing legislation to protect abortion rights.\n\n\"Democrats need to act NOW—end the filibuster, codify Roe, and defend reproductive freedom,\" tweeted Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski , who's running for her party's nomination for Senate.\"This fight is too urgent.\"\n\n\"Control of the Senate has never been more important: it's time to end the filibuster, pass the Women's Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington,\" added Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who's favored to win his Democratic primary on Tuesday.\n\nThe push from the Democratic candidates and others is likely to fail, unless some incumbent senators change their minds. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats need every vote to eliminate the chamber's rules requiring 60 votes to advance most legislation. And Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have repeatedly committed to protecting the filibuster, which sets up a 60-vote threshold that requires bipartisan cooperation to pass most legislation.\n\nIn February, Manchin also joined Senate Republicans in blocking the House-passed Women's Health Protection Act that aimed to preserve access to abortion.\n\nIn a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said overturning Roe would be \"the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years -- not just on women but on all Americans.\"\n\n\"Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court's reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/politics/cnn-poll-abortion-midterms-roe-v-wade/index.html", "title": "CNN poll: The Supreme Court's draft opinion on Roe v. Wade hasn't ...", "text": "(CNN) Americans remain broadly opposed to overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS , following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would strike down the landmark ruling.\n\nSixty-six percent say Roe v. Wade should not be completely struck down, and 59% would support Congress passing legislation to establish a nationwide right to abortion, including 81% of Democrats, 65% of independents and 30% of Republicans, the survey finds.\n\nBut comparing the results of the new poll to one conducted immediately before the revelation of the draft opinion, the impact on the political landscape heading into the 2022 midterms appears fairly muted.\n\nThe share of registered voters who say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this fall rose 6 points between the first survey and the second, but that increase is about even across party lines. Among Democrats, 43% now say they are extremely or very enthusiastic, up 7 points. Among Republicans, it's 56%, up 9 points. And voters who say overturning Roe would make them \"happy\" are nearly twice as enthusiastic about voting this fall as those who say such a ruling would leave them \"angry\" (38% extremely enthusiastic among those happy, 20% among those angry).\n\nThe share of Americans who would be angry in the wake of such a ruling (36%) sharply outweighs that who would be happy (17%), and some of the poll's findings suggest the issue could become a motivating factor for Roe supporters should the draft opinion become the final one. Younger adults are particularly apt to say they would feel angry if Roe were overturned (47% among those younger than 45, compared with 26% among older adults). But younger voters remain far less enthusiastic about casting a ballot this fall -- just 9% of them are extremely enthusiastic about voting this fall vs. 31% of older voters.\n\nMore broadly, 37% of Americans strongly support Congress establishing a nationwide right to abortion , more than the 28% who strongly oppose such an action. Half (51%) say that if Roe falls, they want their state to become a safe haven for women seeking abortion, compared with 20% who say the procedure should be banned completely in their state. And the share of Americans who say their views on abortion align more with Democrats than Republicans rose 7 points between the two polls (44% with Democrats, 32% with Republicans in the later poll vs. 37% Democrats, 31% Republicans in the earlier one).\n\nAbortion not the only factor for most voters\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow edge over Democrats on the generic ballot test, 49% to 42% among registered voters, a slight improvement for Republicans compared with the poll conducted immediately before the ruling. On the economy -- the issue most likely to be a driving factor for voters this fall -- nearly half of adults (46%) in the latest poll say the Republican Party's positions are more aligned with their own, compared with 31% for the Democratic Party. About three-quarters say that which party controls Congress makes a real difference -- a figure that did not shift between the two polls -- with more Republicans saying so than Democrats (88% vs. 78%).\n\nThose findings suggest the overall picture for the midterm elections is little changed after this week's news , at least in the short term. Only about half of the country say they have heard a great deal or a good amount about the draft Supreme Court opinion thus far (49%), with 51% saying they've heard just some or nothing at all about it.\n\nThe poll conducted after the draft ruling became public also finds a small increase since January in the share of Americans who say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion; that view increased more among Republicans (from 15% in January to 26% now) than among Democrats (24% in January to 29% now). On this measure, though, the ideological divide tells a different story, with liberals' commitment to a candidate who shares their views on abortion rising 12 points; among conservatives, it's up 6 points.\n\nShould Roe fall, most now say they would like their own state to set abortion laws that are more permissive toward abortion (58%) than restrictive (42%). Those percentages are similar to the results of a CNN poll conducted in January, though about half (52%) think abortions would become at least somewhat harder to get where they live if Roe were overturned. There is a larger share in the new poll compared with January, though, who say that if Roe is struck down, they do not think that abortion would become harder to get where they live (25% now vs. 14% in January). That shift is driven mostly by men: 35% say so now vs. 19% in January. Among women, 16% say so now vs. 10% in January.\n\nFurther threats to privacy\n\nIn considering the impact that a ruling like the draft opinion might have on other laws resting on privacy rights, Americans are more likely to see a couple's right to marry regardless of their gender as under threat (38% see it as threatened, 35% as secure) than they are to say the same of a woman's right to use contraception (23% threatened, 63% secure) or a couple's right to marry regardless of race or ethnicity (19% threatened, 66% secure). Democrats see more of a threat across the board, including 57% who say same-sex marriage is threatened vs. 21% among Republicans. Overall, nearly two-thirds (63%) say the Supreme Court ought to consider public opinion in making its decisions.\n\nThere are particularly sharp divisions by age over abortion, and the strong backing for abortion rights among younger adults suggests an opening Democrats could use to boost their standing with this group, whose support of President Joe Biden has waned. Among those younger than 45, 75% oppose overturning Roe and 68% support Congress establishing a nationwide abortion right, compared with 58% opposed to overturning Roe and 51% in favor of congressional action to codify abortion rights among those older than 45. And 30% of younger people say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the issue vs. 23% among older people.\n\nIn the earlier poll, perceptions of each party's alignment with the mainstream are about equal. Roughly half of the public, 52%, say they see the views and policies of the Democratic Party as generally mainstream rather than too extreme, with 54% saying the same of the Republican Party. Partisans are generally comfortable with their own party: 90% of Republicans see the GOP as mainstream, and an identical 90% of Democrats consider their party to be mainstream. Just 13% of Americans view both parties as too extreme.\n\nWhile Republicans are better aligned with Americans' views on the economy and Democrats on abortion, the two polls show that several other issues are more closely divided. Americans are split on which party shares more of their views on voting rights and election integrity (41% say Democrats, 38% Republicans), helping the middle class (35% Democrats, 32% Republicans), education (35% Democrats, 34% Republicans) and the United States' role in world affairs (35% say Republicans, 30% Democrats). The GOP has a significant lead on immigration (42% to 34%) and crime and policing (43% to 28%), while Democrats do on women's rights (45% to 29%). Other than abortion, Americans' party preferences changed little on the issues that were tested in both surveys.\n\nThe two CNN polls were conducted by SSRS online and by phone, with both samples drawn from a probability-based panel. One survey was conducted from April 28-May 1 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults. Results for the full sample of that poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The second was conducted from May 3-5 among a random national sample of 800 adults. It has an error margin of plus or minus 4.5 points.\n\nThe headline of this story has been updated.", "authors": ["Jennifer Agiesta", "Ariel Edwards-Levy"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/white-house-executive-order-abortion/index.html", "title": "Abortion executive order: Biden signs executive order Friday aimed ...", "text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden signed an executive order Friday aimed at protecting abortion rights in response to the landmark decision by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v.

I don't care what your position is, it's outrageous and it's dangerous,\" Biden said. He was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nThere is no action the President can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling, and Biden has acknowledged publicly his options to expand abortion access remain limited.\n\nNonetheless, Democrats and advocates have been pressuring the White House take a stronger stance to codify abortion access. Last month, Biden hinted he was considering taking executive action, telling Jimmy Kimmel that while he believed Congress should codify Roe, \"There's some executive orders I could employ, we believe -- we're looking at that right now.\"\n\nJen Klein, the co-chair and executive director of the White House Gender Policy Council, said Friday the White House is \"looking at everything\" to ensure access to abortion and that declaring a public health emergency \"is definitely not off the table.\"\n\nKlein said the step had not been taken because the White House had determined that declaring a public health emergency \"doesn't free very many resources\" and \"doesn't release a significant amount of legal authority.\"\n\nFriday's executive order will prompt Becerra to take steps to ensure access to abortion, including FDA-approved medication abortion and expanded access \"to the full range of reproductive health services,\" according to an administration fact sheet shared with CNN. Those services include \"emergency contraception and long-acting reversible contraception like intrauterine devices (IUDs),\" the fact sheet says, citing coverage of birth control under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHHS is tasked with submitting a report within the next 30 days to the President regarding the implementation of the order's provisions, which also include steps to increase outreach and protect the medical and digital privacy of patients seeking abortions.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'I want him to throw the first punch': Hear Bakari Sellers' message to Biden Replay More Videos ...

Marriage equality. Contraception. So much more is at risk. This decision affects everyone.\"\n\nBiden said the fastest way to restore abortion rights was for the American people to elect more members of Congress in November's midterm elections who will support federal legislation protecting abortion access.\n\nHe said it was his \"hope and strong belief that women will in fact turn out in record numbers to reclaim the rights that have been taken from them by the court.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear: While I wish it had not come to this, this is the fastest route available,\" Biden said.\n\nMini Timmaraju, the head of the prominent abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement that the executive order is \"an important first step.\"\n\n\"We're encouraged by the Biden-Harris administration's work to defend abortion rights and access, and look forward to continuing partnership with the administration to make good on its commitment to championing reproductive freedom.\"\n\nThe White House has dismissed several progressive ideas to protect abortion access, including allowing abortion providers to work from federal property in states where the procedure is banned.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said using federal lands for abortion services would have \"dangerous ramifications.\" The White House has also reiterated the President does not support expanding the Supreme Court, as many progressives have pushed for.\n\nBut Biden said recently he would support making an exception to the filibuster -- the 60-vote threshold in the Senate needed to pass most legislation -- in order to codify abortion rights and the right to privacy through legislation passed by Congress. The President had previously been reluctant to support changing the Senate's rules in order to pass his agenda.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- two lawmakers whose support the President would need -- both quickly expressed opposition to changing filibuster rules , essentially blocking any plan to drop those rules.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan", "Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/02/primaries-arizona-kansas-michigan-missouri-washington/10153749002/", "title": "Primary recap: Kansas voters uphold abortion rights, Trump-backed ...", "text": "Tuesday's primary elections are shaping up to be among the most consequential in the 2022 cycle.\n\nThe latest primaries featured contests in Arizona and Michigan, which were ground zero in former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election.

I'm not running against David Farnsworth,\" Bowers told Insider in July. \"I'm running against Donald Trump. It's his name that's propping up Dave Farnsworth.\"\n\nBowers told the Jan. 6 committee in June that after Trump advertisements urged supporters to contact lawmakers to pressure them to overturn their election results, he received more than 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts. The pressure campaign ultimately resulted in weekly protests outside Bowers' home, including one where there was an armed man.\n\nBowers' primary is another test of Trump's influence in the Grand Canyon State.\n\n— Ella Lee\n\nDemocrats face uphill climb in Kansas\n\nIncumbent Democrat Laura Kelly surprised many political observers when she upset Republican Kris Kobach in the 2018 governor’s race.\n\nBut four years later the GOP is betting it's harder to be a red state Democrat now.\n\nAttorney General Derek Schmidt, who is endorsed by Trump, is expected to seize the Republican nomination. The former president won the Sunflower State by 14 points in 2020 and by 20 points in 2016.\n\nThere is also anxiety about Rep. Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in Kansas’ congressional delegation. Her seat was significantly changed by the Republican-controlled state legislature during redistricting, and attempts to overturn those changes failed in court.\n\nDavids, a former mixed martial artists, held what had been considered a safe seat, but after the maps were redrawn it is rated as one of the 26 Democratic \"toss-up\" races by The Cook Political Report.\n\n— Phillip M.

Ohio has 33 members in its state Senate and 99 in the House.\n\nAmong the candidates on the ballot in Ohio on Tuesday is Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage.

But that didn’t stop conspiracy theorists — emboldened by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud — from calling Barton and making death threats for what they falsely believed was her role in rigging the election.\n\nSince Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, election clerks in Michigan have faced an onslaught of Freedom of Information Act requests, the influx of new election workers possibly armed with political agendas, and an increased need to more security funding.\n\nTaken together, the election officials say, the lingering effects of the 2020 election make running elections this year harder than ever.\n\n— Andrew Marquardt and Isabel Miller, Medill News Service\n\nMichigan GOP candidate deflects question on 'stolen election'\n\nLANSING, Mich. — Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon would not say during a national TV appearance Sunday whether she thought the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nIt was a shift from the position she took during a candidate debate in May.\n\nIn what could be a sign of an early pivot to a general election campaign, Dixon, appearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" instead shifted the conversation to what she described as legitimate concerns about the way the election was conducted and her support for strict voter ID requirements and other proposed changes to state election law.\n\nThe apparent pivot in Dixon's position away from the \"big lie\" promoted by former President Donald Trump came less than 48 hours after Trump endorsed Dixon, on Friday night, in Tuesday's five-candidate GOP primary.\n\n— Paul Egan, Detroit Free Press\n\nGOP rollercoaster to face Whitmer\n\nDemocratic Gov.

He is considered a favorite in the Republican primary for secretary of state.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic incumbent Jocelyn Benson was thrust into the national spotlight after receiving death threats for resisting attempts to subvert the election.\n\nBut she could face Republican Kristina Karamo, a Trump-backed contender who has cast doubt on the 2020 election results. Michigan nominates candidates for secretary of state through each party's convention.\n\nFinchem and Karamo are part of a Trump-backed coalition of secretaries of state candidates running in key swing states who have spread the former president's election lies.\n\nIn Nevada, for instance, Jim Marchant, who said the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from Trump, easily won a seven-way Republican primary for secretary of state.\n\n— Phillip M.

Russian authorities said she carried vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage; Griner said during the trial that took place in Khmiki, Russia, that she accidentally packed them in haste and pleaded guilty \"without intent.\" The court, however, claimed she committed the crime deliberately.\n\n“The hard work that my parents instilled in me is what brought me to play for the best EuroLeague and Russian team here in Ekaterinburg,” Griner said Thursday from a cage inside the courtroom. “I want to apologize to my teammates, the club, the fans and the city of (Ekaterinburg for) the mistake that I made and the embarrassment I brought.\n\n“This is my second home. All I wanted to do was win a championship and make them proud.”\n\nExperts in the Russian legal system – which has a 99% conviction rate – said admitting to the transgression could result in leniency on the 10-year maximum sentence Griner faced.\n\nThe lead prosecutor against Griner asked the judge to sentence her to nine years and six months in a prison colony.\n\n“I know everybody keeps talking about 'political pawn' and politics.

But Russia's drug laws are 'draconian.'\n\nTIMELINE:What has happened since the WNBA star was detained\n\n\"Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG’s personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence,\" they said.\n\nGriner's lawyers called the verdict \"absolutely unreasonable\" and said it did not account for her plea. They will file an appeal.\n\nGriner, 31, won the 2014 WNBA title in her second season with the Phoenix Mercury, the only WNBA team for which she has played. She is a two-time scoring champion and has led the league in blocks eight times. She also won gold for Team USA women’s basketball at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo.\n\nIn a joint statement, the WNBA and NBA said: \"Today's verdict and sentencing is unjustified and unfortunate ... it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States.\"\n\nGriner’s arrest did not become public knowledge until nearly three weeks after it occurred. Americans arrested abroad typically have consular access – a staffer at the nearest U.S. Embassy can provide legal assistance. Griner was unable to meet with any representative of the U.S. government until March 23.\n\nOn May 3, the U.S. State Department officially classified her as “wrongfully detained,” and her case moved into the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Her trial, referred to as a \"sham\" by those with expertise in the Russian legal system, began July 1. Prosecutors argued Griner had less than one gram of cannabis in her luggage.\n\nThe most likely way the U.S. will secure the early release of Griner and fellow American Paul Whelan, who has also been classified as \"wrongfully detained,\" is via prisoner swap – similar to the one that brought Trevor Reed back from Russia earlier this year. Whelan has been in custody since 2018 and is serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges the U.S. government disputes.\n\n\"American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after Griner's sentencing. \"It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates.\n\n\"My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe State Department, in an extraordinary move last week, revealed the existence of a \"substantial offer\" to free Griner and Whelan. The prisoner swap revolved around notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed \"The Merchant of Death.\" Last Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov connected for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nThe war and sanctions placed on Russia by the United States have led to tension between the two countries. Griner's supporters at home have referred to her as a \"political pawn.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Griner released excerpts of her letter to President Joe Biden on July 4. The Texas native wrote to Biden: \"I’m terrified I might be here forever. Please do all you can to bring us home.\"\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris called Cherelle Griner, Brittney's wife, later that week for the first time since her arrest. Cherelle Griner has repeatedly called on the government to increase the urgency in returning her spouse.\n\nRussian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned after the second day of Griner's trial that “attempts by the American side to make noise in public ... don’t help the practical settlement of issues.”\n\nBlinken said in a statement Thursday: \"This step puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.\n\n\"Nothing about today’s decision changes our determination that Brittney Griner is wrongfully detained, and we will continue working to bring Brittney and fellow wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan home.

Her team did not dispute that she should not have brought the vape cartridges and that they were accidentally packed.\n\nJuly 27: U.S. makes 'substantial' offer for prisoner swap\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States made a proposal to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American who has been in Russian custody since 2018 and is serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges the U.S. disputes.\n\nCNN reported that the U.S. offered Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer nicknamed \"The Merchant of Death,\" for the prisoner swap.\n\n\"There is utility in sending clear, direct messages to the Russians on key priorities for us,\" Blinken said. \"These include the return of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, and following through on the grain agreement.\"\n\nJuly 29: Blinken speaks with Russian Foreign Minister\n\nFor the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, Blinken connected with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. It was a \"frank and direct conversation\" regarding the release of Griner and Whelan. Lavrov and Russia responded by suggesting the U.S. keep the negotiations private.\n\nAugust 2: Prosecutors call narcotics expert\n\nGriner's defense has pointed to a doctor's recommendation for medicinal cannabis use as to why Griner accidentally packed the cartridges. However, the state responded by calling on a narcotics expert who analyzed a sample of what authorities said they discovered.\n\nAugust 4: Griner convicted of drug possession and smuggling\n\nGriner's six-month saga came to an end on Aug. 4 when she was officially convicted of drug possession and smuggling following a trial that lasted a little over a month. Russian prosecutors asked that she receive 9½ years in prison, and she was sentenced to nine years behind bars.\n\nContributing: Scooby Axson.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/brittney-griner-trial/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner: WNBA star sentenced to 9 years in Russian jail for ...", "text": "(CNN) American women's basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time Thursday in a case that has raised concerns she is being used as a political pawn in Russia's war against Ukraine .\n\nJudge Anna Sotnikova of the Khimki city court delivered the sentence and fined Griner 1 million rubles, or about $16,400. She said the court took into account Griner's partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail.\n\nPrior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech.\n\n\"I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,\" Griner said. \"I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn't end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom.\n\n\"I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,\" she added.\n\nAfter the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, \"I love my family.\"\n\nThe verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry.\n\nGriner's lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal.\n\n\"We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,\" they said in the statement. \"This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.\"\n\nSpeaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole.\n\nGriner \"is not doing fine today,\" said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held.\n\nSentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations\n\nPhotos: WNBA Star Brittney Griner Brittney Griner of Team USA looks on during the game against the Team Australia during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on August 4, 2021.

The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely.\n\nCharge d'Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a \"miscarriage of justice,\" and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It's unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence \"puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia's legal system and the Russian government's use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.\"\n\nHe said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. \"This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department's,\" Blinken said.\n\nIt's now \"up to the Russian side\" on whether Griner's conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\n\"We're still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they're more empowered to do that, then so be it,\" Kirby told reporters in Thursday's White House briefing.\n\nKirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to \"take the deal on the table because it's a good one, it's a fair one, and it'll help bring Paul and Brittney home.\"\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia's court proceedings are not legitimate.\n\n\"This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,\" he said. \"What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED WNBA star's lawyers: cannabis was prescribed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WNBA star's lawyers: cannabis was prescribed 02:21\n\nThe Kremlin warned Tuesday that US \"megaphone diplomacy\" will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be \"discrete.\"\n\nGriner's WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, \"Bring her home! Bring her home!\" Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.\n\nThe Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a \"We Are BG\" T-shirt, said after the game the verdict was devastating.\n\n\"Nobody wanted to even play today,\" she told reporters. \"How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.\"\n\nEarlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict \"a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare\" of her detention.\n\n\"We are inspired every day by BG's strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,\" the statement reads.\n\nHead coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner's sentence is \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"It's just heartbreaking,\" the coach said. \"To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as \"unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.\"\n\n\"The WNBA and NBA's commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,\" they said.\n\nDefense asked for leniency in closing arguments\n\nThe court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant's cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason.\n\nIn closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued.\n\nEven if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor's prescription, she added. She couldn't have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said.\n\nBoykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication.\n\nBoykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, \"Basically, it means that you are guilty.\"\n\nThroughout the trial, Griner's attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution's case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport.\n\nHer detention, search and arrest were \"improper,\" Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.\n\nAfter she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.\n\nNo lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest.\n\nOn Tuesday, at the seventh hearing in her case, a defense expert testified that the examination of the substance contained in Griner's vape cartridges did not comply with Russian law. Blagovolina also told CNN her team's experts identified \"a few defects\" in the machines used to measure the substance.\n\nAt trial, Griner testified she has a doctor's prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said.\n\n\"We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,\" Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said.", "authors": ["Anna Chernova", "Zahra Ullah", "Masha Angelova", "Chris Liakos", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2022/07/13/brittney-griner-has-support-woman-jailed-russia-over-cannabis/10055064002/", "title": "Brittney Griner has support from woman jailed in Russia over cannabis", "text": "Naama Issachar, an American Israeli woman who spent 10 months in Russian prison for traveling with a small amount of cannabis, is breaking her silence for the first time as her case draws comparisons to WNBA star Brittney Griner.\n\n\"I know what (Griner is) going through,\" Issachar, 28, said during an exclusive interview with NBC Nightly yNews' Kate Snow. \"I see the videos of her and I’m like, I know that courtroom.\"\n\nIssachar was arrested in 2019 and sentenced to 7½ years in prison after 0.3 ounces of marijuana was found in her luggage during a three-hour layover in Moscow while traveling from India to Israel.

Her next hearing is set for July 14.\n\nGriner was arrested in February at a Moscow airport after Russian officials say they found cannabis oil in her luggage. The basketball star, who plays in Russia during the WNBA's offseason, has been held since then on drug smuggling charges. Her trial began last week\n\nGriner told the court Thursday she had not intended to commit a crime, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Griner had not meant to carry drugs in her luggage, she said through an interpreter, and it was the result of her packing in a hurry, the report said.\n\nThe decision to plead guilty was made by Griner alone, a source close to her said. But in recent weeks, Griner, her family, lawyers and experts had discussed this decision extensively. Given the 99% reported conviction rate in Russian criminal cases, Griner was urged to weigh all the factors, including a plea that could ultimately result in a shorter sentence.\n\nSome have speculated Griner could be released and returned to the US in a prisoner swap, as was Trevor Reed, an American veteran detained in Russia for three years before his release in April\n\nThere is no indication such a swap is imminent in Griner's case.\n\nStill, before any potential prisoner swap, it was expected Griner would have to be convicted and also admit fault, a senior US official told CNN. Reed had to sign a document saying he was guilty -- something he had resisted for almost the entirety of his detention -- just days before he was let out, the official said.\n\n\"It is part of the show and the document has no legal force or effect in the US. It is effectively meaningless,\" said Reed family spokesperson Jonathan Franks.\n\nGriner's plea came on the second day of her trial, at which a prosecutor accused her of smuggling less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. Prosecutors argue Griner intended to import the drugs into Russia's territory and put the prohibited substances into a backpack and a suitcase, according to TASS, another state news agency.\n\nGriner appreciates letter from Biden, lawyer says\n\nAt Thursday's hearing, a senior US diplomat gave Griner a letter US President Joe Biden wrote her in reply to her July 4 letter in which she pleaded for Biden's help. The US Embassy in Moscow shared Biden's letter with Griner during her trial, Charge d'affaires Elizabeth Rood said Thursday.\n\nGriner appreciated Biden's letter \"like every citizen of every country would appreciate a personal letter from the President,\" Boykov said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had spoken by phone with Griner's wife. Cherelle Griner was \"grateful\" for the call, she said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"While I will remain concerned and outspoken until (Brittney Griner) is back home, I am hopeful in knowing that the President read my wife's letter and took the time to respond,\" she said. \"I know BG will be able to find comfort in knowing she has not been forgotten.\"\n\nMeantime, the US government should \"continue doing what they are doing and exhaust every measure possible to help bring BG home,\" Griner's Mercury head coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN on Thursday following her plea.\n\nWhile the focus must be on bringing Griner home safely, Nygaard also called out a perceived double standard in the \"lack of coverage and the value of women's sports.\"\n\n\"The question is, would Tom Brady be home?\" the coach said. \"But Tom Brady wouldn't be there, right, because he doesn't have to go to a foreign country to supplement his income from the WNBA.\"\n\nA rally Wednesday for Griner held by the Mercury and the office of US Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona was \"really, really wonderful,\" Nygaard said, adding she still was concerned about Griner's safety in Russia.\n\n\"In her letter (to Biden), she said that she was scared,\" the coach said. \"This is not just a regular American in another country, but this is a person who is represented our country well.

The politically charged case comes amid high tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia’s military action in Ukraine.\n\nIn an extraordinary move, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke last week to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, urging him to accept a deal under which Griner and Paul Whelan, an American jailed in Russia on espionage charges, would go free.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT? Brittney Griner sentenced to nine years on drug charges in Russia\n\nBRITTNEY GRINER TIMELINE:Events leading up to the WNBA star's conviction in Russia\n\nDANGEROUS, BUT NECESSARY: US negotiates scary Brittney Griner swap with Russia\n\nLavrov and Blinken were both in Cambodia on Friday for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Blinken did not even glance at his Russian counterpart as they took their seats at an East Asia Summit.\n\nLavrov told reporters that Blinken didn’t try to contact him while they were attending the ASEAN meeting.\n\n“We were separated by just one person at the discussion table, but I didn’t feel his desire to catch me. My buttons are all in place,” he said when asked about Washington’s statement that Blinken would try to buttonhole Lavrov for a quick interaction in Phnom Penh.\n\nLavrov said Moscow was “ready to discuss” a prisoner swap but that the topic should only be discussed via a dedicated Russia-U.S. channel that U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to establish when they met in Geneva in June 2021.\n\n“If the Americans again try to engage in public diplomacy and make loud statements about their intention to take certain steps, it’s their business, I would even say their problem,” Lavrov said. “The Americans often have trouble observing agreements on calm and professional work.”\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made the same point more harshly, saying “the U.S. already has made mistakes, trying to solve such problems via ‘microphone diplomacy.’ They are not solved that way.”\n\nHe, too, emphasized that any discussions on a possible trade should be held via the previously established confidential channels that Putin and Biden agree to during last year’s summit.\n\n“Such mechanisms exist, but they will be thrown into doubt if the discussion continues in the public domain,” Peskov said.

Prosecutors also will have an opportunity to question Griner.\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medalist made a brief court appearance at the Khimki court of the Moscow region on Tuesday where her defense team presented evidence.\n\nGriner, 31, pleaded guilty to drug charges earlier this month but the US State Department says she is wrongfully detained. She faces up to 10 years in prison. Griner's supporters have called for her release over fears she is being used as a political pawn amid Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing, which lasted about an hour, a narcologist brought in by Griner's lawyers said that based on the WNBA player's prescription, it is likely Griner used the cannabis oil found in her luggage for medical purposes rather than recreational purposes.\n\nThe narcologist, Mikhail Tetyushkin, explained that \"medical cannabis is a popular treatment specifically among athletes\" in many countries outside Russia.\n\nTetyushkin presented the court with information on the use of medical marijuana by athletes, saying that the frequent use of cannabinoids is incompatible with professional sports due to the effect of relaxation and inhibition of reaction times.\n\nHe also told the court on Tuesday that there is no global standard on the quantity of cannabinoids in medical marijuana.\n\nGriner's lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, told the court that an initial report from the prosecution's expert witness was \"inconsistent\" and not according to scientific and legal standards.\n\nBlagovolina said the report from the prosecution's expert witness did not determine the quantitative content of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the cannabis oil found in Griner's luggage. THC is the principal psychoactive substance in cannabis.\n\nWhen the hearing concluded, Blagovolina said Tetyushkin \"explained that in various countries -- namely in the US -- medical cannabis is a popular treatment specifically among athletes.\"\n\n\"Thus, with the prescription in place, Brittney may have used it for medical but not recreational purposes,\" Blagovolina added.\n\nTuesday's hearing, the fifth so far in Griner's criminal trial, was attended by US Embassy Charge d'Affaires Elizabeth Rood.\n\nSpeaking to press outside the court, Rood told reporters that Griner confirmed that she is doing as \"well as can be expected under these circumstances.\"\n\nThe trial is expected to end early next month, Griner's lawyers have said.\n\nGriner detained since February\n\nThe Phoenix Mercury basketball star was arrested in February at a Moscow airport with less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. Griner, who plays in Russia during the WNBA's offseason, has been held since then on drug smuggling charges. Her trial began in early July.\n\nA prosecutor at the start of her trial in Moscow accused Griner of intentionally smuggling the drugs into Russia.\n\nGriner told a court that she had not intended to commit a crime and that it was the result of her packing in a hurry, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Her defense team told Russian judges that she was prescribed medical cannabis for \"severe chronic pain.\"\n\nThe defense hopes the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and the sentence won't be severe.\n\nThe decision to plead guilty was made by Griner alone, a source close to her has said. But in recent weeks, Griner, her family, lawyers and experts had discussed this decision extensively. Given the 99% reported conviction rate in Russian criminal cases, Griner was urged to weigh all the factors, including a plea that could ultimately result in a shorter sentence.\n\nSome have speculated Griner could be released and returned to the US in a prisoner swap, as was Trevor Reed, an American veteran detained in Russia for three years before his release in April.\n\nStill, before any potential prisoner swap, it was expected Griner would have to be convicted and also admit fault, a senior US official has told CNN. Reed had to sign a document saying he was guilty -- something he had resisted for almost the entirety of his detention -- just days before he was let out, the official said.\n\n'Please don't forget about me'\n\nMany in the WNBA, along with other athletes, coaches and politicians, have called for Griner's release. Griner wrote a letter to President Joe Biden that was delivered to the White House this month, saying she fears she will be detained in Russia indefinitely.\n\n\"I realize you are dealing with so much, but please don't forget about me and the other American Detainees.

Jones told the court Wednesday he now understands it was irresponsible to call the attack a hoax.\n\nJones testified Wednesday he believes the massacre was “100% real.” The admission from the Infowars host was one of many remarkable developments in court Wednesday.\n\nJones attempted to sway a jury that will determine how much he and his media company, Free Speech Systems, owe for defaming the family of a 6-year-old boy who was killed in the 2012 attack, which left 20 students and six educators dead in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nJones has been accused of perjuring himself under oath several times this week, including once by the judge, and was confronted in open court Wednesday by a lawyer for Jesse Lewis' family with an extensive copy of his cell phone records — evidence that was apparently accidentally sent to them by Jones' attorneys.\n\nThe stunning moment appeared to even take Jones by surprise when he was shown copies of his own text messages by Mark Bankston, a lawyer for the boy's parents, Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin.\n\n\"Your attorneys messed up and sent me an entire digital copy of your entire cell phone, with everything text message you've sent for the past two years,\" Bankston says in court Wednesday in a moment that has now gone viral on social media.\n\n\"That is how I know you lied to me when you said you did not have text messages about Sandy Hook,\" he continued. Jones pushed back, saying he was being truthful and the accusation from Bankston was a \"Perry Mason moment,\" alluding to a fictional defense attorney character.\n\nWhile Jones chalked it up to proof that he had complied with a court order to turn over information, Bankston said the evidence shows that Jones was untruthful about his text messages during the discovery period of the trial and potentially committed perjury.\n\n\"My lawyers sent it to you but I'm hiding, okay,\" Jones said, before the judge warned both Jones and Bankston to simply answer and ask questions.\n\nThe revelations Wednesday came one day after Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin testified about the suffering, death threats and harassment they’ve endured after the death of their son because of what Jones has trumpeted on his media platforms.\n\n'LIVING HELL':Sandy Hook parents say Alex Jones' claims spawned death threats, harassment\n\n'THIS FEELS DIFFERENT':Why advocates have real hope for gun reform after Buffalo, Uvalde shootings\n\nIn a gripping exchange, Lewis spoke directly to Jones, who was sitting about 10 feet away.\n\nAt one point, Lewis asked Jones: “Do you think I’m an actor?”\n\n“No, I don’t think you’re an actor,” Jones responded before the judge admonished him to be quiet until called to testify.\n\nHeslin told the jury about holding his son with a bullet hole through his head, even describing the extent of the damage to his son’s body. A key segment of the case is a 2017 Infowars broadcast that said Heslin didn’t hold his son.\n\nHeslin and Lewis said Tuesday that an apology wouldn’t suffice and that Jones needed to be held accountable for repeatedly spreading falsehoods about the attack, which was the deadliest school shooting in American history. They are seeking at least $150 million from the trial, which is in its second week.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Jones’ attorney Andino Reynal said the plaintiffs didn’t prove that Jones’ actions and words caused actual harm, and that the trial lacked evidence of the harassment, anguish and character defamation that the parents claimed. He asked the jurors to award the parents $8 — one dollar for each of the compensation charges they are considering.\n\n“Alex Jones may not be to our particular taste, but millions of Americans tune in to be informed, to be entertained, to have their voices heard,” Reynal said. “Speak the truth in your verdict. For them. And for all Americans.”\n\nJones was the only person who testified in his own defense. His attorney asked him if he now understands it was “absolutely irresponsible” to push the false claims that the massacre didn’t happen and no one died.\n\n'A COWARDLY DISPLAY':Alex Jones fails to testify at Sandy Hook deposition\n\nJones said he does, but added, “They (the media) won’t let me take it back.”\n\nJones — who has portrayed the lawsuit against him as an attack on his First Amendment rights — told the jury that any compensation above $2 million “will sink us,” but added: “I think it’s appropriate for whatever you decide what you want to do.”\n\nBut Bankston, during a withering cross-examination, showed the court an email from an Infowars business officer informing Jones that the company had earned $800,000 gross in selling its products in a single day, which would amount to nearly $300 million in a year. Jones said that was the company’s best day in sales.\n\nIt came after Jones claimed, \"I don't use email.\"\n\nBankston said Jones hadn’t complied with court orders to provide text messages and emails for pretrial evidence gathering. Jones told the court he may have \"dictated that\" email.\n\nLAWSUIT:Parents of Sandy Hook student sue conspiracy theorist Alex Jones $150M for defamation\n\nThroughout questioning, Jones acknowledged his history of raising conspiracy claims regarding other mass tragedies, from the Oklahoma City and Boston Marathon bombings to the mass shootings in Las Vegas and Parkland, Florida.\n\nBankston went after Jones’ credibility, showing an Infowars video clip from last week when a host — not Jones — claimed the trial was rigged and featured a photo of the judge in flames. Then came another clip of Jones asking if the jury was selected from a group of people “who don’t know what planet” they live on. Jones said he didn’t mean that part literally.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL ALEX JONES PAY?:Trial begins after judge ruled he defamed Sandy Hook parents\n\nOn Tuesday, Jones was scolded by the judge for not being truthful with some of what he said under oath, telling the jury he had complied with pretrial evidence gathering even though he didn’t and that he is bankrupt, which has not been determined. The plaintiffs’ attorneys were furious about Jones mentioning he is bankrupt, which they worry will taint the jury’s decisions about damages.\n\n“This is not your show,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble told Jones. “Your beliefs do not make something true. You are under oath.”\n\nGUN LEGISLATION:They thought Sandy Hook would 'wake up' the US. Uvalde school shooting proves it didn't.\n\nCourts in Texas and Connecticut have already found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax involving actors aimed at increasing gun control.\n\nAt stake in the Texas trial is how much Jones will pay. The jurors will consider damages in two phases. Once they determine whether Jones should pay the parents compensation for defamation and emotional distress, they must then decide if he must also pay punitive damages. That portion will involve a separate mini-trial involving Jones and financial experts testifying about his and his company’s net worth.\n\nJones has already tried to protect Free Speech Systems financially. The company, which is Infowars’ parent company, filed for federal bankruptcy protection last week. Sandy Hook families have separately sued Jones over his financial claims, arguing that the company is trying to protect millions owned by Jones and his family through shell entities.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/media/alex-jones-sandy-hook-trial/index.html", "title": "Alex Jones: Sandy Hook family attorney exposes conspiracy ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) The dishonesty of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was spotlighted in a Texas court on Wednesday as a lawyer for a pair of Sandy Hook parents cross-examined the Infowars founder and fact-checked his answers in real-time.\n\nThe jury hearing the case will determine how much Jones will have to pay the parents, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis , who won a default judgement against him earlier this year. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis has asked the jury to award $150 million in damages.\n\nJones, who was the sole witness for the defense during the trial, did not fare well Wednesday as he was cross-examined by the plaintiffs' attorney, Mark Bankston.\n\nIn a remarkable moment, Bankston disclosed to Jones and the court that he had recently acquired evidence proving Jones had lied when he claimed during the discovery process that he had never texted about the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting.\n\nBankston said that Jones' attorney had, in an apparent mishap, sent him two years of cell phone records that included every text message Jones had sent.\n\nThe cell phone records, Bankston said, showed that Jones had in fact texted about the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\n\"That is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have text messages about Sandy Hook,\" Bankston said.\n\nBankston showed Jones a text message exchange he had about Sandy Hook. But Jones testified that he had \"never seen these text messages.\"\n\nWhen reminded Jones had testified under oath that he had searched his phone during the discovery phase of the trial and could not locate messages about Sandy Hook, Jones insisted he \"did not lie.\"\n\nJones baselessly said in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 26 people were killed, that the incident was staged. Facing lawsuits, Jones has since acknowledged the shooting occurred.\n\nJones said in a 2019 sworn deposition that a \"form of psychosis\" caused him at the time to believe it was staged.\n\nAnd in court on Wednesday, Jones said that he does believe the Sandy Hook shooting happened, saying it was \"100% real.\"\n\nIn another notable moment during cross-examination Wednesday, Jones was asked whether he had connected Maya Guerra Gamble, the judge overseeing the trial, to pedophilia and human trafficking.\n\nWhen Jones denied having done so, Bankston played video for the court of an Infowars video which did just that.\n\nIn the video, Jones attacked Gamble's prior work for Child Protective Services by claiming the agency had been \"exposed\" for \"working for pedophiles.\"\n\nGamble, whose office did not respond to an earlier request for comment about the fact Infowars has been attacking her in such terms, laughed when she saw a screengrab from the video in court on Wednesday.\n\n\"The person on the left of this image is our judge, correct?\" Bankston asked Jones.\n\nJones replied that it was.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs said Tuesday that they intend to ask for sanctions against Jones for being dishonest on the stand. And Gamble on Tuesday had also admonished Jones for having violated his oath to tell the truth twice.\n\n\"You are already under oath to tell the truth,\" Gamble said Tuesday. \"You've already violated that oath twice today, in just those two examples.

Jones’ attorney asked the jury to limit damages to $8 – $1 for each of the compensation charges they are considering – and Jones himself said any award over $2 million “would sink us.”\n\nWATCH:Alex Jones testifies Sandy Hook shooting was '100 percent real' during defamation trial\n\n'YOUR ATTORNEYS MESSED UP':Alex Jones confronted with texts from his phone in Sandy Hook defamation trial\n\nIt likely won't be the last judgment against Jones over his claims that the attack was staged in the interests of increasing gun control. A Connecticut judge has ruled against him in a similar lawsuit brought by other victims' families and an FBI agent who worked on the case.\n\nThe jury returns Friday to hear more evidence about Jones and his company's finances.\n\n“We aren’t done folks,” Bankston said. “We knew coming into this case it was necessary to shoot for the moon to get to understand we were serious and passionate. After tomorrow, he’s going to owe a lot more.\"\n\nThe Texas award could set a marker for other cases against Jones and underlines the financial threat he's facing. It also raises new questions about the ability of Infowars – which has been banned from YouTube, Spotify and Twitter for hate speech – to continue operating, although the company's finances remain unclear.\n\nJones conceded during the trial that the attack was real and that he was wrong to have lied about it. But Heslin and Lewis told jurors that an apology wouldn't suffice and called on them to make Jones pay for the years of suffering he has put them and other Sandy Hook families through.\n\nJones' media company Free Speech Systems, which is Infowars' parent company, filed for bankruptcy during the two-week trial.\n\nAlso on Thursday, an attorney for the parents said that the U.S. House Jan. 6 committee has requested two years' worth of records from Jones' phone.\n\nAttorney Mark Bankston told the Texas court where Jones is on trial to determine how much he owes for defaming the parents that the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has requested the digital records. He later said outside of court that he plans to comply with the request.\n\nA spokesperson for the committee declined to comment Thursday.\n\nAs Jones testified at the trial on Wednesday, Bankston revealed that the Infowars host's lead attorney, Andino Reynal, had mistakenly sent him the last two years' worth of texts from Jones' cellphone.\n\nReynal asked Judge Maya Guerra Gamble to declare a mistrial over the mistaken transfer of records and said they should have been returned and any copies destroyed. Gamble rejected the request.\n\nReynal also accused Bankston of trying to perform \"for a national audience.\" He said the material included a review copy of text messages over six months from late 2019 into the first quarter of 2020.\n\nBankston said his team followed Texas' civil rules of evidence and that Jones' attorneys missed their chance to properly request the return of the records.\n\n'LIVING HELL':Sandy Hook parents say Alex Jones' claims spawned death threats, harassment\n\n\"Mr. Reynal is using a fig leaf (to cover) for his own malpractice,\" Bankston said.\n\nHe said the records mistakenly sent to him included some medical records of plaintiffs in other lawsuits against Jones.\n\n\"Mr. Jones and his intimate messages with Roger Stone are not protected,\" Bankston said, referring to former President Donald Trump's longtime ally.\n\nRolling Stone, quoting unnamed sources, reported Wednesday evening that the Jan. 6 committee was preparing to subpoena the data from the parents' attorneys to assist in the investigation of the deadly riot.\n\nBankston said outside of court Thursday that the committee had requested the phone records, but hadn't subpoenaed them. He also said he wasn't familiar with everything that was in the records yet, including whether they include any information that the committee is seeking because there was so much information in them.\n\n\"We don't know (yet) the full scope and breadth,\" of the material, Bankston said. \"We certainly saw text messages from as far back as 2019. ... In terms of what all is on that phone, it's going to take a little while to figure that out.\"\n\n\"The Jan. 6 committee doesn't have any more information about what's on that phone than I do. I don't know if it even covers the time period they are interested in,\" he said.\n\nJones didn't attend Thursday's court proceedings. But on his Infowars show Thursday, he said the records were from a year before Jan. 6 and had \"nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"And if anything, I say more radical things on air than I do on text messages. And the idea that there's some type of criminal activity on there is preposterous,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the Jan. 6 committee showed graphic and violent text messages and played videos of right-wing figures, including Jones, and others vowing that Jan. 6 would be the day they would fight for Trump.\n\nThe committee first subpoenaed Jones in November, demanding a deposition and documents related to his efforts to spread misinformation about the 2020 election and a rally on the day of the attack.\n\nIn the subpoena letter, Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman, said Jones helped organize the Jan. 6 rally at the Ellipse that preceded the insurrection. He also wrote that Jones repeatedly promoted Trump's false claims of election fraud, urged his listeners to go to Washington for the rally, and march from the Ellipse to the Capitol.\n\nThompson also wrote that Jones \"made statements implying that you had knowledge about the plans of President Trump with respect to the rally.\"\n\nThe nine-member panel was especially interested in what Jones said shortly after Trump's now-infamous Dec. 19, 2020, tweet in which he told his supporters to \"be there, will be wild!\" on Jan. 6.\n\n\"You went on InfoWars that same day and called the tweet 'One of the most historic events in American history,'\" the letter continued.\n\nIn January, Jones was deposed by the committee during an hourslong, virtual meeting in which he said he exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \"almost 100 times.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/alex-jones-trial-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Get up to speed on Alex Jones' epic comeuppance - CNNPolitics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN's What Matters newsletter.

Read the news report from CNN's Oliver Darcy.\n\nFacing victims. Jones broadcast repeatedly that the Sandy Hook massacre -- which killed 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-olds -- was a hoax and that parents who lost children were actors.\n\nSo it had to be uncomfortable for Jones to sit in court and hear Scarlett Lewis tell him this week about her dead son.\n\nToo late. Jones has publicly accepted the truth that Sandy Hook was \"100% real,\" but only now that his failure to cooperate with the court resulted in a default judgment. He's previously said a \"form of psychosis\" made him dream up the conspiracy theory.\n\nInsulting judge and jury. His company has sought said helped pedophiles. His company has sought bankruptcy protection ahead of the jury's deliberation, and his fate is in the hands of jurors he's characterized as \"blue collar\" and a judge his company has falselysaid helped pedophiles.\n\nThe judge upbraided him for lying in court when he stood as the only witness for his defense.\n\nHe told jurors that his previous lies and insults about them on his show were untrue.\n\n\"I don't think that you are operatives,\" he said at one point. \"I don't think that you are part of a false flag. I don't think that you are bad people. I think you're good people. And I just am very, very critical about the whole process.\"\n\nCaught in a lie. Jones had testified his text messages did not mention Sandy Hook. After his lawyer inadvertently shared a digital copy of the contents of Jones' cellphone, the lawyer for two Sandy Hook parents said the text messages show that Jones lied.\n\nFor a good idea of how slippery and slick Jones can be, watch his expressions during this 2017 interview with NBC News in which he never actually admits Sandy Hook occurred, and where he is asked about his ability to inspire Donald Trump.\n\nThis is his schtick. For an objective look at the facts, read this excellent and in-depth, multipart For an objective look at the facts, read this excellent and in-depth, multipart report from CNN's Rob Kuznia\n\nKey lines:\n\n\"With the verbal fluidity of a great talk show host and the excitable charisma of a televangelist, the hard-charging, gravelly voiced Jones has perfected the WWE-ification of the news: It looks professional, but is far from real.\n\nIf the object of an actual news show is to inform viewers in a compelling way, the object of Infowars is to whip up the ever-dormant flames of populist fear and resentment in service of going viral -- without a thought to who gets hurt or who is driven to violence. It's doom-porn, and the name of the game is to get eyeballs and sell products.\"\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"His tried-and-true schtick has been to declare or strongly imply that high-profile tragedies -- from the 9/11 terror attacks to the Boston Marathon bombing to the Sandy Hook massacre to the latest horrific mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas -- were nefarious government plots aimed at tightening control over Americans.\"\n\nWhere lies don't work. But free speech has limits in court, where lies can be punished as defamation, or worse, perjury, if the lies continue on the witness stand.\n\n\"Over the past few years, we've seen federal and state courts stand strong as a bulwark of truth,\" CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, told me in an email.\n\n\"Whether it's Alex Jones or Rudy Giuliani or a 2020 election denier, it's one thing to spout conspiracy theories on a podcast or social media, but courts demand actual facts and evidence. And, importantly, courts can and will impose accountability and punish people who spread lies for illegal purposes,\" Honig said.\n\nJones and January 6. CNN's Drew Griffin has a special report, \"Megaphone for Conspiracy: the Alex Jones Story,\" which will re-air on Friday at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN on Thursday, Griffin explained why the January 6 committee would want Jones' text messages.\n\n\"Alex Jones, based on our reporting and based on Alex Jones' bragging, quite frankly, said he was very much involved in financing or getting financing for Donald Trump's rally on the Ellipse that day,\" Griffin said. \"He was also very instrumental in promoting the idea of a January 6th gathering in Washington.\"\n\nTies to Oath Keepers. Griffin also noted that Jones frequently featured Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder facing federal Griffin also noted that Jones frequently featured Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder facing federal seditious conspiracy charges, on Infowars. Rhodes has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn Griffin's special report, he tracks video of Jones during the insurrection, as Jones led a march from the Ellipse toward the east side of the Capitol. In the meantime, rioters attacked the west side.\n\nJones soon left the protest to broadcast for Infowars and was among the first to argue, falsely, that the insurrection was being led by Antifa rather than Trump supporters.\n\n\"It's the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt,\" said CNN anchor Chris Wallace on \"New Day\" on Thursday. \"Speak loudly and carry a little stick.\"\n\n\"He walked his people right up to the edge of the Capitol, right up the east front of the Capitol ... and they all go in and they all face the charges and they all face the police, and he goes back to his perch and oversees it and starts talking about Antifa.\"\n\nAbout the election lie. Here's the turn from Jones and his accountability for Sandy Hook lies and potential accountability for election lies.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon refused to cooperate with Congress in the January 6 inquiry, and now he's facing jail time.\n\nTrump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani will testify later this month before a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury that's investigating Trump's attempts to undermine the 2020 election.\n\nThere has also been movement at the Justice Department , where the January 6 investigation has taken testimony from former White House officials in recent days.\n\nStill promising accountability. Attorney General Merrick Garland was asked recently by NBC News if he would be concerned about tearing the country apart by indicting Trump if Trump were to run for president again.\n\n\"We intend to hold everyone -- anyone -- who is criminally responsible for the events surrounding January 6, or any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another, accountable,\" Garland said . \"That's what we do.

Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane were found guilty of violating George Floyd's civil rights by a federal jury in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday.\n\nThe 12 jurors -- four men and eight women -- found Lane, Kueng and Thao guilty of depriving Floyd of his civil rights by showing deliberate indifference to his medical needs as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd for more than 9 minutes on May 25, 2020, ultimately killing him. The jurors also found Thao and Kueng guilty of an additional charge for failing to intervene to stop Chauvin. Lane, who did not face the extra charge, testified that he asked Chauvin twice to reposition Floyd while restraining him but was denied both times.\n\nViolating a person's civil rights \"is punishable by a range of imprisonment up to a life term, or the death penalty, depending upon the circumstances of the crime, and the resulting injury, if any,\" according to the Department of Justice . Federal sentencing guidelines suggest the officers could receive a lesser sentence.\n\nThe three men remain free on bond and are expected to start pre-sentencing proceedings next week.\n\nThe charges stemmed from the officers' actions -- or lack thereof -- as Chauvin pressed his knee into the neck and back of Floyd, who was handcuffed and lying on his stomach on the pavement. Kueng and Lane, both rookie officers, held down Floyd's torso and legs, respectively, while Thao stood nearby and kept a crowd of upset bystanders back.\n\n\"This is just accountability, it can never be justice because I can never get George back,\" Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, said in a news conference Thursday evening.\n\n\"Today closes another important chapter in our journey for justice for George Floyd and his family,\" the Floyd legal team, including attorney Ben Crump, said in a statement after the verdict on Thursday. They added that the verdicts should serve as an example of why police departments \"should expand and prioritize instruction on an officer's duty to intervene and recognize when a fellow officer is using excessive force.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the verdict \"recognizes that two police officers violated the Constitution by failing to intervene to stop another officer from killing George Floyd, and three officers violated the Constitution by failing to provide aid to Mr. Floyd in time to prevent his death,\" in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"George Floyd should be alive today,\" Garland added.\n\nChauvin was convicted last spring of murder and manslaughter in a state trial and was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. Lane, Kueng and Thao, will face a state trial in June on charges of aiding and abetting in the killing, which was pushed back so the federal proceedings could take place first. They have pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\n\"We hope, and we expect, that these officers will once again be held accountable for their lack of humanity,\" the Floyd legal team said in their statement Thursday.\n\nAs part of a plea agreement, Chauvin pleaded guilty in December to the federal civil rights charges related to Floyd's death and the restraint of a teenager in a separate incident. He now faces between 20 and 25 years in prison. Prosecutors requested that he be sentenced to 25 years in prison, to be served concurrently with the sentence from his state trial.\n\nGeorge Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, speaking during a news conference after the verdict was announced on Thursday.\n\nWhat prosecutors had to prove\n\nAt the start of deliberations, the judge instructed jurors that to find the three officers guilty of violating Floyd's rights, they had to find that Floyd had \"an objectively serious medical need,\" that the defendants knew about it and disregarded that need \"by failing to take reasonable measures to address it.\"\n\nFor Thao and Kueng's extra charge, jurors were instructed there were multiple conditions to find guilt.\n\n\"In order to find that any defendant failed to intervene in violation of the Constitution, you must find that the defendant saw Derek Chauvin use force, that the defendant recognized that the use of force was unreasonable, that the defendant had a realistic opportunity to prevent further harm from occurring, and that the defendant chose not to do so,\" the instructions read.\n\nBoth of the counts dealt with critical definitions about whether the officers acted willfully and with specific intent -- critical definitions which were argued back and forth during the trial by prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nProsecutors argued in trial that Floyd could have survived the arrest but that the three officers, despite knowing the amount of force that was being used, chose not to intervene and save Floyd's life as he repeatedly complained he couldn't breathe under Chauvin's knee.\n\n\"It wasn't a split-second use of force like a gunshot,\" Assistant US Attorney Manda Sertich said during closing arguments, referring to Thao and Kueng's extra charge of not intervening to stop Chauvin. \"Not 30 seconds, not a minute, several minutes -- 569 seconds.\"\n\nThe officers' defense attorneys argued their clients did not willfully fail to help Floyd, with Thao's lawyer saying in closing arguments that \"just because something has a tragic ending doesn't mean it's a crime.\" Attorneys for Kueng and Lane pointed out their clients had insufficient training and were subordinate to Chauvin, who was a longtime veteran of the force. \"We don't need commanders to tell us that if someone has seniority over you, you listen to them,\" Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, told the court Tuesday. \"It's common sense.\"\n\n\"They didn't have to intend to harm Mr. Floyd,\" Assistant US Attorney LeeAnn Bell countered during her rebuttal argument Tuesday. \"They just needed to know they could take certain actions under the law and failed to do so.\"\n\nJurors deliberated for roughly 13 hours over two days before reaching their verdict.\n\nJUST WATCHED How the fatal arrest of George Floyd unfolded Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How the fatal arrest of George Floyd unfolded 04:33\n\nThe officers testified in the trial\n\nDarnella Frazier, the now 18-year-old girl who recorded the cell phone video of Floyd's death, testified she was accompanying her cousin to the Cup Foods store when they encountered officers and a man on the ground who was saying, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\n\"I didn't see George Floyd resist at all,\" Frazier told the court, but added that Chauvin remained on top of him. Frazier testified she saw Floyd's nose bleeding as he became unresponsive and then \"unconscious.\"\n\nEach of the three former officers took the stand to testify about their thoughts and actions during the restraint, a stark contrast from Chauvin's silence during his state trial.\n\nKueng and Lane were the first officers to respond to the Cup Foods store on that day after reports that Floyd had tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill. They later helped Chauvin restrain Floyd -- Kueng held down Floyd's torso while Lane held his legs -- and Thao held back a group of bystanders shouting at the officers to get off Floyd.\n\nThao, the first of the three to testify, told the court he assumed the other officers on the scene were \"taking care\" of Floyd, and that his role transitioned to crowd and traffic control. He testified that he was aware that Lane and Kueng were new officers and said that while he saw Chauvin put a knee to Floyd's neck, it was not uncommon to see Minneapolis officers use their knee when making an arrest. When prosecutors asked Thao during cross-examination why he didn't tell Chauvin to get off Floyd's neck, he said: \"I think I would trust a 19-year veteran to figure it out.\"\n\nPhotos: How George Floyd's death reignited a movement Protesters face off with police during a rally in Minneapolis on May 26.

Kueng testified he was stressed and could not tell how much pressure Chauvin was using with his knee, adding he believed Floyd was still breathing when emergency responders arrived. He told prosecutors during cross-examination that, while he did not have much experience with handling large individuals who were resisting arrest, he was not aware or trained for the \"technique using the leg.\"\n\nLane, the second rookie officer, testified Monday he tried to de-escalate the situation outside the Cup Foods and that when Chauvin arrived, he \"either asked or cut in front of me,\" and later informed Floyd he was under arrest for forgery. Lane testified he asked Chauvin twice if they should reposition Floyd during restraint because he was worried about \"excited delirium\" -- which he defined as \"basically an adrenaline overdose\" -- and Chauvin said no.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Lane said he started CPR about five minutes after Kueng said he could not find a pulse, adding that, ideally, CPR should be started immediately after a pulse cannot be found.", "authors": ["Julia Jones", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/tech/tiktok-depp-heard-trial/index.html", "title": "Johnny Depp, Amber Heard trial Tiktok posts are making accidental ...", "text": "(CNN) TikTok posts about actor Johnny Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, have turned a stay-at-home mom based in Scotland into an accidental influencer. Or, perhaps more aptly, a DeppTok influencer.\n\nSophie Doggett, whose TikTok was previously populated by videos on everyday things such as herself or her pets, posted to her TikTok account on April 25 a clip of Heard's lawyer asking a question of a witness and then immediately objecting to the response. It is one of many moments in the trial that has been seized upon by people like Doggett, as clips of testimony and references to the case have pervaded TikTok in a way that no trial has before. That's partly because the proceeding, set to resume Monday, is being livestreamed during the age of TikTok, and also because of the high-profile celebrities the case involves.\n\nDoggett, who paired the clip to playful music, said she gained 30,000 followers seemingly overnight from the post which has, to date, been viewed more than 5 million times. Asked about her follower count before the viral post, she says it was 6,668, a number she recites by heart. In the three weeks since the post, she's collected more than 25,000 additional followers. Her account is now dedicated to Depp-related posts, some of which pertain to the trial, others to past Depp films or interviews. The top three posts pinned to Doggett's account have more than 14 million collective views.\n\nIf there's any question of where her loyalty lies, it is with Depp, something that's conveyed through the photo associated with her TikTok account — white text against a black background that reads \"Justice for Johnny Depp.\"\n\nInside the courtroom, jurors are tasked with determining whether Depp was falsely and maliciously accused of domestic abuse by Heard, which he claims cost him an estimated $50 million in damages associated with lost acting jobs. The case stems from a 2018 opinion piece published in The Washington Post wherein Heard described herself as \"a public figure representing domestic abuse.\" Although Depp is not named in the piece, Heard refers to the year 2016, a year in which she filed for a divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against Depp, claiming she'd been abused.\n\nTikTok creators are leveraging hashtags like #JusticeforJohnnyDepp to show support for the actor while using others to mock actress Amber Heard.\n\nDepp denied the allegations then, as he does now, and the two reached a divorce settlement that year, issuing a joint statement at the time. During his testimony, Depp alleged he was physically and verbally abused by Heard and denied accusations that he was physically violent toward her. Heard has countersued Depp for $100 million, claiming statements his team made were damaging to her career\n\nOnline, however, everyone from everyday users like Doggett — who said she is now able to monetize her posts through TikTok's creator fund due to the attention — to legal analysts, lifestyle influencers, activists of varying pursuits, and comedians are taking it upon themselves to dissect and analyze every minute detail of the trial, down to conspiracy theories about the way in which Heard dabbed her nose with a tissue.\n\nEmily D. Baker, a former LA deputy district attorney turned online creator, streams live legal commentary of the trial proceedings on her YouTube page, which has more than 330,000 subscribers. Her viewers increasingly request for her to respond to theories or footage they have seen on TikTok, she says.\n\n\"When you have cameras streaming in the courtroom, people are going to clock every strange behavior. And they have,\" said Baker.\n\nMany are in the comment sections on YouTube channels to cheer Depp or jeer Heard — typically in that order. Others have set up their own video broadcasts to provide ongoing commentary of the trial in real-time or devoted Instagram accounts to posting updates on the case. Perhaps most striking — because of the way in which the platform operates and how users take to it — is TikTok.\n\nLike Doggett, two other TikTok users CNN Business spoke with recounted similar stories of going from hundreds or thousands of followers to tens of thousands of followers in a matter of days due to Depp-related posts.\n\nOne TikTok user, who is based in the UK, said she posted a video on April 27 celebrating Depp for freeing his lawyer's snagged charger cord with a comment, \"the little things.\" \"I wasn't expecting anyone to reach out, or like it, or share it even,\" she said, noting that she'd originally created her account to post about films. But it has since garnered more than 10 million views. She's continued posting about the trial and she says her account has gone from fewer than 300 followers to more than 50,000.\n\nMaria Pugsley, also based in the UK, similarly told CNN Business that followers to her account grew from fewer than 10,000 to more than 37,000. Previously, she said her use of TikTok included \"jumping on the trends, really and having a bit of a laugh — it never really took off to be honest.\"\n\nBut users have taken to her commentary on the trial, in which she favors Depp and has spoken about male victims of abuse. \"In the beginning I went in very unbiased — all of my opinions are based on the courtroom,\" she said, adding: \"I am always open to having my opinion changed.\"\n\nA high-profile trial, dissected on TikTok\n\nTikTok's algorithm has been repeatedly reported upon as scary-good in its manner of feeding users more and more posts pertaining to their interests. One has to look no further than the hashtags on TikTok to gauge that sentiment there sways favorable toward the 58-year-old Depp, undoubtedly the bigger celebrity with a much longer history cultivating a fanbase compared to 36-year-old Heard. Doggett noted that she hadn't personally come across posts on TikTok in support of Heard: \"Maybe a couple people [in comments sections] saying 'Team Amber.' They get destroyed in the comments.\"\n\nOne hashtag, #JusticeForJohnnyDepp, has garnered more than 11 billion views globally, while just the actor's name has more than 19 billion, and #JohnnyDeppisInnocent has garnered more than 3 billion. Users are applying filters to their faces to personify Depp, combining clips of testimonies with past footage from Depp's film archives. By contrast, #JusticeForAmberHeard has 41 million views. Heard's name has garnered more than 9 billion views and #AmberTurd has 1.6 billion (a hashtag fueled by trial testimony concerning fecal matter.) Meanwhile, the #AmberHeardIsALiar had drawn more than 2 billion views when CNN Business reviewed it Friday afternoon, but the hashtag no longer appeared viewable in the app as of Friday evening.\n\n\"What you're seeing is fan base versus fan base,\" Juda Engelmayer, a public relations professional who has worked with high-profile figures, such as disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein who was convicted for sex crimes, and is currently working with the fake heiress Anna Sorokin. \"It was surprising to me that the social media throngs and supporters are almost entirely backing him.\"\n\nThe passionate social media posts surrounding the case are, at times, rooted in other factors. Some see outsized support for Depp, and the dismissal of Heard's allegations, as another example of internalized misogyny. Others, including men's rights activists, have lifted up Depp in online forums as a rare well-known man who alleges he experienced domestic abuse at the hands of a woman, thereby bringing light to the issue.\n\nAccording to Daniel Klug, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon University's Institute for Software Research who has researched TikTok's algorithm, \"TikTok creates a sort of mediated reality for the user.\"\n\n\"Over a time period, you see a lot of short videos ... depending on what kind of content you see, let's say a lot of content about the trial, that creates a certain perception of the reality of the trial for you on TikTok,\" he said, noting that posts tends to fall into two categories: those that capture testimonies from Heard, Depp, or others on the stand \"describing very personal and intimate and weird details of their relationship,\" or content related to Depp or the trial that is \"remixed or reinterpreted by other users.\"\n\nCallum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate which recently investigated abuse directed at several high-profile women, including Heard, on Instagram similarly noted that the nature of TikTok is such that \"you get very, very slim segments of the trial presented and usually with a very heavy skew.\"\n\n\"This applies as much to [content posted about] Ukraine as clips of the Amber Heard, Johnny Depp trial,\" said Hood, noting that \"content on TikTok, more so than any other platform, is free of context ... We tend to know less about the account that's posting it, less about when it was posted, less about where the material is from, about the motivations of the person posting it ... I've got a lot of sympathy for the users because it is genuinely very hard, with the information available to you in the app, to understand the context and to make an assessment of how true or false it is.\"\n\nCenter for Countering Digital Hate's report noted that discussions of Depp and Heard's legal battles on social media \"often contain abuse towards Heard, as well as the promotion of conspiracy theories around the rate of women's false allegations of domestic abuse.\"\n\nTrial-related content on TikTok varies from those who are analyzing and conspiracy theorizing to attempts to poke fun, which can quickly become distasteful. One popular variation of posts is based on satirical reenactments using audio from Heard's testimony, in which she said, \"I was walking out of the bedroom, [he] slapped me across the face and I turned to look at him and I said, 'Johnny, you hit me. You just hit me.'\" One widely-shared post, featured a cat role playing the former couple. It wears a blond wig when playing the part of Heard and a paper mustache and bandana when playing the part of Depp. While the original post is no longer viewable, it had been \"dueted\" by other accounts — a TikTok feature that enables users to post a video side-by-side one from another user in order to react to it — which can still be found on the platform.\n\nFor its part, TikTok said it removes content that violates its policies, which include \"threats or degrading statements intended to mock, humiliate, embarrass, intimidate, or hurt an individual.\" There may be some leeway in the case of Heard and Depp, as its community guidelines note that \"critical comments of public figures may be allowed; however, serious abusive behavior against public figures is prohibited.\"\n\n\"I believe I was mass reported over political differences\"\n\nThere are also questions about whether and how others on the platform may be able to silence certain voices or opinions.\n\nOne TikTok user named Ashley, who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy reasons, posted about how she felt some men's rights activists were using the trial as an excuse to discredit allegations by women of abuse.\n\n\"Can you imagine the leeway every narcissistic woman-hating man is going to have now?\" she said in the post. Ashley told CNN Business that the post was quickly \"dueted\" and she received threats in the comments, then her account was banned.\n\nIn a message on April 26, Ashley — who is based in Pittsburgh and had 7,000 followers — asked TikTok to restore her account, \"I believe I was mass reported over political differences,\" she wrote, adding that she had screenshots of threatening messages she had received. Asked about her account by CNN Business last week, TikTok said it would investigate it. Following that, the company restored her account but did not provide any details on why.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}]}

The Chicago and state public health departments announced Illinois' first presumptive case June 2\n\n\"I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and coordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating, and preventing the spread of MPV,\" Pritzker tweeted . \"In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBTQ+ community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.\"\n\nMonkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox, that usually causes pimple- or blister-like lesions, as well as flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills and respiratory symptoms, according to the CDC\n\nThe virus can spread to anyone through close, often skin-to-skin contact , according to the CDC. It's also possible for people to get monkeypox from infected animals.\n\nCalifornia has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses so far and distributed more than 25,000, according to the governor's news release. Los Angeles County has received its own vaccine allocation, and state officials said California will make additional allocations in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,\" the California governor said.\n\nCalifornia has been using testing, contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure built for the Covid-19 pandemic to respond to monkeypox outbreaks, Newsom's office said.\n\nThe CDC has made the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease, but access is limited in California. Now, the treatment can be administered at more than 30 facilities and providers across the state, officials said.\n\nCalifornia has also expanded its monkeypox testing capacity and can process more than 1,000 tests a week, according to Newsom.\n\nThe state's first case of monkeypox was reported May 21 and involved someone who had traveled abroad. Now, there are probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 27 different local health jurisdictions, including a case involving a toddler\n\nIn mid-July, California's health department requested 600,000 to 800,000 additional monkeypox vaccine doses to help expand eligibility to both confirmed and probable exposures, as well as to high-risk individuals.\n\nThe health department is \"hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state's request,\" it said in a news release Friday.\n\nPeople line up to receive the monkeypox vaccine at a vaccination site at the Balboa Sports Center in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on July 27, 2022.\n\nAs of last week, the US Department of Health and Human Services had delivered more than 336,000 doses of Jynneos -- an FDA-approved vaccine created for smallpox and monkeypox -- from the strategic national stockpile.\n\nHealth authorities throughout the country have been focused on education efforts to inform Americans about how monkeypox spreads.\n\nMonkeypox , according to the CDC, can spread via \"respiratory secretions\" and by touching objects contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. Many of the cases in the latest outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, but monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nA large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts on this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact.\n\n\"Our team is also committed to reducing stigma among the LGBTQ community, which has been singled out and treated unfairly because of this outbreak. No single individual or community is to blame for the spread of any virus. Monkeypox can affect anyone as it spreads by skin-to-skin contact, as well as from sharing items like clothing, bedding and towels,\" California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said in a Friday statement.\n\nFollowing the emergency declaration in California, Equality California, a major LGBT rights nonprofit organization, applauded the governor's move, noting in a statement that the virus \"continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men here in California and across the country.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, state Sen.

Across the world, there has now been more than 6,000 cases recorded in 58 countries,\" Tedros said\n\n\"Testing remains a challenge, and it's highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up,\" he added. \"Europe is the current epicenter of the outbreak, recording more than 80% of cases globally.\"\n\nMonkeypox, a viral disease, occurs mostly in central and western Africa, where the virus is endemic -- but as part of the latest outbreak, the virus has spread to many regions of the world where it is not typically seen.\n\nCases are also being reported in African countries that previously were not affected by the virus, and in those places where the virus is endemic, record numbers are being recorded, Tedros said Wednesday. WHO teams are following the data closely, he said.\n\nWHO is working with countries and vaccine manufacturers to coordinate sharing of vaccines for monkeypox, which are scarce. The organization is also working with groups to break the stigma around the virus and spread information to help protect people.\n\n\"I want to particularly commend those that are sharing videos online via social media channels, talking about their symptoms and experiences with monkeypox,\" he said . \"This is a positive way to break down the stigma about a virus that can affect anyone.\"\n\nEarly data on the outbreak has suggested that gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men make up a high number of reported cases, leading to concern about stigmatizing the disease and the LGBTQ community.\n\nHowever, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has the virus can be at risk.\n\nThe monkeypox virus can spread from person to person through direct contact with infectious body fluids or with the rash, scabs and sores that the disease can cause. Spread can also happen through indirect contact, such as through clothing or bedding contaminated with the virus.\n\nIt can also spread through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or during intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.\n\nSymptoms of monkeypox can include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a rash on the skin that can look like pimples or blisters.\n\nThe rash goes through different stages, developing into pustules before healing.\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of vaccine distributed in US\n\nAbout 41,500 courses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos have been distributed to states and other jurisdictions across the United States, according to data published Wednesday by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA course of Jynneos involves two doses four weeks apart.\n\nThe Biden administration announced last week that the strategy for distributing monkeypox vaccines would focus on areas with the highest case rates and overall risk. The District of Columbia has the most reported cases per capita, by far, and has received the most vaccine doses per capita, the new HHS data shows.\n\nVaccine distribution has also been heavily concentrated in California, Illinois and New York, particularly the three largest US cities: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nMassachusetts, Hawaii and Colorado also received a large share of the vaccine distribution to date.\n\nEleven states have not received any monkeypox vaccine, according to the data; none of them has reported any cases to the CDC.\n\nUS monkeypox testing ramps up\n\nEfforts are also underway to ramp up testing for the virus in the US.\n\nThe commercial laboratory company Labcorp will begin monkeypox testing Wednesday at its largest facility in the United States, doubling the nation's capacity to test for the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC announced Wednesday that Labcorp will be able to accept specimens for testing from anywhere in the United States, and the company expects to perform up to 10,000 tests per week.\n\nThe outbreak has led to 605 probable or confirmed cases in the US as of Wednesday evening. Cases have been reported in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Three of the cases were non-US residents.\n\n\"The ability of commercial labs to test for monkeypox is a key pillar in our comprehensive strategy to combat this disease,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday. \"This will not only increase testing capacity but will make it more convenient for providers and patients to access tests by using existing provider-to-lab relationships.\"\n\nIf someone thinks they could have a monkeypox infection, a provider will have to order a test. \"The public will not be able to go to a Labcorp lab and submit a specimen,\" the CDC said in its statement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC's Laboratory Response Network has been conducting most of the monkeypox-specific testing in the US, but on June 22, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that monkeypox testing would expand to five commercial labs: Aegis Science, Labcorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Sonic Healthcare.\n\nThe CDC confirmed Wednesday that it had shipped tests to the labs and that their employees have been trained on how to administer the tests. \"CDC anticipates additional commercial laboratories will come online and monkeypox testing capacity will continue to increase throughout the month of July.\"", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/monkeypox-public-health-emergency/index.html", "title": "Monkeypox: Biden administration declares the outbreak a public ...", "text": "(CNN) The Biden administration on Thursday declared monkeypox a public health emergency, with cases on the rise across the US.\n\nThe announcement came during a briefing with the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe administration has been criticized at times for its handling of the outbreak, and some have called on the government to declare a national emergency without delay.\n\nSince the first US monkeypox case was identified in mid-May, more than 6,600 probable or confirmed cases have been detected in the United States.

The move could make it easier to access federal resources to combat both monkeypox's spread and the stigma against the community of men who have sex with men, who have been predominately impacted by the outbreak, officials say.\n\nMany have criticized the Biden administration for not responding quicker to the monkeypox outbreak, repeating some of the same mistakes that plagued the nation during the early days of COVID-19. But federal officials say that Thursday's move is intended to get ahead of the spread of the once-rare disease.\n\nRepeating history:After repeating early COVID mistakes, US now has the world’s biggest monkeypox outbreak\n\nThursday:Biden administration declares monkeypox a public health emergency\n\n\"We continue to marshal forward the tools we need to make sure we can take on monkeypox and keep it from spreading to the point of becoming endemic,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said.\n\nIn recent weeks, clinics across the country have said they haven’t received enough of the two-shot vaccine to meet demand. On Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that 1.1 million doses had been made available nationwide and that testing capacity was boosted to more than 80,000 each week.\n\nMonkeypox does not usually cause serious illness – however, it can result in hospitalization or death. The virus is spread through close, physical contact. The current outbreak is impacting some populations more than others, notably men who have sex with men, but health officials stress that the virus can infect anyone.\n\nMonkeypox is not a gay disease.

Similar declarations were made for the Zika virus in 2016 in Latin America and the effort to eradicate polio, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nGhebreyesus made the decision despite a lack of consensus among experts, calling himself “a tiebreaker.\"\n\nIt was the first time a U.N. health agency chief has unilaterally made such a decision without an expert recommendation.\n\nThere is \"a clear risk of further international spread,\" Ghebreyesus said in a statement.\n\n\"So in short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little,\" he said. \"For all of these reasons, I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\"\n\nBut some experts have argued that the disease isn’t severe enough to warrant the attention, in part because most people recover without needing medical attention, although the lesions can be excruciating.\n\nSymptoms of the disease begin to appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever, muscle aches, exhaustion and a rash that can appear on the body. So far, monkeypox deaths have been reported only in Africa, where a more dangerous version of the virus is spreading.\n\nA WHO emergency committee decided last month that the outbreak did not at that time represent a public health emergency of international concern, Ghebreyesus said in his statement.\n\nAt the time, 3,040 cases had been reported in 47 countries, he said. Since then, the outbreak has ballooned to more than 16,000 reported cases in more than 70 countries.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. reported its first two cases of monkeypox in children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN:Rising reports of monkeypox cases in US and around the world raise concern\n\nMonkeypox a growing global concern\n\nThe virus has been found in parts of central and west Africa for decades, but monkeypox began to spread more widely in May as authorities reported dozens of outbreaks globally.\n\nAs a more dangerous version of the virus spreads mainly in Nigeria and the Congo, the only monkeypox deaths as of now have been reported in Africa, where it spreads mainly to people from infected animals such as rodents. But in Europe, North America and other regions, monkeypox is spreading from human to human without links to animals or travel to Africa.\n\nLGBTQ leaders say more testing kits, vaccines and additional health workers are needed to limit the outbreak, which is primarily striking gay and bisexual men.\n\nMonkeypox does not exclusively spread through sex, but some experts worry it could soon become an entrenched disease similar to gonorrhea, herpes or HIV.\n\nInforming men who have sex with men about the virus without causing stigma remains a balancing act, because the virus can affect anyone who gets in close contact with monkeypox, regardless of their sexuality.\n\nMonkeypox in the US\n\nThere were 2,891 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the U.S. as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. States reporting cases have received 370,000 vaccine doses.\n\nThe White House promised a robust strategy to combat the virus, including vaccines, testing, treatments and communication with areas where the virus has spread.\n\nSaturday's declaration \"is a call to action\" for health officials around the world, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement, adding, \"We are determined to accelerate our response in the days ahead.\"\n\nNew York has had the most confirmed cases of any state at 900. California, Florida, Georgia and Illinois each have more than 100 cases.\n\nIn New York and San Francisco, demand for vaccines has been exceeding the supply providers have available.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Department of Public Health offers vaccine by invitation only to people who have a known exposure or are at high risk of one.\n\nThe federal government plans to release more than 1.6 million doses of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos by the end of the year, but demand is so high that the 56,000 doses released in June have almost all been used.\n\nThe vaccine protects against monkeypox but can also be given after exposure to prevent illness, according to the CDC.\n\nOnly two U.S. cases have been reported among children, who are described as being in good health and receiving treatment, according to the CDC. How they caught the disease is being investigated, but officials think it was through household transmission.\n\nOlder adults who were vaccinated against smallpox as children probably have some protection against monkeypox, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nWHO recommendations\n\nIn Saturday's statement, Ghebreyesus stressed that countries like the U.S. experiencing human-to-human spread must try to stop that transmission and protect vulnerable groups.\n\nIdentifying cases of monkeypox through testing and then contact-tracing remains key to stopping community spread. Vaccines also are an important strategy, he said.\n\nAs with cases of COVID-19, people who have monkeypox should isolate for as long as they're infectious, the statement said.\n\nVaccines and personal protection equipment are also necessary to help prevent spread among health care workers.\n\nImmunosuppressed people, children and people who are pregnant may be at risk of severe monkeypox disease and should consider vaccines, according to the statement.\n\nGhebreyesus said anyone experiencing possible symptoms or anyone who was in contact with a monkeypox case should avoid all travel until they determine they can do so without possibly spreading the virus.\n\nExperts respond to global emergency declaration\n\nThough some experts questioned whether the declaration would help, others have pushed for the outbreak to be designated a global emergency, wondering why WHO hadn't made this decision earlier.\n\nMichael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said the conditions for declaring monkeypox a global emergency were arguably met weeks ago.\n\n\"I think it would be better to be proactive and overreact to the problem instead of waiting to react when it's too late,\" Head said.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, released a statement Saturday saying it commends the decision.\n\nThe designation is \"critical to rapidly increase testing capacity and vaccine distribution in order to reach communities most impacted by the virus, particularly gay and bisexual men and transgender women, who comprise the majority of current cases,” said Jay Brown, Human Rights Campaign senior vice president of programs, research and training.\n\nDr. Placide Mbala, a virologist who directs the global health department at Congo's Institute of National Biomedical Research, said efforts to stop monkeypox must be equitable, adding that vaccines should be sent to Africa and be made available to those at highest risk, such as hunters in rural areas.\n\n\"Vaccination in the West might help stop the outbreak there, but there will still be cases in Africa,\" he said. \"Unless the problem is solved here, the risk to the rest of the world will remain.\"\n\nContributing: Boris Q'va, Janet Loehrke, Sara Moniuszko, George Petras and Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/new-york-city-monkeypox-public-health-emergency/index.html", "title": "New York becomes second major US city to declare health ...", "text": "(CNN) New York City officials declared monkeypox a public health emergency Saturday, saying the city is the epicenter of the state's outbreak and the move will boost measures to help slow the spread of the disease.\n\n\"We estimate that approximately 150,000 New Yorkers may currently be at risk for monkeypox exposure,\" Mayor Eric Adams and Dr. Ashwin Vasan, commissioner of the city's health and mental hygiene department, said in a joint statement . \"This outbreak must be met with urgency, action, and resources, both nationally and globally, and this declaration of a public health emergency reflects the seriousness of the moment.\"\n\nHealthcare workers with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene help people register for the monkeypox vaccine at a city vaccination site on July 26, 2022.\n\nIt comes just a day after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued an executive order declaring a state disaster emergency, saying \"more than one in four monkeypox cases in this country\" are in the state. Among several other actions, the governor's order expands the number of people eligible to administer monkeypox vaccines, requires providers to send vaccine data to the state's health department and will boost ongoing response efforts including efforts to get more vaccines and expand testing capacity, the governor's office said.\n\nOther leaders in the US -- and across the globe -- have been sounding the alarm over monkeypox as infection numbers continue to rise and vaccine supply is falling short of demand. Experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci have stressed the monkeypox outbreak needs to be taken seriously and handled in a more rigorous manner, while federal officials continue to weigh a nationwide public health emergency declaration.\n\nSan Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency on Thursday in an effort to strengthen its preparedness and response amid \"rapidly rising cases\" and high demand for the vaccine, the city said. The declaration goes into effect on Monday.\n\n\"We know that this virus impacts everyone equally -- but we also know that those in our LGBTQ community are at greater risk right now,\" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement. \"Many people in our LGBTQ community are scared and frustrated. This local emergency will allow us to continue to support our most at-risk, while also better preparing for what's to come.\"\n\nIn Washington, the federal government is continuing to monitor the response to monkeypox and will use it to consider whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency, US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday.\n\n\"We will weigh any decision on declaring a public health emergency based on the responses we're seeing throughout the country. Bottom line is, we need to stay ahead of it and be able to end this outbreak,\" he said.\n\nFormer US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned earlier this month it may be too late to contain the outbreak , telling CBS, \"The window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed.\"\n\nLast weekend, the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern after convening its second emergency committee on the issue.\n\nWHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as \"an extraordinary event\" which constitutes a \"public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and \"to potentially require a coordinated international response.\"", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/health/monkeypox-response-cavalry-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: While monkeypox cases rise, why are we waiting ...", "text": "(CNN) It's hard to believe we are face-to-face with a new health crisis, monkeypox, before we are even out of the woods with the previous -- but still very much current -- crisis, Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, which has held the United States and almost every other country in its grip, should have taught us valuable lessons about how to manage a public health emergency, but it seems we are making some of the same mistakes we made not even three years ago, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus started to spread.\n\nTesting for the monkeypox virus, once very limited, is now more available, but underused. The demand for vaccines is outpacing the supply. There are nearly 2 million courses the highly effective TPOXX antiviral sitting in the Strategic National Stockpile, but many health care providers are still having a hard time getting the medication for their patients.\n\nWe are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, spending more than $4 trillion dollars a year on health care, more per person than anywhere else. With all those resources and technology, it's not as if the United States is incapable of mounting a significant response to an emerging outbreak. And there is little doubt we will eventually do what should have already been done: declare monkeypox a public health emergency , appoint a national coordinator and mount a more significant response. But why do we wait so long, drag our feet and endure so much suffering in the meantime?\n\nAs I have learned over the past few years, there is a significant difference between preparedness and response, even though the two are often conflated. The United States is extraordinarily prepared, ranked No. 1 for pandemic preparedness in the 2021 Global Health Security Index\n\nInstead, we are leading in a different way. As of today, we have the most confirmed cases of monkeypox on the planet, more than 5,000. That is almost 25% of the global numbers, even though we are just under 5% of the world's population.\n\nIt is now clear: Preparedness alone does not guarantee a rapid response. With Covid-19, and now monkeypox, we were too slow to respond. It was as if we are sitting in a turbo-charged Ferrari, capable of massive acceleration, but instead only idling in the driveway.\n\nCavalry culture\n\nOver the past three years, we have witnessed something counterintuitive. It was predominantly wealthy countries that were hit hardest during the Covid-19 pandemic. They had some of the highest death rates, despite their enormous resources.\n\nWhile there are many reasons for this, including misinformation, lack of public trust, and the entangling of public health and politics, I think there is something else, as well: We have adopted what I call a \"cavalry culture.\" We wait for the cavalry to ride in and rescue us, instead of taking smaller preventive steps -- such as establishing modern and reliable data systems, mastering our supply chain along the way, and acting early to head off the outbreak in the first place.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it's because we too often do the same with our personal health matters. According to research published in The Lancet Public Health , nearly half of chronic disease in the United States is mostly preventable, with lifestyle changes. Even knowing that, however, the medical system is set up for the cavalry to come in with expensive medications and high-tech interventions, instead of providing equitable access and incentives for preventative care.\n\nThere are a couple of important axioms in public health. One is, by the time you think you must act to contain an outbreak, it is already too late. And, if you think you are overreacting, you are probably reacting just the right amount. In the case of Covid, and now monkeypox, we seem to have forgotten those basic public health principles. And, the real question now seems to be: When will the government finally hit the gas pedal on our highly tuned Ferrari?\n\nI don't want to suggest any of this is easy. There are significant issues of uncertainty and unpredictability. Much like a hurricane forming at sea, we often don't know exactly where or how hard it will hit. We want to be measured, calm in our response and to cause as little disruption as possible. We want to be thoughtful and gather as much information as is available.\n\nAnd therein lies one of our biggest problems: basic data. I have often wondered, how is it that a numbers-driven, high-tech country like the United States can't get basic data right?\n\nData disaster\n\nAs long as I've been reporting on the Covid pandemic, I have always had to offer the caveat that case numbers are probably off, sometimes wildly so. We have probably never had a clear vision on just how widely the virus was spreading at any given time in the United States, and going into the fall 2022, the situation isn't really any better.\n\nIn early July, the Institute for Health Metrics, a research center at the University of Washington, released a model suggesting that actual Covid-19 cases are seven times higher than reported cases. At times, it seems the tech platforms for Snapchat and Twitter offer more data analytics than the patchwork of state and federal systems that underpin the public health of our country.\n\n\"First, there's a lack of data access needed to understand where disease outbreaks are spreading. This is due to data collection limitations that Congress needs to fix,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHe said there is also a need to update analog systems and connect them to each other -- getting them to speak the same language. Right now, it's the Tower of Babel.\n\n\"Second, we lack sufficient numbers and, in some cases, skills of people and systems at the federal, state and local levels that can deliver services and communicate effectively with communities. Finally, we are in perpetual panic and neglect funding cycles,\" he said.\n\nAs a result of all of the things Frieden is describing, our current data collection and reporting system leaves important information fractured into dozens of states and territories, and thousands of county pieces for the CDC to puzzle together.\n\n\"I have been struck as we at CDC are now conquering another public health challenge -- monkeypox -- as to how little authority we at CDC have to receive the data,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told the Washington Post.\n\nWalensky is talking about basic data, like where the vaccine has gone, who has been vaccinated, whether the vaccine is working, and even monkeypox case data like who is getting infected, their age and race/ethnicity. Why might this be so?\n\n\"States don't routinely share vaccine doses administered data with the federal government -- Covid was really the first time that we were able to successfully put data use agreements in place,\" Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN. Part of the reason is because \"states have laws in place to protect identifiable information.\"\n\nSome information has been getting to the CDC, but it is challenging to get and incomplete. The CDC director told the Washington Post, \"We have been speaking to our state and local partners probably at least three times a week, all of them. ... That is not how you synthesize data. We need ... standardization of those data, and we need to have those data come to us in a standardized fashion so that they can be connected, we can compile them and rapidly report them out. We cannot at CDC collect the data and make informed decisions by calling 64 jurisdictions, and honestly, 3,000 counties.\"\n\nThe CDC is currently working on agreements that would broaden the agency's access to states' data, as they successfully did with Covid. Hannan explained, \"The need to quickly get the [monkeypox] vaccine out left no time to get data sharing agreements in place.\"\n\nBut even if those agreements were in place, it still doesn't mean the states' ability to actually obtain vaccine doses would be made any easier. That's because the states wouldn't be using the same data system for ordering and tracking doses they generally use. Because the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response are in charge of monkeypox vaccine distribution, there would be yet another data system involved.\n\n\"They were asking states to request the vaccine using paper forms and email,\" said Hannan. \"They were asking states to complete forms [with fillable fields] on those who were receiving the vaccine and return these forms to the federal government.\"\n\nThe problem was there weren't even the right fields for the specific questions being asked, such as reason for vaccination or type of exposure or risk, Hannan said. It wasn't that the necessary forms weren't being filled out, it was that they couldn't be filled out because of disparate data platforms.\n\nIt is a baffling level of bureaucracy in the middle of an unfolding outbreak.\n\nTesting, vaccines, therapeutics\n\nAs things stand now, the issues with data collection, testing, vaccines, treatments and communication are sounding a lot like the ones we experienced with Covid-19.\n\nBut, to be clear, monkeypox is not that much like Covid. For now, it seems to spread primarily through sores or lesions during close, personal touch and shared objects like towels and linens, as well as respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact.\n\nThe monkeypox outbreak is also different for another fundamental reason. Unlike with Covid, which was caused by a novel virus, the basic tools already exist either for monkeypox or its close relative, smallpox. We didn't have to build them from scratch. That means we could have had them or put them to better use by now.\n\nTake testing. At the start of the outbreak, testing capability was capped at about 6,000 tests per week, which meant that doctors really had to ration them to a narrow group of people -- primarily a subset of men who have sex with men. Since then, the CDC has partnered with five labs to scale up our capabilities and we should soon be able to process up to 80,000 tests a week. But the tests are being underutilized , according to CNN reporting. Experts blamed the low uptake on several factors, including a lack of awareness among doctors about the virus and the fear of stigma among patients.\n\nSo, just as with Covid, the real scope of the monkeypox outbreak is probably underappreciated. Confirmed or probable cases stand around 5,000, according to CDC data, but the number could be several fold higher.\n\nAnother tool that could be tremendously helpful is testing of wastewater. As we have seen with Covid, it can better define the scope of the outbreak and where it will emerge next. Two months into the outbreak, we still aren't doing this widely for monkeypox.\n\nAnd then there are vaccines. Unlike Covid, where we spent upward of $20 billion to develop, test and distribute vaccines, we already have a vaccine specifically approved for monkeypox.\n\nSupplies were limited and the initial US vaccination strategy focused on known monkeypox cases and their immediate contacts. But the outbreak continued to grow, and the strategy had to change. The count of people eligible for the two-dose Jynneos vaccine has now expanded to an estimated 1.5 million.\n\nWith that same cavalry culture, we are woefully behind in getting those doses to people who want them. At this time, only 336,710 doses have been shipped to states . Ordering only just began for about 800,000 more doses. This scarcity has created long lines in monkeypox hotspots like New York City, which has the highest number of cases in the country.\n\nIt also means that the vaccine, which can be given within 14 days of exposure (but preferably within four) to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, is currently being used more as a treatment -- a post-exposure prophylaxis -- rather than as a real preventive measure.\n\nAs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN, that focus will have to shift.\n\n\"It's very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,\" Fauci said. \"What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure but go well beyond that.\"\n\nIt's a missed opportunity that won't be rectified immediately, even with the soon-to-arrive 786,000 doses announced by HHS this week. Needs will still outstrip supply.\n\nFinally, there is the issue of treatment. The CDC has made the antiviral smallpox treatment tecovirimat, called TPOXX, available to monkeypox patients who have or are at high risk of severe disease under an \"alternate regulatory mechanism.\"\n\nThere are 1.7 million courses of TPOXX stockpiled. But once again, getting the medication to patients who could immediately benefit has proven to be bureaucratically burdensome for both patients and providers.\n\n\"You're talking about a five, six-day time lag to get that medication to you at a local doctor's office, no matter where you are. And the paperwork, and all of the bureaucracy to make that happen is very cumbersome, takes a few hours of your time. And that's the barrier,\" Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the LGBTQ-centered Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, told me recently.\n\nFortunately, those rules were loosened somewhat last week, allowing patients to get treated more quickly and reducing the amount of documentation needed. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration are working to further streamline the process.\n\nIn the meantime, though, patients are suffering. Even though most cases are \"mild,\" they are still uncomfortable, or downright painful, depending on where sores appear. Plus, there is a risk of long-term complications if the pox lesions develop in areas around the eye or GI tract.\n\nAll of these gaps have the hardest hit community on edge.\n\n\"Largely public health officials know how this has spread. They know how to vaccinate people ... we know how to treat it, and we know how to prevent it,\" says Samuel Garrett-Pate, managing director of external affairs of Equality California, the largest statewide LBGTQ+ civil rights organization.\n\n\"It unfortunately seems that despite two years of building up our public health infrastructure to prevent what happened with Covid-19 from ever happening again, despite the fact that we are better prepared in terms of already having a vaccine available, the CDC and FDA seem to be caught flat-footed once again. And I think as a result, you're seeing very real and understandable fear anxiety among the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nIs it too late?\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current board member of Pfizer, has been pessimistic about the trajectory of monkeypox in the United States.\n\n\"We're now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that's persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed and if it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close,\" he said on Face the Nation on July 17.\n\nCDC's Walensky pushed back on Gottlieb's assessment calling it \"misinformed and off base,\" saying that while it's true there is much work to do, the US has made dramatic progress on priorities like testing, vaccines and education.\n\nThere has been measurable progress in these areas, no doubt. But, I do worry that we once again waited too long. We sat idling in our Ferrari, perhaps not wanting to believe that somehow we had suddenly found ourselves in the middle of yet another outbreak.\n\nI remember when I first saw a case of monkeypox -- it was in 2008, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the handful of countries in Africa where the disease is endemic. To tell you the truth, I never thought I would see it in the United States. After all, it was a virus that hadn't traveled much since it was first identified in DRC in 1970. My guess was that most of my medical colleagues in the United States would likely only see pictures of the distinctive pox lesions in textbooks.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe world, however, is changing, as we have been reminded of twice in the last few years. There are new pathogens emerging, and existing pathogens are more easily traveling the world.\n\nWe have learned painful lessons in the last few years, and we are now in the midst of our first significant test since the Covid pandemic began, to see if we do any better this time around.\n\nThere is no doubt we are capable, and we are prepared.

He's also one of many more who have struggled to find an available vaccine.\n\n\"I just first heard about monkeypox like everybody else, through the news, social media, the grapevine, and how it was becoming something we need to be worried about and how it was predominantly affecting gay men or men who have sex with men,\" Nicolo said.\n\nIt was enough to send him in search of more information on how to protect himself.\n\n\"At the time, there was little resources on finding the vaccine,\" he said.\n\n\"I had two friends reach out with links, and we clicked on them, and they are already completely like -- they were gone immediately. There was no access to anything,\" he said.\n\n\"We just kind of kept an eye on the links and kept on living our lives. And then after Pride weekend is when I started to show symptoms of it -- and that was too late.\"\n\nWhere vaccines are going\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 1.5 million men who have sex with men are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine. Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact and in this outbreak, has mostly been spreading among men who have sex with men.\n\nMore than 132,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine -- a two-dose regimen manufactured by Bavarian Nordic -- have been pulled from the national strategic stockpile and distributed nationwide, according to HHS data , but it hasn't been enough to meet demand.\n\n\"We got an allotment of 200 vaccines, and the appointments for that went in about an hour and a half,\" said Dr. David Holland, chief clinical officer of the Fulton County, Georgia, Board of Health.\n\nThe CDC says decisions about how to allocate the limited vaccine supply are based equally on the number of cases and the population at risk in a specific area.\n\nThe Jynneos vaccine is available now for people at high risk of exposure: those who have been identified as close contacts of someone who has been diagnosed with monkeypox, those who have had sex with a partner diagnosed with monkeypox within the past 14 days, and those who have had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area with monkeypox spread, according to the CDC.\n\nAs more vaccines become available, the agency will continue to evaluate the distribution strategy, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe District of Columbia has received the most vaccines per capita, by far, and the city has many more confirmed cases per capita than any state.\n\nBut as of Wednesday, two states with confirmed cases -- New Mexico and South Dakota -- have yet to receive any doses.\n\nAfter DC, New York has received the most vaccine doses per capita: more than three times the US average. About three-quarters of the state's supply went to New York City.\n\nIn a letter on Tuesday, New York Mayor Eric Adams urged the Biden administration to increase the vaccine allocation, calling his city an \"epicenter\" of the virus in the US.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Wednesday that additional monkeypox vaccine doses will be arriving within weeks from a plant in Denmark.\n\n\"The issue is, we need to get more vaccines out there,\" he said.\n\n\"We are incredibly focused on making sure that vaccine doses get to the United States and get out to places like New York City. Do we wish we had more doses? Of course. We had a stockpile, and what we need is more. We are getting more.\"\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine, says \"the problem is, we simply don't have enough vaccine. So we're trying to play catch-up.\"\n\nThere are also other issues to be considered, he said.\n\n\"I think the challenge is that we need to make sure that the vaccine doesn't go just to the people that are savvy and can get it quickly. We don't want the vaccine only to go to white wealthy individuals.\"\n\nCould a single-dose strategy be helpful?\n\nA full course of the Jynneos vaccine, as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, requires two doses given four weeks apart. But some experts say that one dose might be enough for now -- and that delaying second doses might be a way to address the discrepancy between supply and demand.\n\nIn his letter, Adams called for the administration to \"consider alternative vaccine schedules, utilizing a longer interval between the first and second dose, that would allow more of the immediately available vaccine to be used for first doses.\"\n\nBavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin told Science in early July that \"There are a lot of data to support a single shot.\"\n\nChaplin said the second dose could be given two years later and still achieve the same immune response as the standard schedule, so countries have a long time to provide second shots if they decide to use single shots for now.\n\nHealth experts say providers are not expected to hold back doses right now.\n\n\"From what we've been told, it's: Give the doses you have, and in your later allocations, there'll be additional doses that will cover second doses,\" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.\n\nNot a sustainable strategy\n\nIf the virus isn't contained as soon as possible, health officials fear, it could spread beyond the population groups that are now at high risk.\n\nJanet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, says the US must get past a vaccine strategy focused on high-risk post-exposure because \"there is no vaccine-preventable disease that exists that can be controlled solely post-exposure when there is no prior immunity.\"\n\nMonkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, but it is essentially a new disease to the US, and there is no immunity built up in the population.\n\n\"Everyone is susceptible at this point in time,\" Hamilton said. \"There's no way we will ever be able to control this disease in a completely susceptible population without a pre-exposure vaccine strategy.\"\n\nA need for more and easier testing\n\nIn the meantime, people affected by the virus say they need other resources, as well. The Biden administration has moved to expand testing, with the CDC announcing a collaboration with five private companies to double the nation's testing capacity. Some of those companies have already begun offering testing. But that didn't happen soon enough for some.\n\nNicolo said that when he first went to his doctor with monkeypox symptoms, they took a sample to test -- but he learned days later that it had been discarded, untested.\n\nTwo days after that visit, his symptoms worsened, and he returned to the doctor. The second sample tested positive.\n\nChristian Redondo, a graduate student in Atlanta, noticed a sore and called his local board of health, which said it wasn't doing testing and referred him to his primary care doctor.\n\nHis primary care doctor told him to go to the emergency room to get tested, but Redondo was able to contact a friend at his county health department who said yes, in fact, he would need to go there for a test.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Then, I was in the waiting room for, I don't know, something like four or five hours. It was a very long time. And when I was asking them about it, they said they had to wait for permission from the CDC to even test me for monkeypox,\" he said.\n\nTesting is necessary to prevent further cases and learn more about the full scope of the outbreak.\n\n\"I think one of the challenges that we have is that we're simply not doing enough testing, so there probably are much more cases than we actually are currently registering,\" Emory's del Rio said.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/01/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html", "title": "The Covid-19 case surge is altering daily life across the US.

The high case count is already causing disruptions in the country.\n\nIn New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is plagued with staffing issues and announced three subway lines -- the B, Z and W -- which service various parts of the boroughs, have been suspended.\n\n\"Like everyone in New York, we've been affected by the COVID surge. We're running as much train service as we can with the operators we have available,\" the MTA wrote on Twitter Thursday.\n\nNew York continues to break its own record, adding 85,476 reported Covid-19 cases, according to Saturday's briefing from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nHospitalizations jumped to 8,451, up from around 8,000 in the report released Friday, according to the latest data. The state's seven-day positivity rate is 19.79%.\n\nThe number of one day case additions has increased 219% since Monday, when the state reported an addition of 26,737 cases.\n\nHealthcare services -- exhausted after several surges of the virus and now stretched thin again by a growing number of Covid-19 patients -- are also already feeling impacts. The University of Maryland Capital Region Health this week joined a growing list of medical centers in the state to activate emergency protocols after a sharp rise in cases fueled staffing shortages and overwhelmed emergency departments.\n\n\"The current demand for care is depleting our available resources, including staffing,\" UM Capital Region Health said in a statement on Friday.\n\nIn Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday announced the deployment of about 1,250 National Guard members as hospitals struggle with staffing shortages.\n\nOn the same day, the mayor of Cincinnati declared a state of emergency due to staffing shortages in the city's fire department following a rise in Covid-19 infections. The mayor's declaration said if the staffing problem goes unaddressed, it would \"substantially undermine\" first responders' readiness levels.\n\n\"Get ready. We have to remember, in the next few weeks, there's going to be an unprecedented number of social disruptions,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor University's National School of Tropical Medicine, told CNN.\n\nThose include flight disruptions as well, he said, because of TSA agent and air crew absences.\n\nThousands of flights have already been canceled or delayed throughout the holiday season as staff and crew called out sick. On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration said an \"increased number\" of its employees were testing positive for the virus, and \"to maintain safety, traffic volume at some facilities could be reduced, which might result in delays during busy periods.\"\n\nPrevious rules of virus are 'out the window'\n\nThe virus is now \"extraordinarily contagious\" and previous mitigation measures that used to help now may not be as helpful, CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN on Friday.\n\n\"At the beginning of this pandemic... we all were taught, you have a significant exposure if you're within six feet of somebody and you're in contact with them for more than 15 minutes. All these rules are out the window,\" Reiner said. \"This is a hyper-contagious virus.\"\n\nNow, even a quick, transient encounter can lead to an infection, Reiner added, including if someone's mask is loose, or a person quickly pulls their mask down, or an individual enters an elevator in which someone else has just coughed.\n\n\"This is how you can contract this virus,\" Reiner said.\n\nThe variant's transmissibility helps explain the staggering number of infections reported globally, including in the US. in the past week, several states have reported new case and hospitalization highs, shattering previous records.\n\nNew Jersey recorded more than 28,000 new Covid-19 cases through PCR testing, Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter Friday. In a news conference, the governor said the number was roughly \"quadruple from just two weeks ago, and four times as many cases than during the height of last winter's surge.\"\n\n\"Our hospitals right now are at roughly the same numbers they were on the worst day of last winter's surge,\" he added. \"The problem is that right now we don't see any sign of let up.\"\n\nOther states, including Arkansas, Maryland and New York, also reported new records for case numbers.\n\nAnd a sharp rise in infections -- especially in children -- could soon lead to a spike in hospital admissions, infectious diseases expert Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo said.\n\n\"The explosive rise in cases is really fueling what normally might be a relatively small proportion ... of kids who are experiencing these severe outcomes,\" she told CNN's Amara Walker on Friday. \"But you put the gigantic numbers of cases together with the small number affected, plus the proportion of unvaccinated, and I'm really worried that we're going to be in for a tidal wave of admissions, particularly for kids in the coming weeks.\"\n\nChild Covid-19 hospital admissions already reached an all-time high this week , with a record average of 378 children admitted to hospitals on any given day over the week ending December 28, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nChildren younger than 5 are not yet eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine, and a shot for those groups likely won't be available until mid-2022, experts say.\n\nConcerns about returning to school\n\nWith the virus spreading, some staff members and experts are expressing concern about what school reopenings could mean.\n\n\"There will be pediatric hospitalizations,\" Hotez said. \"And what's going to be the other tough piece in the next weeks, keeping the schools open, because of this high transmissibility -- especially if you start seeing absences of school teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria staff.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Teachers Association, New England's largest public sector union, urged the state education commissioner this week to keep schools closed on Monday, except for staff Covid-19 testing.\n\n\"Using Monday as a day for testing and analyzing data will allow our school districts to make prudent decisions around staffing needs so they can continue in-person learning for students if it is safe or develop contingency plans if a district deems it to be necessary,\" Merrie Najimy, the association's president, said in a statement.\n\nThe state's Executive Office of Education said Friday schools will be open on Monday, despite the teacher union's request.\n\n\"The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education worked hard this week to make at-home rapid tests available to all public school teachers and staff in light of the testing shortages being experienced around the country. Massachusetts is one of only a handful of states supplying rapid tests to its teachers. It is a not a requirement for teachers to return to work, or necessary to reopen schools after the holiday break,\" Colleen Quinn, a spokesperson for the office, said in a statement.\n\n\"It is disappointing,\" the statement added, \"that once again the MTA is trying to find a way to close schools, which we know is to the extreme detriment of our children.\"\n\nAtlanta Public Schools (APS) announced all district schools will operate virtually through Friday, January 7, for all students and staff, according to a statement on Saturday.\n\nCiting the surging Covid-19 cases, APS said the district elected to postpone in-person learning until Monday, January 10. The move will allow students and staff to be tested and if needed, to isolate and quarantine, per CDC and Department of Health Guidelines, according to APS.\n\nAll APS staff members are required to report to their workplaces on Monday for Covid-19 testing, the statement said.\n\nNeighboring Fulton County Schools and DeKalb County Schools also announced Saturday they are starting online next week as students return to classes after the holiday break, according to verified tweets from both districts.\n\nFulton and DeKalb also aim to return to in-person instruction on January 10.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of colleges and universities across the country are making changes to the beginning of the 2022 spring semester as a result of the case surge.\n\nDuke University extended its plan for remote classes by another week because of an \"incredibly high\" positive case count among faculty and an increasing number of cases among students who are already in the area, the school said Friday.\n\nMichigan State University announced Friday that classes will start primarily remotely on January 10 and will stay remote for at least three weeks.\n\n\"I realize that students prefer to be in person, and so do I,\" Samuel L.

More than 100 other hospitals said they anticipate a shortage within the next week.\n\nThe US health care system is Jha's greatest concern, he said, noting the Omicron surge could hamper its capacity to care for patients suffering from conditions other than Covid-19.\n\n\"The health care system is not just designed to take care of people with Covid ... it's designed to take care of kids with appendicitis and people who have heart attacks and get into car accidents,\" he said.\n\n\"And all of that is going to be much, much more difficult because we have a large proportion of the population that is not vaccinated, plenty of high risk people who are not boosted,\" he said. \"That combination sets up a large pool of people who as they get infected will end up really straining the resources we have in the hospitals today.\"\n\nThese staff shortages are growing as frontline health care workers are either infected or forced to quarantine due to exposure to Covid-19 just as the demand for treatment skyrockets: More than 138,000 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals as of Saturday, according to the Department of Health and Human Services . That's not far from the all-time peak (about 142,200 in mid-January 2021) and an increase from around 45,000 in early November.\n\nTo safeguard hospital capacity, some facilities are forced to cut elective surgeries . In New York, for example, 40 hospitals -- mainly in the Mohawk Valley, Finger Lakes and central regions -- have been told to stop nonessential elective operations for at least two weeks because of low patient bed capacity, the state health department said Saturday.\n\nThe University of Kansas Health System is also close to implementing crisis standards of care, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Steven Stites said Saturday, telling CNN, \"At some point ... we're too overwhelmed to do any of our normal daily work.\"\n\n\"At that point we have to turn on a switch that says we got to triage the people we can help the most,\" he said, \"and that means we've have to let some people die who we might have been able to help but we weren't sure about -- they were too far gone or had too much of an injury, or maybe we can't get to that trauma that just came in.\"\n\nStites said two waves were hitting Kansas simultaneously -- with Delta accelerating post-Thanksgiving, to be met by Omicron -- describing it as \"almost a double pandemic.\" The vast majority of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated, Stites said.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, told CNN on Saturday the next several weeks will \"look bad in many American cities.\"\n\n\"Forty hospitals in New York just canceled elective procedures.

As of Saturday, the seven-day average of new daily cases in the US was 701,199, per JHU data.\n\nTwo healthcare providers told CNN they'd been forced to prioritize Covid-19 testing for certain people due to a spike in demand.\n\nLast week, multiple UW Medicine locations in Washington started prioritizing testing solely for people \"who have symptoms of respiratory illness or who have a known exposure to COVID-19,\" spokesperson Susan Gregg told CNN. People without symptoms are not being tested, Gregg said, \"due to the high volume of omicron cases that are being processed in our laboratory.\"\n\nThe University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill is also restricting Covid-19 tests to those exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms, as well as university employees and those requiring a test prior to a surgery, according to UNC Health Director of News Alan M. Wolf.\n\nSome localities are now seeing the most new cases they've seen the whole pandemic, including Los Angeles County.\n\nOn Saturday, the county reported more than 200,000 confirmed cases over the previous seven days -- the highest number of cases in one week since the start of the pandemic, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health . Hospitalizations doubled over the week to 3,200 and there were 135 Covid-related deaths, the department said.\n\nThe rise in infections is also hitting Los Angeles' children hard.\n\nAt Children's Hospital Los Angeles, the positivity rate for children tested for Covid-19 has increased from 17.5% in December to 45% to date in January, according to CHLA Medical Director Dr. Michael Smit.\n\nCHLA currently has 41 patients in-house who have tested positive for Covid-19, and roughly one quarter of the children admitted to the facility with Covid-19 require admission to the pediatric ICU, with some requiring intubation, Smit told CNN on Saturday.\n\nThe rise in cases comes just as Los Angeles students are preparing to return to in-person classes Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles Unified School District, the second-largest school district in the country, is requiring all students and employees to show a negative Covid-19 test result before returning to the classroom.\n\nThe baseline test requirement was implemented at the beginning of the school year in August, and the district announced a week ago both the baseline test, along with required weekly testing for employees and students would continue through January, given the current surge.\n\nOn Sunday, LAUSD Board of Education President Kelly Gonez said about 50,000 positive Covid-19 cases had been identified as a result of the required testing, stopping those students and employees from enter school buildings Tuesday.\n\nDisputes over in-person learning\n\nIn response to rising pediatric infections, disputes over whether in-person learning is ideal during the Omicron surge and how students can safely attend school are playing out in various school districts this week.\n\nFor the week ending December 30, children accounted for 17.7% of new reported cases in the US, the American Academy of Pediatrics said, noting a record 325,00 new cases among children -- a 64% increase from the week prior.\n\nto teach remotely due to the Covid-19 surge, but the school district canceled classes, saying schools were safe and it wanted in-person learning. The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system has canceled classes since Wednesday due to a dispute between city officials and the teachers union over returning to the classroom. The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) voted Tuesdayto teach remotely due to the Covid-19 surge, but the school district canceled classes, saying schools were safe andit wanted in-person learning.\n\nCTU have said conditions are unsafe, citing in part inadequate staffing and testing.

The White House has said it is up to the House speaker where she travels.\n\nStill, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said he'd discussed a visit to Asia with Pelosi.\n\nThe administration takes extra care for Pelosi's security when she travels overseas because she is in the presidential line of succession.\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi's trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn't completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi's potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi's visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats.

She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama -- the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, \"To those who died for democracy.\" In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19 , urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.\n\n\"I would say there's been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,\" Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress' US-China working group, told CNN. \"I just don't think it's their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.\"\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in \"regular contact\" with members of Congress, including Larsen.\n\n\"On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,\" Pengyu said. \"The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.\"\n\n\"We hope serious consequences could be avoided,\" he added. \"This is in the common interests of both China and the US.\"\n\nMany Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi's right to travel to Taiwan.\n\n\"It is Speaker Pelosi's decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,\" said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen's Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. \"In our democratic system -- we operate with separate but equal branches of government.\"\n\n\"It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,\" he added.\n\nOther members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has \"always supported Taiwan.\"\n\nBut when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, \"You could look at it two ways.

Even after she landed, her office did not release an official itinerary for her stay in Taiwan. Taiwan’s three largest national newspapers, citing unidentified sources, said she would spend the night there.\n\nTaiwan's tallest building, Taipei 101, was lit up with welcome messages for the speaker. \"Welcome to TW,\" one message said. \"Thank you,\" read another.\n\nLast month, President Joe Biden said, \"The military thinks it’s not a good idea right now\" for Pelosi to make the trip. Some expressed concern that China could ramp up aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n\"The response will almost certainly include a military component,\" M. Taylor Fravel, director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a thread on Twitter. He said China would probably mount a \"show of force,\" possibly including live fire exercises and a greater military presence within the Taiwan Strait, along with economic and diplomatic actions targeting the island.\n\nReuters, citing an unnamed source, reported Tuesday that several Chinese warplanes flew close to the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait on Tuesday morning and that several Chinese warships have sailed near the line since Monday.\n\nChina views Taiwan as part of its territory, though Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country. The United States has long embraced a murky middle ground that seeks to support Taiwan without infuriating Beijing.\n\nIn an op-ed published in The Washington Post after her arrival, Pelosi said her trip should be seen as \"an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom.\"\n\n\"By traveling to Taiwan, we honor our commitment to democracy: reaffirming that the freedoms of Taiwan – and all democracies – must be respected,\" she wrote.\n\nPelosi, White House: Visit doesn't change US policy on Taiwan\n\nPelosi noted that her visit was one of several congressional delegations to Taiwan, and \"it in no way contradicts longstanding United States policy.\"\n\nWhite House officials emphasized that Pelosi's trip doesn't change the U.S. stance on Taiwan and said there's no reason for the visit to cause any escalation of friction.\n\n\"Nothing about this potential visit ... would change the status quo, and the world should reject any (Chinese) effort to use it to do so,\" said John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications at the White House. \"We will not take the bait or engage in saber rattling.\"\n\nKirby noted that other members of Congress have visited Taiwan, including this year.\n\n\"We have repeatedly said that we oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side, we have said that we do not support Taiwan independence, and we have said that we expect cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means,\" Kirby said.\n\nMore than two dozen Senate Republicans released a joint statement after Pelosi's arrival in Taiwan, voicing their support for her visit.\n\n\"This travel is consistent with the United States’ One China policy to which we are committed,\" they said.\n\nChina's threats\n\nDespite the administration's insistence that the visit does not mark a change in U.S. policy, China has threatened consequences for Pelosi's visit.\n\nIn Tuesday's statement, China's Foreign Ministry said Beijing \"will definitely take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the U.S. speaker's visit.\" Any consequences from those steps \"must be borne by the U.S. side and the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces,\" the statement reads.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping delivered a stark warning directly to Biden over the issue during a lengthy phone call July 28.\n\n\"Those who play with fire will perish by it,\" the Chinese leader said, according to Beijing's official account of the conversation. \"It is hoped that the U.S. will be clear-eyed about this. The U.S. should honor the one-China principle,\" the Chinese government statement said.\n\nU.S. officials have called such comments escalatory.\n\n\"Rhetoric of that kind only escalates tensions in a completely unnecessary manner,\" Kirby said last week.\n\nPelosi's Asia trip\n\nPelosi's visit to Taiwan is part of a congressional delegation to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan.\n\nDemocratic Reps.

In response, the Taiwanese military issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor the activities, it added.\n\nChina frequently sends warplanes into Taiwan's self-declared ADIZ. The highest number of incursions ever recorded was on October 4 last year, when 56 military planes flew into the area on the same day. An ADIZ is unilaterally imposed and distinct from sovereign airspace, which is defined under international law as extending 12 nautical miles from a territory's shoreline.\n\nUS ambassador summoned\n\nChina's anger was underlined when Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xie Feng summoned the US Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, late on Tuesday evening local time to protest the visit, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported on Wednesday.\n\nXie accused Pelosi of \"deliberately provoking and playing with fire against people's will,\" saying her visit is \"extremely egregious\" and the consequences will be \"extremely serious.\"\n\n\"Anyone who attempts to manipulate the Taiwan issue to gain political gain ... will eventually be nailed to the pillar of shame in history,\" Xie said, according to the state media report.\n\nTaiwan's foreign ministry welcomed Pelosi on Tuesday evening. \"It is believed that the visit of Speaker Pelosi and other heavyweight members of Congress will strengthen the close and friendly relationship between Taiwan and the United States and further deepen cooperation between the two sides in various fields globally,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nTaipei Mayor Ko Wen-je also embraced Pelosi's visit but cautioned that the self-governing island should avoid being put \"between a rock and hard place\" in US-China relations.\n\n\"Taiwan should keep its own agency. We are friends with the US and Japan, and we don't have to be on bad terms with China,\" Ko said in a statement. \"Taiwan is in between the US and China. We should keep an open communication channel with China and the US to effectively avoid crises.\"\n\nPelosi to meet with Taiwan's president Wednesday\n\nThe House speaker is expected to visit Taiwan's presidential office and parliament on Wednesday morning (local time), a senior Taiwanese official told CNN. She will first visit the parliament before heading to the presidential office for a meeting with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, the official said.\n\nPelosi is expected to depart Taiwan later on Wednesday, according to a news release issued by the foreign ministry. The official was not authorized to speak about Pelosi's travel plans that have not been publicized.\n\nPelosi is traveling with House Foreign Affairs Chairman Gregory Meeks of New York, Veterans' Affairs Chairman Mark Takano of California and Reps. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Andy Kim of New Jersey.\n\nThe American Institute in Taiwan said Pelosi's delegation will meet with senior Taiwanese leaders \"to discuss US-Taiwan relations, peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights, democratic governance, and other significant issues of mutual interest.\"\n\nPelosi wrote an op-ed that published in The Washington Post after she landed Tuesday, arguing that her trip demonstrated the US commitment to Taiwan under threat from China. \"In the face of the Chinese Communist Party's accelerating aggression, our congressional delegation's visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom,\" the California Democrat wrote.\n\nPelosi's stop in Taiwan was not listed on the itinerary of her congressional visit to Asia, but the stop had been discussed for weeks in the lead up to her trip. The potential stop prompted warnings from China as well as the Biden administration, which has briefed the speaker about the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Pelosi's trip was consistent with US policy on Taiwan, and that the US would be watching China's actions closely after Pelosi leaves.\n\n\"Obviously, we're going to be watching this closely. There is no reason for this visit to become a spurring event for a crisis or a conflict or for a pretext that the Chinese might try to whip up for some sort of military action,\" National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said on CNN's \"At this Hour with Kate Bolduan\" on Tuesday.\n\nPhotos: Nancy Pelosi's history standing up to China House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen arrive for a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan, on Wednesday, August 3.

Although not included in her official itinerary, expectations that she was planning a visit to Taiwan have fueled US-China tensions since reports of her trip emerged last month.\n\nIn a statement after landing, Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said the visit \"honors America's unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan's vibrant democracy.\"\n\nPelosi, a forthright critic of Beijing, has previously said it is important for the US to show support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has lashed out at the visit. In a statement following Pelosi's arrival, China's Foreign Ministry said the trip would have a \"severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations.\"\n\n\"China will definitely take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the US Speaker's visit,\" the statement said.\n\nA spokesman for China's Ministry of Defense said the People's Liberation Army was \"on high alert\" and would launch \"a series of targeted military operations to counteract the situation, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart the interference of external forces and 'Taiwan independence' secessionist schemes.\"\n\nPrior to the visit, US officials had been worried that China could respond militarily, potentially triggering the worst cross-strait crisis in decades. Last week, China's Defense Ministry warned: \"If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by.\"\n\nThe tensions provided the backdrop for a lengthy phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, in which Xi warned the US not to \"play with fire\" on the Taiwan issue. Neither side immediately confirmed if Pelosi's reported plans were discussed, though a US official later confirmed they were. Preparation for the call predated reports of the trip.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the high-stakes visit.\n\nWhy is Beijing angry about Pelosi's visit?\n\nChina's ruling Communist Party claims the self-ruled democracy of Taiwan as its own territory -- despite never having governed it -- and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunify\" the island with the Chinese mainland.\n\nFor decades, Beijing has sought to isolate Taipei on the world stage, from chipping away at its diplomatic allies to blocking it from joining international organizations.\n\nAny move that appears to lend Taiwan a sense of international legitimacy is strongly opposed by China. And in the eyes of Beijing, high-profile overseas visits by Taiwanese officials, or visits by foreign officials to Taiwan, will do just that.\n\nIn 1995, a visit by Taiwan's then-President Lee Teng-hui to the United States triggered a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Enraged by the trip, China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan, and the crisis ended only after the US sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area in a forceful show of support for Taipei.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has received a flurry of visits by US delegations, consisting of sitting and retired officials and lawmakers. That has drawn angry responses from China, including sending warplanes into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone.\n\nBut Pelosi's political stature makes her visit all the more provocative to Beijing.\n\n\"Pelosi is the third public official in the line of succession after the President and Vice President, I think the Chinese take that very seriously,\" said Susan L. Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego.\n\n\"So she is a very important figure in American politics. It's different from your ordinary member of Congress.\"\n\nPelosi is a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has denounced Beijing's human rights record, and met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama -- the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government.\n\nIn 1991, Pelosi unfurled a banner in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters. More recently, she has voiced support for the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong\n\nWhy is the trip fueling US-China tensions?\n\nBeijing sees Pelosi's trip as a \"serious violation\" of historical US-China agreements governing their relations.\n\nThe US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 -- but has long trod a delicate middle path. Washington recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China, but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe US also supplies Taiwan with defensive weaponry under the terms of the decades-old Taiwan Relations Act, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion -- a policy known as \"strategic ambiguity.\"\n\nChina's authoritarian turn under Xi's leadership and plummeting relations with Washington have pulled Taiwan closer into the orbit of the US. This has infuriated Beijing, which has accused Washington of \"playing the Taiwan card\" to contain China's rise.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has stepped up its engagement with Taiwan, approving arms sales and sending delegations to the island.\n\nSince the Taiwan Travel Act was signed into law by then-US President Donald Trump in March 2018, US officials and lawmakers have embarked on more than 20 trips to the island, according to a CNN tally. The 2018 law encourages visits between officials of the US and Taiwan at all levels.\n\nTaiwan figured prominently in Xi and Biden's two-hour-and-17-minute phone call, with the Chinese leader urging Washington to honor existing agreements with Beijing both \"in word and in deed,\" according to a readout from China's Foreign Ministry. The statement added that China would \"resolutely safeguard\" its national sovereignty.\n\nFor his part, Biden reiterated that US policy \"had not changed,\" according to a White House readout of the call.\n\n\"The United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\" Biden said, according to the statement.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58\n\nHas a US House speaker ever visited Taiwan?\n\nPelosi's trip isn't the first time a sitting US House speaker has visited Taiwan.\n\nIn 1997, Newt Gingrich visited Taipei only days after his trip to Beijing and Shanghai. China's Foreign Ministry criticized Gingrich after his Taiwan visit, but the response was limited to rhetoric.\n\nFormer US House Speaker Newt Gingrich meets with Taiwanese Vice President and Premier Lien Chan during a brief visit to Taiwan in April, 1997.\n\nBut twenty-five years on, China is stronger, more powerful and confident, and its leader Xi has made it clear that Beijing will no longer tolerate any perceived slights or challenge to its interests.\n\n\"China is in a position to be more assertive, to impose costs and consequences to countries that don't take China's interest into consideration in their policymaking or actions,\" said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nBut the decision not to include Taiwan on the official itinerary released by the delegation \"preserves the unofficial nature of the visit,\" and should be a \"good outcome for Beijing and US-China relations,\" Thompson added on Twitter following the release of Pelosi's statement Sunday listing her itinerary.\n\nWhat about the timing?\n\nPelosi's visit comes at a sensitive time for China.\n\nThe House speaker had previously planned to lead a US congressional delegation to Taiwan in April, but postponed the trip after she tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe Chinese military celebrated its founding anniversary on August 1, while Xi, the country's most powerful leader in decades, is preparing to break conventions and seek a third term at the Communist Party's 20th congress this fall.\n\nIn August, Chinese leaders are also expected to gather in the seaside resort of Beidaihe for their annual summer conclave, where they discuss personnel moves and policy ideas behind closed doors.\n\n\"It's a very tense time in Chinese domestic politics,\" Shirk said. \"(Xi) himself and many other members of the elite in China would view the Pelosi visit as a humiliation of Xi Jinping (and) his leadership. And that means that he will feel compelled to react in a way to demonstrate his strength.\"\n\nWhile the politically sensitive timing could trigger a stronger response from Beijing, some experts believe it could also mean the Communist Party would want to ensure stability and prevent things from getting out of control.\n\n\"Honestly, this isn't a good time for Xi Jinping to provoke a military conflict right before the 20th party congress. It's in Xi Jinping's interest to manage this rationally and not instigate a crisis on top of all the other crises he has to deal with,\" Thompson said, citing China's slowing economy, deepening real estate crisis, rising unemployment, and constant struggle to curb sporadic outbreaks under its zero-Covid policy.\n\nHow has China reacted?\n\nChina's military will start exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the self-governed island and launch a series of \"targeted military operations to counteract the situation,\" according to statements released by its Eastern Theater Command and Ministry of Defense Tuesday.\n\n\"Starting from the evening of August 2, the Eastern Theater Command will carry out a series of joint military operations around Taiwan Island, and conduct joint air and sea exercises in the sea and air spaces of the northern, southwestern and south-eastern Taiwan Island, conduct long-range live ammunition firing in the Taiwan Strait, and organize regular-guided-fire testing in the eastern waters of Taiwan Island,\" Col. Shi Yi, spokesman for the Eastern Theater Command, said.\n\n\"This action is a solemn deterrent against the recent major escalation of the negative actions of the United States on the Taiwan issue, and a serious warning to 'Taiwan independence' forces,\" the statement added.\n\nThe Eastern Theater is one of the five joint commands of the People's Liberation Army with jurisdiction over China's eastern coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, which sit opposite and above Taiwan.\n\nJUST WATCHED China sends warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone amid Pelosi's visit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China sends warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone amid Pelosi's visit 02:33\n\nPrior to her arrival, national security officials quietly worked to convince Pelosi of the risks her trip to Taiwan could pose, while the Pentagon developed a security plan to use ships and aircraft to keep her safe.\n\nThe constant worry among US officials is that miscalculations or inadvertent incidents or accidents could occur if China and the US significantly increase their air and maritime operations in the region.\n\nBut US does not expect direct hostile action from Beijing during a visit by Pelosi. At least five defense officials, speaking prior to her arrival, described this as a very remote possibility and said the Pentagon wants to see the public rhetoric lowered.\n\nWhat has Taiwan said about Pelosi's trip?\n\nPelosi was welcomed at the airport by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, and the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper was lit up with a welcome message for the speaker praising \"US-Taiwan friendship forever.\"\n\nTaiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen will receive Pelosi and her delegation at the Presidential Palace on the morning of August 3, according to a statement from the president's office.\n\nPresidential Spokesperson Xavier Chang said that Speaker Pelosi had not only supported Taiwan for a long time, but also paid attention to Taiwan's democratic development and regional peace and security.\n\nBut prior to her arrival, Taiwan had been tight-lipped about the situation. When Pelosi's visit was first reported by the Financial Times last week, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had \"received no information\" about the visit.\n\nDuring a regular news briefing on Thursday, a ministry spokeswoman reiterated it had not received any definite information on whether Pelosi would be visiting the island and had \"no further comment\" on the matter.\n\n\"Inviting members of the US Congress to visit Taiwan has long been a focus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan and our Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States,\" spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.\n\nThough international media is closely watching events, the escalating tension barely made headline news in Taiwan this week. Taiwan's media has mostly focused on upcoming local elections and Taiwanese military drills.\n\nPreviously, Taiwanese officials have publicly welcomed visits by US delegations, seeing them as a sign of support from Washington.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan", "Selina Wang", "Eric Cheung", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/joe-biden-nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china/index.html", "title": "Biden administration working behind the scenes to convince Pelosi ...", "text": "(CNN) National security officials are quietly working to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the risks her potential trip to Taiwan could pose during a highly sensitive moment between the self-governing island and China .\n\nSources familiar with the speaker's plans say she is planning to visit in the coming weeks as part of a broader trip to Asia and has invited both Democrats and Republicans to accompany her. If she goes, she would be the first House speaker to visit in a quarter century.\n\nThe possible trip is highlighting the concerns within President Joe Biden's administration over China's designs on Taiwan as Beijing has stepped up its rhetoric and aggressive actions toward the island in recent months, including sending warplanes into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone several times. US officials have expressed concern that those moves could be precursors to even more aggressive steps by China in the coming months meant to assert its authority over the island.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only intensified those worries, as Biden and other top officials nervously watch to see what lessons China may be taking from the Western response to Russia's aggression.\n\nMeanwhile, China's President Xi Jinping -- with whom Biden expects to speak this week -- is believed to be laying the groundwork for an unprecedented third term as president in the fall, contributing to the tense geopolitics in the region. Biden's call with Xi was in the works before Pelosi's potential visit to Taiwan became public, officials noted.\n\nAdministration officials have shared their concerns not only about Pelosi's security during the trip, but also worries about how China may respond to such a high-profile visit. With China recently reporting its worst economic performance in two years, Xi finds himself in a politically sensitive place ahead of an important meeting regarding extending his reign and could use a political win, multiple officials told CNN.\n\nWhile Biden's aides have ideas about how he could potentially respond, they aren't sure which direction the Chinese leader will choose.\n\nIt is against that highly charged backdrop that Pelosi has proposed visiting Taiwan with a congressional delegation, a trip that she has so far declined to confirm publicly. But that has not stopped China from lashing out, saying a visit would violate US policy toward the island.\n\n\"China demands the US take concrete actions to fulfill its commitment not to support 'Taiwan independence' and not to arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan,\" Ministry of Defense Spokesperson Tan Kefei said Tuesday in response to questions over Pelosi's reported trip to Taipei.\n\n\"If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by, and it will definitely take strong actions to thwart any external force's interference and separatist's schemes for 'Taiwan independence,' and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Tan added.\n\nBecause Pelosi is in the presidential line of succession, the administration takes extra care for her security when she travels overseas, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nThat includes establishing a footprint on the ground based on the location and environment, sometimes using military resources, according to John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council.\n\n\"We take those obligations seriously,\" Kirby said, even as he reiterated Pelosi has not announced any travel plans to visit Taiwan.\n\nAdministration lays out the risks for Pelosi\n\nBehind the scenes, Biden administration officials have been working to spell out the potential risks of a visit in meetings with Pelosi and her team.\n\nPentagon officials briefed the speaker last week about Taiwan and the heightened tensions in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were also present for the briefing.\n\nThe President let slip last week that the US military was opposed to Pelosi visiting Taiwan now, but the White House has refused to expand on his comments. Even Pelosi said during a news conference last week that she wasn't sure precisely what Biden meant.\n\n\"I think what the President was saying is that maybe the military was afraid of my plane of getting shot down or something like that. I don't know exactly,\" she said.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it was providing Pelosi information about her potential travel.\n\n\"I'll let the speaker talk about her travel plans. Our job is, of course, to make sure she has all the context and information before she travels anywhere. But that kind of rhetoric coming out of the Chinese side is clearly unhelpful and not necessary,\" Kirby said on CNN's \"New Day.\"\n\n\"There's no call for that kind of escalatory rhetoric,\" Kirby added. \"Again, none of this has to devolve into conflict. Nothing's changed about our policies with respect to One China or supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself. So, there's no reason for this to be escalated, even just in rhetoric.\"\n\nPotential trip comes at tense moment in China\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi's trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership don't completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi's potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi's visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn't separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nInstead, the politics surrounding the potential trip have become somewhat reversed. A number of Republicans have encouraged Pelosi to go ahead with her plans, arguing it would be a strong stand against China, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\"Nancy, I'll go with you. I'm banned in China, but not freedom-loving Taiwan. See you there!\" Pompeo tweeted this week.\n\nPelosi has long cultivated a tough-on-China stance. She issued a strong statement in June on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre reminding everyone she helped unfurl a banner there two years after the massacre reading, \"To those who died for democracy in China.\"\n\nBiden looks for stability\n\nBiden, who has sought to stabilize ties with China through regular conversations with his counterpart, is planning a phone conversation with Xi this week in which the issue of Taiwan could likely arise.\n\nHe last spoke to Xi in March, when he worked to convince the Chinese leader not to support Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. Officials have been watching closely how Beijing responds to the invasion, hoping the mostly united Western response — including a withering set of economic sanctions and billions of dollars in arms shipments — proves illuminating as China considers its actions toward Taiwan.\n\nKirby indicated Tuesday that China is observing the global response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as it plots next steps in Taiwan, saying, \"I'm sure they're watching this in real time\" but that there was \"no reason for this to devolve into any kind of conflict.\"\n\nUS officials believe there's a small risk China would miscalculate in responding to a Pelosi visit. Biden administration officials are concerned that China could seek to declare a no-fly zone over Taiwan ahead of a possible visit as an effort to upend the trip, potentially raising tensions even further in the region, a US official told CNN.\n\nThat remains a remote possibility, officials said. More likely, they say, is the possibility China steps up flights further into Taiwan's self-declared air defense zone, which could trigger renewed discussions about possible responses from Taiwan and the US, the US official added. They did not detail what those possible responses would entail.\n\nWhile the administration has not, and does not, plan to officially tell the speaker not to travel to Taiwan, officials have been frank in the briefings about the risks associated with a trip. People familiar with the matter say their hope is to quietly convince Pelosi of the trip's risks without explicitly telling her not to go.\n\nIn the end, the speaker will make her own decision, Biden officials noted.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/politics/nancy-pelosi-asia-trip-taiwan/index.html", "title": "Nancy Pelosi departing for Asia on Friday, but Taiwan stop still ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to depart Friday for a tour of Asia , though whether she stops in Taiwan remains uncertain, a person familiar with the plans said.\n\nPelosi's trip includes stops in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore -- all US allies in the region.\n\nBut a drop-in to self-governing Taiwan was still only tentative as China issues warnings about the House speaker making a possible visit and US-China relations are at a low point.\n\nPelosi is bringing a delegation of fellow lawmakers on the visit.

Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress' US-China working group, told CNN. \"I just don't think it's their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.\"\n\nLarsen said he met with China's San Francisco Consul General in Seattle on Monday, and he also told Larsen to discourage Pelosi from traveling to Taiwan. The consulate did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"It's not my job to tell the speaker what the speaker does or doesn't do,\" said Larsen. \"She has far more experience in these things than I do. And so, I will trust her judgment.\"\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in \"regular contact\" with members of Congress, including Larsen.\n\n\"On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,\" Liu said. \"The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.\"\n\n\"We hope serious consequences could be avoided,\" he added. \"This is in the common interests of both China and the US.\"\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi's right to travel to Taiwan.\n\n\"It is Speaker Pelosi's decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,\" said Illinois Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen's Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. \"In our democratic system -- we operate with separate but equal branches of government.\n\n\"It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the Speaker, Members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,\" LaHood added.\n\nOther members appeared to be more cautious about the potential, diplomatically sensitive trip.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has \"always supported Taiwan.\"\n\nBut when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, \"You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that's when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.\"\n\nWhen asked what she thought, Chu said, \"I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional background information.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak", "Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/27/taiwan-pelosi-gop-lawmakers-china-warning/10164389002/", "title": "Pelosi invites GOP lawmakers to Taiwan, China warns of ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be moving forward with a controversial trip to Taiwan despite fierce pushback from China and some unease inside the Biden administration.\n\nThe possible trip comes amid rising U.S.-China tensions, and some fear a visit by Pelosi could further inflame the relationship.\n\nPelosi's office has not confirmed her travel plans, citing security concerns.

And certain areas of cooperation, including climate change, were hashed out.\n\nBut the Taiwan issue proved among the most contentious. The issue has emerged as a serious point of conflict, as US officials fear a more imminent Chinese move on the self-governing island and as a potential visit by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi prompts warnings from Beijing and a concerted effort by the Biden administration to prevent tensions from spiraling out of control.\n\nThe matter was discussed at length in the two-hour-and-17-minute phone call Thursday. Xi offered an ominous warning to Biden, according to China's version of events.\n\n\"Public opinion shall not be violated, and if you play with fire you get burned.

Ahead of time, US officials said a range of topics -- from the tensions surrounding Taiwan to economic competition to the war in Ukraine -- were likely to arise.\n\nBut hopes for substantially improving ties with Beijing were low. Instead, Biden's aides hope maintaining a personal connection with Xi can, at most, avoid a miscalculation that might lead to confrontation.\n\n\"This is the kind of relationship-tending that President Biden believes strongly in doing, even with nations with which you might have significant differences,\" communications coordinator for the National Security Council John Kirby said this week.\n\nAs Thursday's call was concluding, the two leaders made note of how much work they had created for their teams, including arranging the possible in-person meeting. They have yet to meet face-to-face as presidential counterparts.\n\nOpportunity for a summit could arise in November, when a series of summits will occur in Asia -- including the Group of 20 in Bali, Indonesia, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Bangkok, Thailand . People familiar with the matter said US officials are looking to arrange such a meeting on the margins of one of the summits.\n\nPlanning for Biden's phone call with Xi predated the furor over Pelosi's proposed visit to Taipei. Neither side revealed whether Pelosi's plans were discussed specifically.\n\nBiden is also currently weighing whether to lift some Trump-era tariffs on China in a bid to ease inflation, though White House officials said he hadn't yet made up his mind and suggested ahead of time the topic wouldn't factor heavily into his conversation with Xi.\n\nInstead, it is China's escalating aggression in the region -- including over Taiwan and the South China Sea -- at the center of the current tensions. US officials fear without open lines of communication, misunderstandings could spiral into unintended conflict.\n\nThat includes how Beijing responds to Pelosi's potential visit to Taiwan.\n\nAdministration officials have been working quietly over the past week to convince the House speaker of the risks inherent in visiting the self-governing island. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday he'd spoken to Pelosi to provide his \"assessment of the security situation.\"\n\nPelosi has not made any announcements about her plans for a trip, which haven't been finalized.\n\n\"I never talk about my travel. It's a danger to me,\" she said Wednesday.\n\nYet even unofficial word that the third-in-line to the US presidency was considering a visit to Taiwan prompted an outsized response from Beijing, which considers visits by top-ranking American officials a sign of diplomatic relations with the island.\n\n\"If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by, and it will definitely take strong actions to thwart any external force's interference and separatist's schemes for 'Taiwan independence,' and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Ministry of Defense Spokesperson Tan Kefei said Tuesday in response to questions over Pelosi's reported trip to Taipei.\n\nThe White House called those comments \"unnecessary\" and \"unhelpful,\" saying the rhetoric only served to escalate tensions \"in a completely unnecessary manner.\"\n\nThey also revealed what US officials have said is a misunderstanding by Chinese officials over the significance of Pelosi's potential visit. The officials said China may be confusing Pelosi's visit with an official administration visit since both she and Biden are Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn't separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nThat adds pressure to Biden's call with Xi. Officials were circumspect about whether Pelosi's visit would arise, or how much it would factor into the conversation. But China's apparent confusion over the differences between the White House and Congress could inject a level of personal animus into the talks.\n\nAdministration officials' concerns over Pelosi's trip are rooted partly in its timing. It would come at a particularly tense moment, with the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress during which Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks.\n\nWith China recently reporting its worst economic performance in two years, Xi finds himself in a politically sensitive situation ahead of the important meeting.\n\nBiden and Xi spent many hours in each other's company when each was his country's vice president, traveling across China and the United States to form a bond.\n\nBiden last spoke to Xi in March, when he worked to convince the Chinese leader not to support Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. Officials have been watching closely how Beijing responds to the invasion, hoping the mostly united western response -- including a withering set of economic sanctions and billions of dollars in arms shipments -- proves illuminating as China considers its actions toward Taiwan.\n\nUS officials believe there's a small risk China would miscalculate in responding to a potential Pelosi visit. Biden administration officials are concerned that China could seek to declare a no-fly zone over Taiwan ahead of a possible visit as an effort to upend the trip, potentially raising tensions even further in the region, a US official told CNN.\n\nThat remains a remote possibility, officials said. More likely, they say, is the possibility China steps up flights further into Taiwan's self-declared air defense zone, which could trigger renewed discussions about possible responses from Taiwan and the US, the US official added. They did not detail what those possible responses would entail.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/politics/pelosi-taiwan-china-concerns/index.html", "title": "Nancy Pelosi's possible visit to Taiwan raises concerns China might ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) Biden administration officials are concerned that China could seek to declare a no-fly zone over Taiwan ahead of a possible visit by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as an effort to upend the trip, potentially raising tensions even further in the region, a US official told CNN.\n\nChina could also respond by flying fighter jets further into Taiwan's self-declared air defense zone, which could trigger a response from Taiwan and the US, the official added. They did not detail what a possible response would entail.\n\nChina has sent warplanes into Taiwan's self-declared air defense zone identification zone many times in recent months, an act which does not violate any international law but which usually results in Taiwan taking precautionary defensive measures, including sometimes scrambling its fighter jets.\n\nChinese planes have not entered the island's territorial airspace -- the area extending 12 nautical miles from its coastline.\n\nThe State Department has called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan.\n\nPelosi has been planning a trip to Taiwan in the coming weeks, according to three sources familiar with the planning process.\n\nWhile other members of Congress and former US officials have visited Taiwan this year, Pelosi would be the highest-ranking US lawmaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years. Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich traveled there in 1997.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing over the issue of Taiwan have heightened in recent months. The Chinese Communist Party has long claimed democratically ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to \"reunify\" with the island of 24 million people -- by force if necessary -- despite having never governed it. The US has committed to providing Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though recent weapons sales to Taiwan have been slow to arrive, which has raised concerns among US lawmakers.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington referred CNN to the remarks from the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating firm opposition to a possible Pelosi visit when asked to comment on the airspace concerns.\n\nThe Financial Times was first to report Pelosi's plans for a visit.\n\nPresident Joe Biden cited concerns from the US military about Pelosi's possible trip earlier this week.\n\n\"I think that the military thinks it's not a good idea right now, but I don't know what the status is,\" Biden said on Wednesday when asked whether it was a good idea for Pelosi to travel to the self-governing island.\n\nCol. Dave Butler, Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman, said the military \"in general\" briefs decisionmakers on military assessments. \"We talk about what adversaries may do, discuss logistics and military plans and readiness,\" Butler said. He declined to say whether or not Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley spoke with Pelosi about a proposed trip to Taiwan.\n\nPelosi said it's important to show support for Taiwan on Thursday, but said that she would not be discussing any travel plans, calling to a security issue. Pelosi said she heard \"anecdotally\" about Biden's comments on her possible visit, but said she had not heard anything from the President directly.\n\n\"I think what the President was saying is that maybe the military was afraid of my plane of getting shot down or something like that. I don't know exactly,\" Pelosi said.\n\nState Department officials also have some concerns, two sources said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price deflected questions about the trip on Thursday, calling it a \"hypothetical\" at this time.\n\n\"I am not going to be offering any advice from the is podium,\" Price said when asked about the State Department position on her possible visit.\n\nPrice reiterated that the Biden administration is still adhering to its one China policy, noting that the US does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan but has a \"robust unofficial\" relationship with the island.\n\nVoicing opposition to the possible Pelosi visit, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, said Tuesday that it \"would seriously violate the one China principle and the stipulations in the three China-US joint communiqués and harm China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n\nThe spokesperson for Taiwan's official office in DC, Sabina Chang, told CNN that Taiwan has \"not received any information about a planned visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Chinese planes have entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone but have not violated international law.", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/pelosi-taiwan-visit-pentagon-security-plan/index.html", "title": "Pentagon working to develop security plan for Pelosi ahead of ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) The Pentagon is developing a security plan to use ships and aircraft to keep House Speaker Nancy Pelosi safe should she decide to lead a congressional delegation to Taiwan, according to several Defense officials.\n\nThe plan, which is being developed by John Aquilino, the head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees US military operations across the region, would likely require approval by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. It would also likely be briefed, at least in broad strokes, to President Joe Biden, several US officials say.\n\n\"As you would expect, any time a senior official travels to the region, we are planning how to make sure that official is safe and secure,\" a senior Defense official told CNN.\n\nSources familiar with Pelosi's plans say she is planning to visit Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own territory, in the coming weeks as part of a broader trip to Asia. Though the California Democrat has so far declined to confirm the trip publicly, she has invited both Democrats and Republicans to accompany her. If she goes, she would be the first House speaker to visit in a quarter century.\n\nThe trip, however, has raised concerns within the Biden administration , with national security officials quietly working to convince Pelosi of the risks a visit could pose during a highly sensitive moment between Taiwan and China.\n\nThe Pentagon, and in particular the Navy, already keeps a substantial force in the region. Key assets such as the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, with its fighter and reconnaissance aircraft on board, could be moved closer to Taiwan by heading into position in the South China Sea. The Air Force could also be used for additional capability to monitor airspace and conduct reconnaissance. Other assets could be positioned at further distances, ready to move if contingencies arise.\n\n\"There are always layers of force protection,\" a second Defense official said of this type of planning.\n\nIf needed, the Pentagon could also move reconnaissance satellites over the region to get a continuous flow of intelligence on Chinese military movements, officials say.\n\nConcern about possible miscalculations\n\nBut the constant worry among US officials is that miscalculations or inadvertent incidents or accidents could occur if China and the US significantly increase their air and maritime operations in the region.\n\nThough the Pentagon won't publicly acknowledge the military plan, \"you should expect the department to look at what assets are available in the area,\" the second official said.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate to comment on any congressional travel possibilities, \" said Lt. Col. Martin Meiners, a DOD spokesman.\n\nThe US does not expect direct hostile action from Beijing during a potential visit by Pelosi. At least five Defense officials described this as a very remote possibility and said the Pentagon wants to see the public rhetoric lowered. The sense is the US will have a better understanding of China's view after President Joe Biden talks with President Xi Jinping in a call scheduled for Thursday.\n\nOfficials say, however, that they are ready for China to continue to conduct potentially aggressive air or at-sea interactions with the US or allies in the region. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley has assembled a classified summary of Chinese intercepts over the last five years against US and allied aircraft.\n\nBut a key DOD policy official has gone a step further, highlighting the most near term concerns.\n\n\"I want to be clear that these are not isolated incidents; that over the last five years the number of unsafe PLA intercepts, including US allies and partners operating lawfully in international airspace in the South China Sea, has increased dramatically, with dozens of dangerous events in the first half of this year alone,\" Ely Ratner, who serves as the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said in a speech this week.\n\nRisks for Pelosi\n\nAustin acknowledged to reporters Wednesday that he has spoken to Pelosi, adding that he remains \"concerned ... about the aggressiveness of the PRC and the kinds of things that we've been seeing in the region lately.\"\n\n\"And so I think we have to be vigilant, you know, throughout, even as we're operating in that region. But in terms of what specific security requirements that we would be called upon to provide in support of Speaker Pelosi, I won't comment on that,\" he said.\n\nPentagon officials briefed the speaker last week about Taiwan and the heightened tensions in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were also present for the briefing.\n\nBecause Pelosi is in the presidential line of succession, the administration takes extra care for her security when she travels overseas, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nThe President let slip last week that the US military was opposed to Pelosi visiting Taiwan now, but the White House has refused to expand on his comments. Pelosi said during a news conference last week that she wasn't sure precisely what Biden meant.\n\n\"I think what the President was saying is that maybe the military was afraid of my plane of getting shot down or something like that.

But when they hatch, the pests can turn a lush green lawn into a brown, barren wasteland seemingly overnight.\n\n\"This year is like a perfect storm,\" said Rick Brandenburg, an entomologist at North Carolina State University. \"In my 40 years, I have never seen the problem as widespread as it is this year.\"\n\nBrandenburg said armyworms — more specifically fall armyworms — are laying siege to North Carolina but also as far west as Texas and as far north as Michigan and northeastern states, areas that rarely see such significant armyworm populations.\n\nEric Rebek, an Oklahoma State University entomology professor, said his phone has been ringing \"off the hook\" with requests for information about the infestation of grass pastures, lawns and fields of peanuts, alfalfa, cotton, double cropped soybean and sorghum.\n\nHe said the buggy brigade returns to Oklahoma each year in late summer and early fall, marching in large swaths from one food source to another until the winter frost kills them. But this year, he said there's been an \"unprecedented\" number of armyworms, not just in Oklahoma but also in Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.\n\n\"They can easily munch their way through whatever, whether it's a lawn or a park or a golf course,\" Rebek said. \"They just lay waste to everything in their path, moving through just like an army on the move.\"\n\nIn northeast Oklahoma, Kevin Walker, noticed the small caterpillars inundating his yard last month. While he was at Home Depot buying pesticide, he said every single person in line in front of him was also trying to expel the creatures from their own yards.\n\nWalker said he was able to save most of the yard of his one-acre home, but some of his neighbors weren't as lucky.\n\n“He said it was like overnight,\" Walker said of his neighbor. \"...They had gone through it in that whole night ... That's why they call them armyworms.\"\n\nLawn care businesses in Wellington Kansas have also been working round the clock to contain the infestations with some retailers quickly selling out of pesticides.\n\nIn Kentucky, Bethany Pratt, the Jefferson County horticulture education agent for the University of Kentucky's Cooperative Extension Service, said she gets dozens of calls every couple days about the pests.\n\nMore bugs:Meet the spotted lanternfly, the bug health officials are begging you to kill on sight\n\nEven more bugs:Summer rains in this national park draw out acid-spraying, scorpion-like creatures\n\nWhat exactly is a fall armyworm?\n\nRebek said there are two kinds of armyworms: the true armyworm and the fall armyworm, the latter of which is the scourge homeowners are now facing. The fall armyworms, which are indigenous to the U.S., are the larval stage of the fall armyworm moth.\n\nThe caterpillars grow up to two inches long and can be green, brown or black in color. They can be identified by an inverted white \"y\" on their head capsules, Rebek said.\n\nThe fall armyworm also has two strains: the corn and rice strain, he said. The corn strain feeds on corn, sorghum and cotton while the rice strains eats rice, alfalfa and millet, as well as the pasture grasses and lawns.\n\nWhat kind of damage can they do?\n\nFall armyworms feast on grass of all kinds, but the extent of the damage depends on the type of grass, Rebek said. Warm season grasses grown in southern states can regenerate after armyworm invasions, but the caterpillars can permanently devastate cool season grasses.\n\n\"For warm season grass, is mostly an aesthetic issue,\" he said. \"But if you have cool season grass, you probably want to treat your lawn.\"\n\nWhy are we seeing such a widespread, intense outbreak?\n\nExperts say it could be a number of factors, including a warming climate, wetter weather or changes in natural enemies such as predators, parasites and pathogens.\n\n\"It's likely a very complex interaction that is occurring this year that leads to this outbreak,\" Rebek said, adding that it's common for populations to ebb and flow. \"It's hard to point your finger at any one thing.\"\n\nBrandenburg said while climate change has the potential to increase the likelihood of tropical pests like fall armyworms infesting lawns, it's difficult to make a direct link between the two because so many factors are at play.\n\nHow did the armyworms get here?\n\nUnable to survive in freezing temperatures, the fall armyworm spends the winter in the Gulf Coast states before heading north on southerly winds, Brandenburg said.\n\nHe said the creatures begin to appear in spring in southeastern states before showing up in the Mid-Atlantic by mid-summer and the upper Midwest and northeast by late summer. They can be almost annual pests in southeastern parts of the country and sporadic pests of once every decade or so in eastern states.\n\nBrandenburg added fall armyworms have recently invaded some areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, where it infested corn, maize, sorghum and millet crops in 2016 before spreading through Yemen and South Asia to Thailand and China.\n\nRebek said this movement was likely done with the help of people, who may have transported armyworms to other countries through trade.\n\nHow do you prevent armyworm attacks and revive your lawn post-siege?\n\nUnfortunately, there's not much people can do to protect their lawns from the scourge.\n\n\"It's hard to deter them,\" Rebek said. \"And it's hard to predict where they'll land and prevent that from happening.\"\n\nRebek warned homeowners to be watchful, saying \"It really just comes down to monitoring and being vigilant and watching for signs of trouble.\"\n\nPratt, from the University of Kentucky's Cooperative Extension Service, said once you notice a patch of brown grass, you're probably too late. Since the armyworms have likely already burrowed beneath the surface to begin pupating, she suggested waiting to re-seed your grass until the second wave begins. She said to watch for the next round of egg masses to appear and then treat your yard with insecticides for small caterpillars.\n\n\"You're going to plan on managing them and not controlling,\" Pratt said. \"Nothing will ever do 100% control unless you're also getting rid of your lawn.\"\n\nShe added dumping a jug of soapy water onto the eaten grass can push buried armyworms to the surface where they can be seen.\n\nBrandenburg said one of the first signs to watch for is birds feeding on the caterpillars. If you see a large number of birds in your yard, they may have found a significant food source like a battalion of armyworms.\n\nRebek advised that people to check the label on their insecticide because many are broad spectrum and kill more than just fall armyworms. These insecticides can kill predatory insects that help control other pest insects, pollinators like bees, and Monarch butterflies.\n\nHe added people should find solace in the fact that the cold will end the scourge of the armyworm.\n\n“When we get our first killing frost, there will be no further action that will be necessary because that cold weather will ultimately kill them off, and then, you know, we'll wait and see what happens next year,” Rebek said.\n\nContributing: JaNae Williams, The Oklahoman; Sylvia Goodman, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nContact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/29/us/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-sunday/index.html", "title": "Uvalde elementary school: Agony is compounded by outrage after ...", "text": "(CNN) The bright sunshine in Uvalde belies the cloud of anger and anguish enveloping the small Texas city.\n\nLocal funeral homes are so overwhelmed, it will take weeks to bury some of the 19 children and two teachers killed Tuesday at Robb Elementary School\n\nAnd days after the massacre, victims' families learned more about what really happened in classrooms 111 and 112 during their loved ones' final moments.\n\nChildren who were trapped near the gunman called 911 several times, begging for help.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n\"Deal.\"\n\nDivision of labor is essential amidst the world's toughest lockdown. We are modern hunter-gatherers from a privileged position in a high-rise building in the Pudong district of Shanghai.\n\nIn the beginning, we would spend half our days procuring food and beverages. Now, it is more like two hours a day. We eat what we can get our hands on, but we are in no danger of running short of essential items such as water, soap, and basic staples.\n\nWe wonder if this is similar to our experience growing up under hyperinflation in Brazil in the early 1990s or if it is just our minds playing tricks on us. But back to reality. There are mangoes to last us a few months -- 25 pounds of the fruit, to be precise.\n\nChina is in the grip of its first significant outbreak of Covid-19 in two years, prompting a government-mandated lockdown of multiple cities as part of its uncompromising zero-Covid strategy. The primary hotspot is Shanghai , China's financial hub of 25 million residents, our current adopted home for the last six years, and where we still plan to live for the next 40.\n\nShanghai residents Rodrigo Zeidan and Melissa Nogueira are finding out that sometimes the minimum order of food items, is more than enough. Like this order of a box of mangoes.\n\nA year ago, daily life reached a balance. Life was back to normal with two exceptions: we should wear masks when using public transportation and in certain government buildings, and any news of a single Covid-19 case in the city spread like wildfire.\n\nEverybody was aware that if somebody in their community were to test positive for Covid-19, a targeted lockdown would ensue. It would last 14 days in the places where the case was found and two days in places where the person had passed by (as long as everybody tested negative for two consecutive days).\n\nStill, with monthly cases in the single digits, we never met anybody who was locked down. That changed early this year when cases started to mount and places were more often forcefully closed.\n\nIn mid-February, when cases started climbing in Shanghai, people would ask themselves before going anywhere: \"Does the venue have toilets?\" (People who got locked down in a department store were handed buckets, as there were no facilities on the premises)? Does it have an open space? Were there any confirmed cases nearby?\" People would try to avoid lockdown risk at any cost and, at the same time, be prepared for the worst.\n\nThat meant carrying a bag with toiletries, a change of clothes and essential items to the office in case of a spontaneous lockdown.\n\nOn March 10, amid rising cases, our eleventh-grader son's school informed us they were switching to virtual learning. New York University Shanghai, where Rodrigo teaches, did the same shortly after.\n\nWe could still go out, and everything was open. But we decided to avoid crowds and even public transportation -- no more basketball, tennis, or happy hours. The city was still a living organism, and our three-bedroom apartment has plenty of space. Many people, especially migrant workers, have no such luck.\n\nA government food package sent to Shanghai residents Rodrigo Zeidan and Melissa Nogueira, including noodles, sausages, spinach, mushrooms, SPAM.\n\nAfter a day or two of this, we chose to self-isolate. We didn't want to risk being sent to centralized quarantine or getting stuck in an impromptu lockdown in a department store or a restaurant. We sensed a complete shutdown coming.\n\nWe have been there before, watching cases rise while authorities postpone the inevitable, in both Spain and Brazil, in 2020. What we didn't know was that the Shanghainese version would include shutting down deliveries and closing supermarkets and grocery stores.\n\nOn March 24, we woke to the building WeChat group buzzing with the news that our compound had a resident who had tested positive for Covid-19. The entire 18-building compound would be closed off to the outside world for at least 15 days.\n\nThe particular building where the person lived would be sealed, and residents there wouldn't be able to leave unless it was a medical emergency.\n\nAs the residents of other buildings were still allowed to use the compound's shared areas, some of our neighbors set up tents and a picnic table on the central lawn where people gathered, trading snacks and laughter, with kids playing all around. Nobody could go outside, but life was not that bad in our community.\n\nThe worst was yet to come. On March 27, Shanghai instituted a staggered lockdown. Pudong, east of the river, where we lived, was closed down first. Then Puxi, in the west, five days later. In Puxi, families swept through grocery stores and supermarkets, leaving almost nothing in their wake.\n\nWe had no such chance to bulk buy. Neither did our neighbors. The stringency of the lockdown caught us unprepared, with no time to stock up. We switched to survival mode.\n\nIt helps that we were both children of Latin America's hyperinflation. Overnight, our minds raced to the lessons learned from Brazil in the early-1990s. At that time, spending one's monthly salary as quickly as possible was the norm. As prices could rise by 10% or more each month, every month there was no point in holding on to cash. Got some money in your pocket? Spend it all before it loses all its value.\n\nThus, stocking up on food was a recurrent family adventure, in which the goal was to spend every single dime while ensuring that the food would last until the next paycheck arrived. Families shared lessons about preserving food in bulk and using the same ingredient differently.\n\nThen, as now, there was no point in wallowing about our predicament. Our mantra was \"do what you must and control what you can.\"\n\nThe first hurdle of the Shanghai's severe lockdown was surprisingly easy to overcome. A neighbor helped us communicate with the community manager, who coordinates with official authorities about the evolving rules and regulations that each community must follow.\n\nWe got a special dispensation to go to the nearby clinic to pick up continued-use medicines. We have a bike, which is useful when people are afraid of community spread in closed environments like cars or buses, and we are considered responsible neighbors.\n\nHowever, food and beverages turned out to be a much more significant obstacle. A few small restaurants delivered, but usually just one or two dishes. One of us would spend countless hours ordering anything that became available and looked edible. There was no news about food packages from the government; we have received two, more than a week apart, and while welcome, they would not cover all our needs.\n\nWe turned to the compound's group chat for support. The community came together to coordinate bulk purchases directly from producers. For each category, there was a group chat: fruits, vegetables, rice, eggs, milk, and so on. Without Google translate and a helpful neighbor who speaks perfect English, it would have been much harder to navigate it.\n\nSometimes, purchases would come through. Other times, not. Minimum order thresholds varied widely. We placed an order for mangoes and strawberries. They arrived. Beautiful and tasty fruit, but what do you do with 25 pounds of mangoes, 6 pounds of strawberries, and 10 pounds of rice for three people?\n\nOut of all the anxiety and frustration, there has been one silver lining. The community banded together. We lent kitchen knives and donated salt; a neighbor dropped ten apples from her purchase of 35 pounds of Golden Delicious. We all contributed to a few households that were running short of basic staples.\n\nFinally, some reliability. We connected, at first through a Chinese app and then directly, to one of the few delivery persons allowed to move around Pudong. We tip him well to purchase what is available around here. The selection is stark, but we don't care. We have lived through much worse in Brazil.\n\nOne day we woke up to a loud banging on our door. We got scared, as it could mean one of us would be carried away to a quarantine facility. Opening the door, people in hazmat suits. Our hearts skipped a beat. Luckily, they were there to deliver rapid antigen tests.\n\nAlthough things are slowly getting better, there is no end in sight to the lockdown. A community is clear when it goes 15 days without anybody testing positive. As the cases still have not peaked, we foresee a few weeks before we can move about freely.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.

We are safe, with enough to eat, and have a fully stocked library. We have plenty of space in a high-end compound where we have all we need but not all we want.\n\nThere are many ways to relive one's childhood. Who would have picked this one?

But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Globalization is coming undone, and that's a huge ...", "text": "London (CNN Business) One of the many buzzwords percolating around Davos this week is \"fragmentation,\" the force economists there warned could have \"devastating human consequences.\"\n\nBy \"fragmentation,\" they are referring to a breakdown of the kind of free-wheeling, border-crossing trade and investment that's defined the global economic order over the past three decades. It is a form of deglobalization — rebuilding fences around national or regional fiefdoms.\n\n\"Fragmentation is the sense that we may be having economies protect themselves a little more domestically, and that could slow things down,\" Josh Lipsky, director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, told me. \"And then it may make things more expensive in return.\"\n\nIt's not a new issue, of course — supply-chain upheaval was turbocharged by the start of the pandemic more than two years ago — but the war in Ukraine, growing political divides and lingering trade disputes are renewing concerns about a return to an era of isolation.\n\n\"The choices of both business and government are expected to lead to greater fragmentation in the global economy and unprecedented shifts in supply chains, creating a perfect storm of volatility and uncertainty,\" wrote a group of chief economists surveyed by the World Economic Forum. \"These patterns are expected to create further difficult trade-offs and choices for policymakers, and — without greater coordination — shocking human costs.\"\n\nBefore the Davos crowd had a chance to hit their first happy hour of the week, the world got a glimpse of micro-fragmentations playing out in real time.\n\nChina's ride-hailing giant Didi, scaling back its once-grand global ambitions, officially delisted its shares from the NYSE.\n\nStarbucks pulled out of Russia, after McDonald's last week, continuing the mass corporate exodus over the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia's foreign minister said the West had taken a \"dictator's position,\" and that Moscow must strengthen ties with China.\n\nAirbnb said it would pull all of its listings in China, citing \"costly and complex\" operation constraints tied to the Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nMalaysia moved to restrict exports of chicken to its neighbors, saying \"the government's priority is our own people.\"\n\nEconomists are understandably worried about a retreat to polarized East-West models of trade and production. The US baby formula shortage is a public health crisis that illustrates the peril of relying too heavily on domestic production for essential goods. And while globalization has its downsides, it has tripled the size of the global economy and lifted 1.3 billion people out of extreme poverty, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nHuawei, the Chinese telecom giant, is another salient example of how political polarities have contributed to fragmentation, says Xiaomeng Lu, a geo-technologies director at Eurasia Group. \"There's definitely a trust issue for companies from both China and the US ... You can also see Microsoft slowly scaling back their China practice as well.\"\n\nStep back: Fragmentation isn't only about trade. It's also about finance and the supremacy of the US dollar.\n\n\"Given the punitive measures the West has taken against Russia, there's a serious conversation in some economies, including China, about reducing reliance on the dollar,\" Lipsky told me.\n\nThe West has become accustomed to the dollar's dominance, and investors should be mindful that a shift is underway. The dollar still makes the world go around, on networks like SWIFT that are Western-controlled, but digital currencies could eventually offer an alternative.\n\nTo be clear: It won't happen overnight.\n\n\"These supply chains have been built over 30 years, so you just can't move them into another country,\" Lipsky says. \"Check back in at Davos in 10 years and see how different the global economic system is. It doesn't mean there's not a desire to change, but actually doing it is far more complicated.\"\n\nA gloomy reunion\n\nHere's Julia Horowitz, the lead writer of Before the Bell, with a dispatch from Davos, Switzerland, where she's reporting on the World Economic Forum.\n\nOld friends and acquaintances are catching up in the halls and on the street. There's handshakes, backslapping, asking after kids and spouses. Many haven't traveled for work in years, lending the event the air of a happy reunion.\n\nBut Russia's invasion of Ukraine is undeniably dragging down the mood.\n\n\"Davos is all about crafting a better future. That is what we should be talking about here today. Instead, we have to talk about the cost and consequences of Putin's war of choice,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a keynote speech to participants.\n\nShe slammed Russia's weaponization of its energy supply and warned of a looming food crisis as Russian troops bar crucial grain shipments from leaving the country, claiming Moscow is \"using hunger and grain to wield power.\"\n\n\"Global wheat prices are skyrocketing, and it is fragile countries and vulnerable populations that suffer most,\" von der Leyen said.\n\nBusiness leaders, meanwhile, are speaking about the state of the world with less bravado, acknowledging that at present, there's a lot they can't control.\n\nAlan Jope, the CEO of Unilever, told me after a panel on sustainability that while he's \"confident in the underlying performance\" of the consumer goods giant, inflation is making his life \"harder.\"\n\nHe said he's \"concerned about the burden inflation is going to put on people around the world — especially those people on the socioeconomic spectrum who are least able to afford the inflationary pressures that are coming through.\"\n\nUnilever, which makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, hiked prices last quarter by 8%, and said it would need to keep raising prices \"thoughtfully\" to account for the rising cost of agricultural products and fuel.\n\nOn the radar: Unilever investor Terry Smith made waves earlier this year when he criticized the company's public focus on its \"sustainability credentials,\" which he said came \"at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business.\"\n\n\"A company which feels it has to define the purpose of Hellmann's mayonnaise has in our view clearly lost the plot,\" Smith said.\n\nJope told me that investors like Smith are \"entitled to their own opinions,\" but the \"overwhelming majority sentiment\" is that Unilever should stay the course. \"I understand Terry's frustration at that moment in time, but I don't think it's the majority view of our investor base,\" Jope said.\n\nSnap goes the rally?\n\nSnapchat's parent company is dragging tech stocks down Tuesday after Monday's modest rally. What's going on?\n\nLate Monday, Snap Inc. issued a surprise warning in a regulatory filing, saying the \"macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated\" in the past month. The social media company slashed its quarterly forecast, triggering an after-hours sell-off.\n\nSnap shares were down some 30% in premarket trading, dragging the whole sector down with it. Facebook parent Meta dropped 7%, while Pinterest fell 11%. Alphabet dropped 3.6% and Amazon fell 2.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, unsurprisingly, was down nearly 2% after finishing Monday up 1.6%\n\nIn a memo to staff, Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company would slow hiring for this year and laid out a broad slate of problems.\n\n\"Like many companies, we continue to face rising inflation and interest rates, supply chain shortages and labor disruptions, platform policy changes, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and more,\" he wrote.\n\nThe big concern now seems to be advertising — something that Snap, Facebook, Twitter, and others rely on heavily, and often the first thing to get axed when budget managers start looking for areas to scale back.\n\n\"Investors are getting set for another twist on the rollercoaster,\" with Monday's gains set to be largely erased by Snap's downbeat assessment, wrote Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nIt seems Monday's tech rally may prove fleeting, not unlike the images that Snap built its name on.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columns/brandy-mcdonnell/2021/01/15/how-covid-19-and-oklahomas-film-industry-growth-impacted-top-10-movies-of-2020/321382007/", "title": "How COVID-19 and Oklahoma's film industry growth impacted top ...", "text": "Brandy McDonnell\n\nMovie theaters shut down, streaming services ramped up, and superheroes and other tentpole protagonists were suddenly sidelined during 2020, a year with more plot twists than a horde of Hollywood screenwriters could have ever imagined.\n\nEven as COVID-19 continually changed — and continues to change — all aspects of American life, heroes new and old emerged in the film industry. Oklahoma's burgeoning movie scene started making an impact on awards season, with the celebrated Tulsa-made drama \"Minari\" generating Oscars buzz (assuming, of course, those coveted golden statuettes actually get handed out on April 25) and Edmond-based filmmaker Andrew Patterson picking up prizes for his feature film debut \"The Vast of Night.\"\n\nAlthough many potential blockbusters were pushed out of their release dates due to the pandemic, plenty of independent and foreign films like the Irish animated tale \"Wolfwalkers\" and the Russian horror film \"Sputnik\" made meaningful bows in the year just past. Even when they were forced to close their physical theaters, art houses like the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, Rodeo Cinema, Tower Theater and Tulsa's Circle Cinema have helped curate such promising titles through their innovative Virtual Cinema offerings.\n\nHere are my top 10 films — plus five honorable mentions, including two Oklahoma-made movies — from the undeniably strange and memorable days of 2020:\n\n1. 'Wolfwalkers'\n\n2020 was an excellent year for animated films, perhaps due in part to the pandemic keeping families with children at home.\n\nFledgling Irish animation house Cartoon Saloon has created four feature films — 2010's \"The Secret of Kells,\" 2015's \"Song of the Sea,\" 2017's \"The Breadwinner\" and \"Wolfwalkers\" — and all of them have proven painterly instant classics. A visually enchanting adventure based on Celtic folklore and history, \"Wolfwalkers\" is set in 1650 in a remote, walled Irish city under oppressive English rule, but its themes about tyranny and otherness, friendship and family, nature and myths remain timeless.\n\nWhen English lass Robyn Goodfellowe (voice of Honor Kneafsey) sneaks out of the city and follows her father (Sean Bean), the town's designated wolf hunter, into the wilderness, she befriends the wild Mebh (Eva Whittaker), one of the legendary \"wolfwalkers,\" magical and enigmatic people who take on canine form while their human bodies sleep.\n\nHow to see it: Apple TV+.\n\n2. 'Sputnik'\n\nA frighteningly effective sci-fi horror story, this Cold War Russian-language thriller definitely owes a debt to Ridley Scott's iconic \"Alien.\" But the assured feature film debut from director Egor Abramenko turns that familiarity to its advantage, whipping through as many surprising twists and turns as its terrifying otherworldly creature.\n\nIn 1983, a Moscow-based neuropsychiatrist (Oksana Akinshina) known for her radical methods is whisked away to a secret base to consult on the case of a cosmonaut (Pyotr Fyodorov) who didn't come back alone from his recent trip into space.\n\nHow to see it: Hulu, Amazon Prime, YouTube and more.\n\n3. 'Minari'\n\nLee Isaac Chung’s semi-autobiographical family drama, which was filmed in Tulsa in 2019, centers on a Korean immigrant family that moves from Los Angeles to the Heartland to start a farm and pursue the American Dream.\n\nAlthough the story is set in Arkansas, the Oklahoma skies, farmland and woods are beautifully showcased in the moving but not maudlin movie, which earned both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the January 2020 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nOver the past year, \"Minari\" has steadily and quietly continued to touch audiences and earn acclaim, especially for Yuh-Jung Youn, who plays the feisty Korean grandmother who moves in with the family to help care for the story's lively 7-year-old protagonist, David (Alan Kim).\n\nThe Oklahoma Film Critics Circle, of which I'm a founding and voting member, not only honored Youn as best supporting actress but also named \"Minari\" its best picture of 2020.\n\nHow to see it: Full theatrical release is planned for February.\n\n4. 'The Vast of Night'\n\nThe Oklahoma Film Critics Circle bestowed its best first feature award on Edmond director Andrew Patterson for his atmospheric sci-fi mystery, which was filmed in Whitney, Texas, with a largely Oklahoma crew. On Monday, Patterson received the Bingham Ray Breakthrough Director Award at New York's 30th Annual Gotham Awards, considered one of the first major ceremonies of the cinematic awards season.\n\nThe throwback thriller is set in 1957 in tiny Cayuga, New Mexico, where smart and curious telephone switchboard operator Fay (Sierra McCormick) and hip yet brainy radio DJ Everett (Jake Horowitz) pinpoint a bizarre audio frequency interfering with both their jobs. The teenagers embark on a life-changing quest to uncover the cause of the strange sounds in the film, which received the Audience Award for best narrative feature at the 2019 Slamdance Film Festival.\n\nHow to see it: Amazon Prime.\n\n5. 'Nomadland'\n\nFrances McDormand has been nominated for five acting Academy Awards, winning for \"Fargo\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\" But that still somehow feels like inadequate acclaim after watching her unadorned, film-carrying tour de force turn in writer-director Chloé Zhao's visually striking and delicately understated road movie.\n\nBased on journalist Jessica Bruder's 2017 nonfiction book, the drama follows Fern (McDormand), a widow who loses her job and house in the Great Recession and leaves her small Nevada home to become a modern-day nomad, living out of her customized van, taking seasonal jobs and traversing the American West.\n\nAlong with McDormand and Oscar-nominated character actor David Strathairn, the timely and resonant drama co-stars real-life nomads Charlene Swankie, Linda May and Bob Wells playing fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nConsidered an Oscar front-runner, \"Nomadland\" already has earned high honors from the Gotham Awards, Venice Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival and the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, of which I'm also a voting member.\n\nHow to see it: Full theatrical release is planned for February.\n\n6. 'Soul'\n\nDespite the pandemic and thanks to Disney+, the animation masterminds at Pixar managed to release not one but two touching tales in 2020, with \"Soul\" and \"Onward.\" But director and co-writer Pete Docter's spiritual sequel to \"Inside Out\" is something special, boasting innovative visuals, creative storytelling and wonderful music that combine into a cinematic experience that is weird, profound and life-affirming.\n\nPixar's 23rd feature also boasts some overdue advances: Kemp Powers (who wrote the celebrated 2020 live-action drama \"One Night in Miami\") becomes Pixar's first African American co-director with \"Soul,\" which also boasts the studio's first Black protagonist in Joe (Oscar winner Jamie Foxx), a middle-school music teacher and aspiring jazz pianist who is literally rushing to seize the chance of a lifetime when an accident puts him in a coma.\n\nDetermined to avoid \"The Great Beyond,\" get back to his body and finally live his long-held dream of performing with a beloved band leader (Angela Bassett), Joe's soul stumbles into \"The Great Before,\" where souls dwell into they find their spark and venture down to Earth.\n\n\"Soul\" has already scooped up several prizes for best animated feature as well as for its Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score, and given Pixar's stellar Oscars track record, there's no reason to expect that to stop this awards season.\n\nHow to see it: Disney+.\n\n7. 'First Cow'\n\nThe latest melancholy, minimalist film from respected indie auteur Kelly Reichardt (\"Meek's Cutoff,\" \"Wendy and Lucy,\"), this frontier drama manages to be a lot things without a lot of fuss. It's a slow-moving but engrossing mystery, a stereotype-shattering Western and a tale of friendship that is stirring but not syrupy.\n\nGorgeously filmed on location, the period piece is set in 1820 in the wilds of Oregon Country and follows Otis \"Cookie\" Figowitz (John Magaro), a quiet and gentle chef who is traveling with a rowdy group of fur trappers when he meets King-Lu (Orion Lee), a cunning Chinese immigrant hiding from Russian heavies.

The specter of Milla's impending death has taken a steep toll on the upper-middle-class family, and their life is further disrupted when she falls in love for the first time — with Moses (Toby Wallace, the Aussie soap opera \"Neighbours\"), a live-wire 23-year-old drug addict and dealer.\n\nHow to see it: Hulu, YouTube and Vudu.\n\n9.

Desperate to preserve her mother's memory and prove the moon goddess Chang'e (Phillipa Soo) they both loved is real, Fei Fei builds a rocket to the Moon and successfully makes an unexpectedly mystical journey with an unexpected stowaway: her ornery 8-year-old future stepbrother, Chin (Robert G. Chiu).\n\nPenned by screenwriter Audrey Wells (“The Hate U Give”), who died of cancer in 2018, with additional material by Alice Wu and Jennifer Yee McDevitt, \"Over the Moon\" is both a breathtakingly beautiful celebration of Chinese culture and a universally relatable tale of coping with loss and change.\n\nHow to see it: Netflix.\n\n10.

These episodes are airing now.\n\nDuring production, there were temperature checks, the crew lived together in isolation, the cast did their own hair and make-up and there were individual prop trolleys. A pole was used to make sure people stayed two meters (six feet) apart.\n\nIt went so well, that they began shooting regular episodes Monday. Now other soaps are contacting them to learn how they were able to get back on the set. TV and movie production around the world shutdown nearly three months ago after the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 400,000 people worldwide.\n\nTV's biggest cliffhanger: Will my show return on schedule?\n\n“We felt very, very determined to get it back,” executive producer Jane Hudson said. “I always reference my nan, she watches all the soaps, and she’s 86 and she’s on her own, and none of us can visit her. There’s lots of nans out there, who want to see the soaps.”\n\n“Emmerdale” has been on screen in the U.K. since 1972 and was in danger — like many serial dramas — of running out of episodes after the production halt.\n\nRival London-based soap “EastEnders” runs out of fresh episodes June 16. Producers will broadcast special programming and iconic shows until the soap can begin production.\n\nAt “Emmerdale,″ Hudson’s willingness to embrace ways to implement government guidelines on social distancing meant a minimal team of cast and crew returned to work on the Leeds set on May 20.\n\n“I consider us to be pioneers going back, we’re the first show back to production in continuing drama,” said actor James Hooton, who has played soap’s Sam Dingle on and off for 25 years.\n\nMore:The best new TV shows of 2020 so far, from 'Upload' to 'Never Have I Ever'\n\n“We’ve gone for the gold standard of health and safety, because obviously there are a lot of people at this time that are extremely concerned about going back to work,″ Hooton said. “And for me, to see what everyone has done to make people feel as protected in that working environment as possible, has been amazing.”\n\nThe most useful addition to the set is the 2-meter (6 foot) pole. Not seen on screen, but constantly used, the pole measures the distance between people.\n\nActors do their own hair and makeup while being monitored by technicians from another part of the studio. Jeff Hordley, who plays brooding Cain Dingle, got off lightly with “covering a couple of spots and putting some hair product in,” he said.\n\nThe environment is controlled with taped out areas, no location scenes or extras and specially cleaned prop trolleys — each set up individually.\n\nFor example, a scene between newlywed characters Sam and Lydia involved the reading of a letter. “We had two copies of that letter as it’s classed as contamination if two individuals that are socially distancing on set touch the same thing,” Hooton explained.\n\n“It’s bestowed a bit more responsibility on us all so we have to make sure we have everything we need for our working day on that (props) trolley,” he adds.\n\nFor Hordley, the weird thing is reuniting with the crew after months away and, as the technical team are all in isolation together, he can’t greet them properly.\n\n“It’s just strange because we are such a huggy bunch being actors, as I’m sure everyone in the world right now could do with a hug. That’s the weird thing is, seeing them and not naturally going towards them,” he said.\n\nThe lockdown episodes are much more like a play than a normal “Emmerdale” episode, which would feature village locations and plenty of socializing scenes in The Woolpack pub. There’s a maximum of three characters on an indoor set, with no extras involved.\n\nAnd the story lines mirror that of the audience — stuck at home over the past three months because of the coronavirus, worrying about family, missing friends, panicking about food supplies or taking stock of your life.\n\nHordley’s Cain Dingle is not a caring sort and being trapped with his heartbroken nephew Aaron leads to amusing moments and poignant scenes.\n\n“I’m sure there will be lots of people in lockdown having revelations about how to live their life because it really makes you quite introspective, having this time to yourself,” Hordley said.\n\nShowrunners from around the world want to speak to Hudson about how production was resumed. She’s talked to “Neighbours” in Australia, “Shortland Street” in New Zealand, and “Coronation Street,” down the highway in Manchester.\n\n“Rating figures are so important. Right now, we can just put them to one side for the moment and let’s get us all back working safely. I think that’s the priority,” Hudson said. “The soaps are one genre and we rise and fall together and I don’t want to see any soap failing during this. I want us to all come back strong.”\n\n“Emmerdale’s” lockdown episodes are showing Monday and Wednesday on ITV in the U.K.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/10"}]}

The legacy of slave owners on the island is apparent, she continued, adding that “white Barbadians account for about 2.5% of the 280,000 population but they own most of the island’s productive land”.\n\nCalls for an apology\n\nAlongside demands for reparations, some campaigners have been calling on the Royal Family to apologise for the role of its ancestors in the slave trade.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "publish_date": "2021/11/30"}]}

Member states still need to approve the sanctions, “which are among dozens of newly proposed, targeted travel bans and asset freezes”.\n\nPutin has never publicly acknowledged his children, but it is generally thought he has at least two daughters, Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, with his ex-wife Lyudmila Ocheretny.\n\nSanctioning the pair “is largely a symbolic move since it’s unclear they have significant assets outside of Russia”, said Bloomberg. “It’s designed to get the president’s attention”. The Wall Street Journal said it was “possible” that the US would also roll out similar sanctions, but this remains unclear.\n\nPutin has always been notoriously secretive about his private life, making a “concerted effort to shield his children from the spotlight, prompting many to question whether he even has children at all”, said Business Insider.\n\nHe and Ocheretny were married for almost 30 years, during which time Putin moved up the ranks of the KGB and its successor, the FSB, before he succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president in 1999.\n\nThe pair split “just weeks” before their 30th wedding anniversary, in June 2013, after Putin’s “16 and 17-hour days” took its toll on their family life, said the Daily Mirror.\n\nWho are Putin’s children?\n\nMaria Vorontsova\n\nPutin’s elder child Maria was born on 28 April 1985.

Nasdaq all dip as fears of a recession start surfacing", "text": "Stan Choe\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK – Fear swept through financial markets Thursday, and Wall Street tumbled as worries roared back to the fore that the world’s fragile economy may buckle under higher interest rates.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 3.3% in a widespread wipeout to more than reverse its blip of a 1.5% rally from a day before. Analysts had warned of more big swings given deep uncertainties about whether the Federal Reserve and other central banks can tiptoe the narrow path of hiking interest rates enough to get inflation under control but not so much that they cause a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4% and was briefly down more than 900 points, while the Nasdaq composite sank 4.1%. It was the sixth loss for the S&P 500 in its last seven tries, and all but 3% of the stocks in the index dropped.\n\nWall Street fell with stocks across Europe after central banks there followed up on the Federal Reserve’s big interest-rate hike on Wednesday. The Bank of England raised its key rate for the fifth time since December, though it opted for a more modest increase of 0.25 percentage points than the 0.75-point hammer brought by the Fed.\n\nSwitzerland’s central bank, meanwhile, raised rates for the first time in years, a half-point hike. Taiwan’s central bank raised its key rate by an eighth of a point. Japan’s central bank began a two-day meeting, though it’s held out on raising rates and making other economy-slowing moves that investors call “hawkish.”\n\nRisk and worry\n\nSuch moves and expectations for plenty more have sent investments tumbling this year, from bonds to bitcoin. Higher interest rates slow the economy by design, in hopes of stamping out inflation. But they’re a blunt tool that can choke off the economy if used too aggressively.\n\n“Another concern is that with the change in policy, there’s been weakening economic data already,” said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “That raises the odds of a recession in the latter part of 2022 into 2023.”\n\nThe worries dragged the S&P 500 into a bear market earlier this week, meaning it had dropped more than 20% from its peak. It’s now 23.6% below its record set early this year and back to where it was in late 2020. That effectively erases 2021, which was one of the best years for Wall Street since the turn of the millennium.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 123.22 points to 3,666.77. The Dow lost 741.46 to 29,927.07, and the Nasdaq dropped 453.06 to 10,646.10. Thursday’s biggest losses hit the stocks of the smallest companies, a signal of pessimism about the economy’s strength. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks sank 81.30, or 4.7%, to 1,649.84.\n\nNot only is the Federal Reserve hiking short-term rates, it also this month began allowing some of the trillions of dollars of bonds it purchased through the pandemic to roll off its balance sheet. That should put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates. It’s another way central banks have been ripping away supports they earlier propped underneath markets to juice the economy.\n\nInterest rate higher:How faster, bigger Fed rate hikes affect credit card, mortgage, savings rates and stocks\n\nBiggest hike since 1994:Federal Reserve increases key interest rate by 0.75% in biggest hike since 1994. What's that mean for economy and you?\n\nShared pain\n\nThe U.S. economy is still holding up, driven in particular by a strong jobs market. Fewer workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than a week before, a report showed on Thursday. But more signs of trouble have been emerging.\n\nOn Thursday, one report showed homebuilders broke ground on fewer homes last month. Rising mortgage rates resulting directly from the Fed’s moves are digging into the industry. A separate reading on manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region also unexpectedly fell.\n\n“Corporate earnings estimates have not yet changed to reflect some of the softening economic data and that could lead to the second leg of this repricing,” Northey said.\n\nTreasury yields swung sharply on Thursday, with the 10-year yield down to 3.23% from 3.39% late Wednesday. It had climbed as high as 3.48% in the morning, near its highest level since 2011.\n\nHigher rates have been delivering the hardest hits this year to the investments that soared the most through the easy, ultralow rates of earlier in the pandemic, which now looks to be among the most expensive and risky investments. That includes bitcoin and high-growth technology stocks.\n\nBig Tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market Thursday, but the sharpest losses hit stocks whose profits depend more on the strength of the economy and whether customers can keep up their purchases amid the highest inflation in decades.\n\nCruise operators Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival all lost more than 11%.\n\nIt’s all a sharp turnaround from a day earlier when stocks rallied immediately after the Fed’s biggest hike in rates since 1994. Analysts said investors seemed to latch onto a comment from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said mega-hikes of three-quarters of a percentage point would not be common.\n\nPowell said Wednesday the Fed is moving “expeditiously” to get rates closer to normal levels after last week’s stunning report that showed inflation at the consumer level unexpectedly accelerated last month, which dashed hopes that inflation may have already peaked.\n\nRELENTLESS GAS:With gas prices at $5 a gallon, Biden tells oil companies to cut costs for Americans\n\nPOSITIVE THINKING:'Never been more optimistic': Biden reassures Americans as inflation soars\n\nWHAT'S COMING?:Stagflation vs recession: What's the difference? Which is worse?\n\nThe Fed is “not trying to induce a recession now, let’s be clear about that,” Powell said. He called Wednesday’s big increase “front-end loading.”\n\n“Despite their assurance, it’s unclear to me whether the Fed has the tools they say they do to tamp down prices,” said Jason Brady, CEO of Thornburg Investment Management. He also said that even after its mega-hike on Wednesday, which was triple the usual amount, “the Fed is still behind.”\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Damian J.

Though inflation is a full percentage point above the target of 2% and unemployment stands at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, the British economy has come off the boil. It is the slowest among its peers in the Group of Seven industrialized democracies and businesses and households are becoming more cautious amid uncertainty over Britain’s future relations with the other 27 EU nations.\n\nThough Britain is officially due to leave the EU in March 2019, there is mounting pressure on the government to provide businesses with some clarity on the future following Brexit day. Many financial firms, for example, have threatened to start implementing contingency plans to set up operations in Europe or move staff and activities in the early months of next year if there is no progress in the Brexit talks.\n\nThe committee agreed there were “considerable risks” to the outlook related to Brexit and said “resolution” of that uncertainty “would prompt a reassessment.”\n\nFor now, the committee opted to look past those concerns by taking back the rate cut they pushed through in the aftermath of the Brexit vote to support the economy through the uncertainty and market turmoil of the time.\n\nAbove-target inflation lay at the heart of their vote. According to the bank’s quarterly projections, also published Thursday, annual inflation is set to rise to 3.2 percent in October. Anything more than a percentage point above target will require Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to write an explanatory letter to Treasury chief Philip Hammond.\n\nThose new forecasts see inflation falling toward the target, to 2.1 percent, over three years if the key interest rate rises, as expected by investors, to 1 percent. Without any further hike, the bank forecast that inflation would be around half a percentage point higher.\n\nInflation has been boosted in the past year by the pound’s 15 percent fall since the Brexit vote in June last year, which raised the cost of imported goods like food and energy. That impact is a one-off and is likely to fade in coming months.\n\nBut some at the central bank believe that a strong labor marker in Britain could help keep inflation higher, with wages are predicted to pick up to around 3%.\n\nFor two of the rate-setters, Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, there was insufficient evidence that domestic factors like wage increases would be as strong as anticipated, and that’s why they voted to keep rates on hold.\n\nThough the rate rise may not amount to much, it has symbolic value.\n\n“For a whole generation of U.K. households now entering adulthood, it’s a small but important reminder that interest rates can move in an upward direction, even if only slowly,” said Lucy O’Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.\n\nLenders are set to tweak their flexible mortgage rates to take account for the increase in the base rate. However, with more and more people taking out longer-term fixed-rate mortgages, the impact on household spending is not expected to be substantial.\n\nWhile the rate hike may stretch some household budgets, it will be welcome to savers, who have seen returns sharply diminished in the era of super-low interest rates. Nationwide Building Society, one of the country’s biggest financial institutions, said it will pass on the full quarter-point rise to savers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2022/05/05/stocks-fed-raised-interest-rates/9658485002/", "title": "Stocks slid a day after the Fed raised interest rates", "text": "Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Stocks closed sharply lower on Wall Street as worries grow in markets that the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is using in its fight against inflation will slow the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 pulled back 3.6%, erasing a rally from a day earlier and marking its biggest loss in almost two years. The Dow fell 1,063 points, or 3.1%. Tech stocks fell the most, pulling the Nasdaq down 5%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.04%.\n\nRising yields are sure to put upward pressure on mortgage rates, which are already at their highest level since 2009.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR INTEREST RATES?:Inflation is at a 40-year high. The Fed announced these aggressive moves to fight it\n\nWHAT RATE HIKES MEAN:How Fed's bigger, faster rate hikes will affect your credit card, mortgage, savings rates\n\nWhy are stocks down?\n\n“Yesterday’s sharp rally was not rooted in reality and today’s dramatic selloff is a reversal of that misplaced exuberance,” said Ben Kirby, co-head of investments at Thornburg Investment Management.\n\nWall Street’s breakneck day-to-day reversal reflects the degree of investors' uncertainty and unease over the array of threats the economy is facing, starting with inflation running at the highest level in four decades, and how effective the Federal Reserve’s bid to tame higher prices by jacking up interest rates will be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced a widely expected half-percentage point increase in its short-term interest rate.\n\nStocks bounced around following the move but then sharply rose as bond yields fell after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors by saying the central bank wasn’t considering shifting to more aggressive, three-quarters point rate hikes as the Fed continues with further rate increases in coming months.\n\nBut whatever relief Powell’s remarks gave stock investors vanished Thursday. Stocks slumped and bond yields climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.04%. Rising yields are sure to put upward pressure on mortgage rates, which are already at their highest level since 2009.\n\nInvestors remain uneasy about whether the Fed can do enough to tame inflation without tipping the economy, which is already showing signs of slowing, into a recession. In addition to high inflation and rising interest rates, investors are grappling with uncertainty over lingering supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions.\n\n“The biggest issue is there are just a lot of moving parts and the unanswered question is to what extent as the Fed attempts to tame inflation will that result in economic slowing, and perhaps, a recession,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nFed aggressively raises rates\n\nThe Fed’s aggressive shift to raise interest rates has investors worrying about whether it can pull off the delicate dance to slow the economy enough to halt high inflation but not so much as to cause a downturn. The pace and size of interest rate increases is being scrutinized closely on Wall Street.\n\n“Investors realized that by the Fed continuing to take a very measured approach, it could actually allow inflation to remain out of control,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n\nThe latest move by the Fed to raise interest rates by a half-percentage point had been widely expected. Markets steadied this week ahead of the policy update, but Wall Street was concerned the Fed might elect to raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at its next meeting. Powell eased those concerns, saying the central bank is “not actively considering” such an increase.\n\nThe central bank also announced that it will start reducing its huge $9 trillion balance sheet, which consists mainly of Treasury and mortgage bonds, starting June 1. Those large holdings are a policy tool the Fed uses to keep long-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, low.\n\nINVESTING TIPS:As odds rise for a recession, what's your investment strategy?\n\nARE WE IN A RECESSION?:What the GDP dip last quarter means for our economy\n\nWhen Powell said the Fed wasn’t considering a mammoth increase in short-term rates, that sent a signal to investors to send stock prices soaring and bond yields tumbling. A slower pace of interest-rate hikes would mean less risk of the economy tipping into recession, as well as less downward pressure on prices for all kinds of investments.\n\nBut diminishing the odds of a 0.75 point hike doesn’t mean the Fed is done raising rates steadily and sharply as it fights to tame inflation, not even close. Economists at BNP Paribas still expect the Fed to keep hiking the federal funds rate until it reaches a range of 3% to 3.25%, up from zero to 0.25% earlier this year.\n\n“We do not think this was Chair Powell’s intention,” economists at BNP Paribas wrote in a report, citing the market’s jubilance on Wednesday, “and we reckon we could see coming ‘Fedspeak’ seek to re-tighten financial conditions.”\n\nThe Bank of England on Thursday raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 13 years, its fourth rate hike since December as U.K. inflation runs at 30-year highs.\n\nTech stocks slide but energy is a bright spot\n\nEnergy markets remain volatile as the conflict in Ukraine continues and demand remains high amid tight supplies of oil. European governments are trying to replace energy supplies from Russia and are considering an embargo. OPEC and allied oil-producing countries decided Thursday to gradually increase the flows of crude they send to the world.\n\nHigher oil and gas prices have been contributing to the uncertainties weighing on investors as they try to assess how inflation will ultimately impact businesses, consumer activity and overall economic growth.\n\nHomebuilders fell broadly as average long-term home loan rates climbed. D.R. Horton slid 5.8%.\n\nThe average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 5.27% this week, its highest level since 2009, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year ago, it averaged 2.96%. Mortgage rates tend to follow moves in the 10-year Treasury yield.

That’s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\n\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\n\n“The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,” the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. “The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.”\n\nCAN I REPLACE MY PREMIUM GAS? My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular to save on high gas prices?\n\nRISING GAS THEFTS:Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\n\nDuring a video new conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials believe the economy can handle multiple rate hikes without slipping into recession.\n\n\"It's clearly time to raise interest rates,\" Powell said. \"We do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand\" higher rates.\n\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\n\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\n\nWednesday’s hike bumps up the federal funds rate – which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans – from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It’s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\n\nHow did rate hike affect stock market?\n\nImmediately following the Fed's decision stocks fell – but eventually reversed course.\n\nAfter trading higher leading up to the decision, the Dow Jones industrial briefly turned negative but closed 1.6%, or 519 points, higher Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite nearly wiped away their gains from earlier in the day. But the S&P 500 closed up 95 points, or 2.2%. And the Nasdaq rose 489 points, or 3.8%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose above 2.2% after the announcement. That's the highest level 10-year bond yields have been in three years. Hours later, yields fell to around 2.19%.\n\nSt. Louis Fed bank chief James Bullard dissented from the decision, saying he preferred to raise the rate by a half-point. In its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\"\n\nAlthough Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\n\n\"We have plans to raise interest rates steadily,\" he told reporters Wednesday, noting the Fed's forecast for six more hikes imply it will act at each remaining meeting this year. If the central bank needs to move more quickly, \"then we'll do so,\" he added, suggesting a half point hike is possible at some meetings.\n\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\n\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end – above its pre-pandemic level – and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected.\n\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices – Russia is among the world’s top oil producers – and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\n\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\n\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth – all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\n\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%, according to officials’ median projections. That’s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\n\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% -- well above its 2% target -- before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\n\nFed officials still expect unemployment, now 3.8%, to drop to its pre-pandemic mark of 3.5% – a 50-year low – by the end of this year and to remain at that level by the close of 2023. That suggests the Fed doesn't expect inflation or rising rates to derail the economy or job market.\n\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\n\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\n\nAlthough Powell said the Fed believes it can boost rates to lower inflation while maintaining a strong labor market, he made it clear that reining in inflation is the priority.\n\n\"The plan is to restore price stability,\" he said, noting it's necessary for low unemployment in the long run. \"Price stability is an essential goal.\"\n\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday’s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and “will have to head in a dramatically different direction” to “avoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.”\n\nWhat other moves did the Fed make?\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \"at a coming meeting\" after launching the bond-buying at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\n\nRather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\n\nWednesday’s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\n\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\n\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment – an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\n\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.\n\nContributing: Elisabeth Buchwald", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/05/03/fed-rate-hike-interest-debt-mortgages/9621177002/", "title": "Fed rate hike 2022: How interest rates will affect mortgages, loans", "text": "The Fed raised its key short-term rate from near zero by a quarter percentage point in March.\n\nOn Wednesday, the central bank is set to push it up another half point, its largest bump in 22 years.\n\nThe move will drive rates higher on everything from credit cards to mortgages.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Americans were facing sharply higher borrowing costs as the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to curb soaring inflation.\n\nNow the Fed is putting those rate increases on steroids, and consumers will have to dig even deeper into their wallets to pay off loans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/12/16/stocks-unsteady-wall-street-focus-inflation/8925606002/", "title": "Wall St. stocks unsteady as investors study banks fighting inflation", "text": "Damian J.

But the studio ultimately decided “Batgirl” didn’t merit either a streaming debut or a theatrical release, and has instead opted to entirely write off the film starring Grace and co-starring Michael Keaton (returning as Batman), J.K. Simmons and Brendan Fraser.\n\nUnder new Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive David Zaslav, Warner Bros. is shifting its strategy on film releases and trimming costs. Under previous chief executive Jason Kilar and partly as a pandemic response, the studio implemented day-and-date releases in 2021, opening films simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. Other films, like “Batgirl,” have been produced solely for HBO Max.\n\nThis year, Warner Bros. has returned to exclusive theatrical windows for at least 45 days before sending movies to HBO Max. While “Batgirl” isn’t as pricey as many superhero films, which typically cost $150-200 million to make, it’s a bigger budget movie for an HBO Max title. Zaslav has maintained larger budgeted movies are best served by a theatrical rollout. Yet marketing a movie like “Batgirl” for that kind of release would require tens of millions more. Warner Bros. Discovery is set to report second-quarter earnings Thursday.\n\n'The Batman':All of the big-screen Dark Knights (including Robert Pattinson), definitively ranked\n\nRepresentatives for Warner Bros. and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.\n\nWarner Bros. also shelved “Scoob!: Holiday Haunt,” an almost-completed sequel to 2020′s “Scoob!” Producer and writer Tony Cervone confirmed in an Instagram post Tuesday that the “Scoob!” film was canned.\n\n“Yes I am afraid this is true,” wrote Cervone. “The movie is practically finished and turned out beautifully. I am beyond heartbroken.”\n\nPrevious:Michael Keaton will reprise Batman role in upcoming HBO Max movie 'Batgirl'\n\nThe “Batgirl” cancellation comes as Warner Bros. is trying to revamp its DC Films operations. While “The Batman” earlier this year performed well with $770.8 million in ticket sales, Warners’ DC releases have been erratic and plagued by controversy. “The Flash,” scheduled for release next June, stars Ezra Miller who has been arrested twice this year in Hawaii, in a disorderly conduct case and on suspicion of assault.\n\nWarner Bros. is hoping to reorganize and reset its DC pipeline — going bigger, not smaller with its rival Marvel. Ultimately, “Batgirl” didn’t suit those plans.\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe, Charles Trepany, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/entertainment/scream-review/index.html", "title": "'Scream' pairs original cast members and new stars to refresh the ...", "text": "(CNN) Always meta in its nods to the genre's quirks, the latest \"Scream\" is so self-referential as to risk swallowing its own tail. Yet this quarter-century-later \"requel\" (a term specifically explained in the movie) turns out to be a great deal of fun, cleverly wedding familiar faces with new stars in what isn't exactly a remake or reboot but rather plays like a refresh.\n\nHorror has been one of the more reliable subgenres during the pandemic, but the current Omicron wave has complicated the calculus. Still, wherever people wind up seeing this designed-to-please slasher movie -- even if that's minus a crowd -- it should possess a healthy shelf life.\n\nHalf the battle was won, in hindsight, during the casting, tapping Melissa Barrera ( \"In the Heights\" ), Jenna Ortega (\"Stuck in the Middle\") and Jack Quaid ( \"The Boys\") for key roles among the younger contingent, while bringing back Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette in their original roles.\n\nThe trick comes in replicating elements of the original by the late director Wes Craven (to whom the movie's dedicated) and writer Kevin Williamson -- a horror flick that actually runs down the rules for surviving a horror flick, then watches the characters break them anyway -- updating that by overlaying the new on the old.\n\nAll that's achieved, fairly impressively, while simultaneously lampooning the original, its three sequels and that 25-year relationship with the audience, but still treating it with a level of every-detail-counts earnestness generally reserved for movies with superheroes or spaceships.

A swashbuckling road to the final included a Euro-record 22 goals scored and just two conceded, an 8-0 demolition of world No. 11 Norway and a 4-0 dismantling of the world's second-highest ranked team Sweden.\n\nWith head coach Sarina Wiegman having never lost a European Championship game -- nor a game in charge of England -- and Germany having never lost a Euro final, one record had to tumble at Wembley, the site of an agonizing defeat for the men's team at the same stage just over a year ago\n\nAnd despite only beating Germany twice in their previous 27 meetings, Wiegman's players battled to a hard-fought victory to extend the Dutch coach's impressive streak and spark scenes of pure, unbridled joy at the home of English football.\n\nThat euphoria was encapsulated by the celebrations of the matchwinner, who offered up one of the great post-match interviews when she spoke to the BBC.

As a young girl watching women's football, this is amazing. Thank you to everyone who played a part in my rehab. I always believed I would be here.\"\n\nCaptain Leah Williamson added: \"I just can't stop crying. We talk, we talk and we talk and we finally done it ... this is the proudest moment of my life.\n\n\"The legacy of this tournament is the change in society. The legacy of this team is winners and that is the journey. I love every single one of you, I'm so proud to be English.\"\n\nVictory marked the culmination of a 13-year-long redemption arc for midfielder Jill Scott, the only member of the Lionesses squad to have featured in the 6-2 mauling suffered at the hands of Germany in the 2009 final.\n\nSubbed on towards the end of regular time, the 35-year-old became the first England player to have played in two major international finals.\n\n\"I actually can't believe it,\" Scott said. \"We have an incredible group of staff. What a day. The young players have been fantastic, so grateful for every moment of this team.\n\n\"I don't think I'm going to sleep this week!\"\n\nEngland fans watching the game and celebrating in Trafalgar Square in London.\n\nAs congratulations poured in across social media, men's captain Harry Kane tweeted his appreciation, with particular praise for Toone, whose deftly chipped finish had put England ahead in the second-half.\n\n\"Absolutely unreal scenes at Wembley!! Massive congrats to the amazing Lionesses,\" Kane said. \"Ella Toone take a bow for that finish too.\"\n\nThere was also a message of congratulations from Queen Elizabeth II, who lauded the team for inspiring the next generation.\n\n\"The Championships and your performance in them have rightly won praise,\" she said . \"However, your success goes far beyond the trophy you have so deservedly earned.\n\n\"You have all set an example that will be an inspiration for girls and women today, and for future generations. It is my hope that you will be as proud of the impact you have had on your sport as you are of the result today.\"\n\nInjury agony for Popp\n\nGermany was struck a heartbreaking blow moments before kick-off when star striker Alexandra Popp, joint-top scorer at the tournament with six goals, suffered a muscle injury in the warm-up.\n\nReplaced in the starting 11 by Lea Schüller, it marked a devastating end to what had been a heartwarming redemption story for the 31-year-old. After missing the previous two Euros through injury, Popp had made up for lost time emphatically, matching the record for best goal tally at the tournament -- set by compatriot Inka Grings in 2009 -- with a game to spare.\n\nPopp's visible anguish as she left the pitch served as a stark contrast to the euphoric atmosphere of a sold-out Wembley Stadium as kick-off edged closer, with singers Becky Hill, Steflon Don and Ultra Naté taking to the center circle to host the pre-match show.\n\nWith the surrounding area of the ground teeming with fans and flags several hours before kick-off, it was a fitting build-up to the close of a tournament that had smashed records well before the trophy had been lifted.\n\nThe total of 487,683 fans that had attended the games preceding the final more than doubled the previous tournament attendance record set at Euro 2017 in the Netherlands.\n\nAnd that was before the historic numbers boost at Wembley, which smashed the existing high for a men's or women's Euro final set at Madrid's Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in 1964.\n\nIt was a record-breaking attendance for a European Championship final -- men's or women's -- at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nBuoyed by home support, England started on the front foot. Fran Kirby carved out an early chance with a teasing cross for Ellen White at the back post, but the Manchester City forward could only direct her header into the arms of Merle Frohms.\n\nIt would mark the first of a string of opportunities for White in a cagey first half of few gilt-edge chances, with both defenses continuing the iron-fisted form that had seen them arrive at Wembley having conceded just once all tournament.\n\nAggravated by a quick succession of yellow cards for Georgia Stanway and White, frustration quickly turned to fear for England as a flicked on corner caused carnage on the goal line. Pinballing around inches from the line, the ball looked destined to settle in the net before it was gratefully smothered by England keeper Mary Earps.\n\nDealing with players' complaints would set the tone for a busy day for referee Kateryna Monzul, who dished out six yellow cards and stopped play for 36 fouls throughout a combative, hard-fought contest.\n\nEngland's best chance of the half came five minutes before the break as a cut back from Beth Mead found White surging into the box, but the off-balance 33-year-old couldn't keep her shot down.\n\nEcstasy\n\nIt was Germany's turn to fly out of the blocks following the restart, with Tabea Wassmuth almost punishing Millie Bright for a miscommunication just two minutes into the second half. But having raced away down the left, Wassmuth could only fire her shot straight at Earps.\n\nWiegman rang the changes as Germany continued its fast start, Kirby and White making way for Toone and Alessia Russo. With four goals -- all from the bench -- Russo had been the tournament's unofficial 'golden' sub before the final, but it was Toone who would steal the crown at Wembley.\n\nAfter a perfectly weighted long ball from Keira Walsh split the German defense, the Manchester United attacker found herself in the clear, faced by the onrushing form of Frohms. Her response? The most exquisite of chips that lifted over the goalkeeper and in.\n\nKelly scoring England's Euro-winning goal in the final against Germany at Wembley Stadium on July 31.\n\nIf the finish was deft, the response was anything but, as Wembley erupted in ecstatic scenes not witnessed under the arch since Luke Shaw's strike had fired the men's team into an early lead at the opposite end of the pitch just over a year ago.\n\nLike so many England tournaments before, that story ended in tears, and another painful chapter looked on course to be penned when Magull fired home a deserved equalizer 10 minutes from time.\n\nWith Wiegman's side dropping ever deeper to protect their advantage, the pressure finally broke when a well-worked move saw Wassmuth slide a low cross into the Bayern Munich midfielder at the near post, who smartly poked into the roof of the net to level.\n\nMagull went close again in a nail-biting finish to regular time, with the euphoric atmosphere mere minutes ago replaced by one of nervous tension, broken momentarily by a rousing reception for the introduction of Scott.\n\nGermany players celebrate Magull's equalizer.\n\nHomecoming\n\nTempers flared during a nervy extra-time of few chances and many crunching tackles, with Scott involved in an angry exchange with Sydney Lohmann after she had tripped the German.\n\nAs legs tired and penalties crept closer, England forced a corner with 10 minutes to play. Lucy Bronze knocked the ball down into the path of Kelly who, after one missed swipe, poked the ball over the line for her first international goal at the most timely of times.\n\nCue pure bedlam, momentarily frozen by Kelly pausing to check with referee Monzul that her goal had counted. Ripping off her shirt in celebration, the 24-year-old was issued with what will surely be the most warmly received yellow card of her career.\n\nDogged efforts to keep the ball in the corner ran down the clock as the Wembley crowd willed their players over the line, Monzul's final whistle sparking the biggest roar yet.\n\nRight on time, \"Three Lions\" blasted through the stadium speakers.

Around 87,000 fans are set to be at the home of English football, which would smash the current attendance record for a Euros final -- men's or women's -- of 79,115, set at the 1964 final between Spain and the Soviet Union at the Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nUEFA, European football's governing body, says nearly 100,000 children have attended matches so far at Euro 2022, while 47% of all fans have been women.\n\nOf course, it certainly helps that home fans have been fortunate enough to watch arguably the most talented England women's side of all time.\n\nThe 8-0 dismantling of a dangerous Norway side, ranked just two places below England, and the 4-0 drubbing of Sweden, the second-best team in the world and a team England had previously beaten just three times, will go down as some of the most eye-catching in the Lionesses' history.\n\nBut the path to the final wasn't always a straightforward one. England struggled to find its rhythm in a tough opening win against Austria, before being pushed all the way in a comeback win over Spain in the quarterfinals.\n\nChloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp celebrate following the 8-0 win over Norway.\n\nEngland, though, will certainly be glad it has been put to the test ahead of its most difficult match yet. Germany boasts a quite extraordinary record in the European Championship, winning eight of the 12 editions that have been contested and reigned over the Euros crown for 22 years until defeat at the quarterfinal stage in the Netherlands five years ago.\n\nHead coach Sarina Wiegman, who guided her native Netherlands to victory at Euro 2017, is well aware of how important an England win on Sunday could be for women's football in the country.\n\n\"I think we have been an inspiration for the country already,\" she told reporters on Friday, per Reuters . \"You know when you win a major tournament it really makes a difference and that would make me very proud. But I don't think further than that. Most of the time you don't realise the impact until probably 15 years later.\n\n\"We approach this game exactly the same as every other game we have played. We don't talk about the rivalry between England and Germany; we want to show how good we are and play our best game.\n\n\"There's so much eagerness in this team to win, and so much resilience. We want so badly to show again we are the best and to play our best game. That's what we've been trying to do all the time and then hopefully, that will bring us to win.\"\n\n'Nothing left to lose'\n\nAlexandra Popp, who has become Germany's star with six goals in five games at these Euros, is one of the best feel-good stories of the summer.\n\nThe 31-year-old missed the Euros in 2013 and 2017 through injury and, for a while, it looked as though she might miss this one after injuring her knee last year, but Popp was finally able to compete when the tournament was postponed by a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nShe has certainly made up for lost time and was visibly emotional after scoring in the opening win against Denmark, sinking to her knees and covering her face with her hands.\n\nAlexandra Popp's six goals at Euro 2022 equals the all-time record at a single tournament.\n\nPopp's six goals at Euro 2022, matched only by England's Beth Mead, equals the previous best goal haul at a single Euros, set by compatriot Inka Grings at Finland 2009.\n\n\"I think the pressure is more on the English side, precisely because it takes place in their own country,\" Popp told reporters at a press conference on Friday. \"We know that from 2011 [when Germany hosted the World Cup], suddenly everyone expects something from you.\n\n\"We have nothing left to lose. With that attitude we can go into the game completely free.\"\n\nThere certainly seem to be no nerves in the German camp ahead of the final, with Popp turning up to the press conference wearing a mustache hidden under her mask. \"Hello,\" she said, greeting reporters in a gruff voice.\n\nAfter her match-winning performance against France in the semifinals, German outlets FUMS and Der Postillon ran satirical posts saying that men's national team head coach Hansi Flick had called up a new striker for Qatar, accompanied by a photo of Popp in a mustache with the pseudonyms Alexander Bopp and Alexander Papp.\n\nThe forward will no doubt be the biggest threat England faces on the Wembley pitch come Sunday and it's likely a moment of instinct from Popp or Mead could decide the game.\n\nThese two teams boast a brilliant defensive record at this tournament, having each conceded just one goal, and it's likely their stingy back lines will be difficult to breach in the final.\n\nAlexandra Popp wore a fake mustache to her pre-match press conference on Friday.\n\n'Outstanding'\n\nThe quality on display at Euro 2022 only emphasizes the accelerated growth of the women's game across the continent in recent years, as football federations have finally started to seriously invest in their teams.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who says he has been closely following Germany's progress, said women's football as \"exploded\" in recent years.\n\n\"I really have to say I love women's football, it's outstanding,\" Klopp said at a press conference on Thursday.\n\n\"The quality of the tournament is insane. England is doing exceptionally well. I saw three games of Germany, they've been doing really well as well. It's a really good final -- two intense teams facing each other.\n\n\"As much as I love England, in this specific case my heart is on the German side, but the better team might win and I'm completely fine with that. At a sold out Wembley with an English crowd, it will be a massive challenge for Germany.\n\n\"Most important is the face women's football showed, it's a fantastic game. Women's football, over the last few years, exploded in their development. It's tactically and technically on an incredibly high level. The intensity of the games -- physically it's really, really good and I love watching it.\n\n\"England are slight favorites playing at home, but Germany has a chance.\"\n\nAfter defeat in the men's Euros final last summer, England fans will be desperate to avoid double heartbreak.

From day one, we wanted to win the tournament, but at the same time, we realized that we had to shut out the whole outside world.\n\n\"We didn't even know how crazy it was going to be, and it's turned out to be 10 times crazier than we all thought ... We just were so focused on training and enjoying each other's company, switching off and then going again.\"\n\nEngland players celebrate in London's Trafalgar Square following their victory against Germany.\n\nWhat also helped, Russo says, was the influence of manager Sarina Wiegman, who has yet to lose a game with England, nor at the Women's Euros having also led Netherlands to victory in 2017.\n\n\"I think we all love playing under her,\" says Russo. \"She has like a real calmness about her. She's very relaxed and off the pitch and even on the sidelines. She doesn't really get too heated or too in the moment -- she's very level-headed.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old Russo has largely been used as a substitute throughout her England career and was brought off the bench in all six of the Lionesses' Euro 2022 games.\n\nHer fourth and final goal of the tournament was the most memorable -- a sublime, instinctive back-heel through the legs of Sweden's goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl which put the gloss on England's 4-0 semifinal win.\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever score a goal like that again,\" says Russo. \"I think it was just a one-time wonder, but I'll take.\"\n\nRusso lines up her back-heel against Sweden.\n\nThe goal quickly earned plaudits from across the women's game and beyond, including catching the attention of US great Abby Wambach and Chelsea and Australia star Sam Kerr.\n\n\"I saw my old club that I grew up playing with -- they were all practicing at training, which was nice,\" Russo adds.\n\n\"And if it's a goal or whatever, it's nice to see that women's football's leaving a mark on the world and on young boys and girls. If it's inspired one person to go out and play football, I'll take it.\"\n\nNot gonna lie, that was lit from Russo — Sam Kerr (@samkerr1) July 26, 2022\n\nWatch the goal back -- and the wild celebrations that followed -- and it's hard not to be inspired by Russo and the Lionesses.\n\nThe future of women's football in England looks bright, but before Russo can begin to contemplate what it might hold, she has more immediate priorities.\n\n\"There's definitely a holiday coming up,\" she says. \"It's been an amazing few months, but I'm very exhausted and need a little break.\"", "authors": ["George Ramsay", "Amanda Davies"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/football/england-sweden-womens-euro-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Women's Euro 2022: England reaches final with stunning win over ...", "text": "(CNN) England's women banished the heartbreak of their two recent major semifinal defeats by beating Sweden 4-0 to reach the final of Euro 2022.\n\nIt didn't all go host England's way, however, as Sarina Wiegman's side had to weather some serious first-half pressure from a world class Sweden side.\n\nBut Beth Mead's smart turn and finish after the half-hour mark settled England's obvious nerves and from then on there only looked like being one winner.\n\nLucy Bronze's header from a corner early in the second half and then a stunning back-heeled goal from substitute Alessia Russo sent the 28,624 fans inside Bramall Lane into rapture, before Fran Kirby's lob added gloss to an already remarkable scoreline.\n\nSweden, after all, is currently ranked second in the world, with England only previously recording three wins over Sweden in its entire history.\n\nIn what has already been a record-breaking tournament for attendances and viewing figures, Tuesday's game set a new record attendance for a Euros semifinal.\n\nAfter defeats in the semifinals at the 2019 World Cup, Euro 2017, England will now play in the final against either Germany or France at Wembley Stadium on July 31.\n\nEngland striker Beth Mead celebrates after scoring her team's first goal against Sweden.\n\n\"I think they have shown a couple of times they are very resilient,\" Wiegman told the BBC . \"We didn't start well, we had a hard time.\n\n\"We found a way. The players in the game found a way to get out of their pressure. I'm so incredibly proud of them.\"\n\nSlow starters\n\nThe nerves that were evident for much of the quarterfinal against Spain were again on display in the early stages against Sweden.\n\nEngland goalkeeper Mary Earps was called into action inside the opening minute, blocking Sofia Jakobsson's effort after Georgia Stanway had been caught in possession in midfield.\n\nAnother smart save from Earps once again kept the scores level just minutes later, this time palming Stina Blackstenius' bobbled effort around the post. From the resulting corner, Sweden had its best chance yet as Blackstenius this time beat Earps to the ball, but her header could only find the crossbar.\n\nWith England looking to dominate possession, Sweden was posing a real threat on the counter. The attacking trio of Blackstenius, Kosovare Asllani and Fridolina Rolfo in particular were giving England's defenders nightmares, pulling them this way and that with their interchanging runs.\n\nBy the half hour mark, England had barely registered a chance worth mentioning. In fact, the highlight of the Lionesses' opening 30 minutes was a stunning sliding tackle from Kirby, who had tracked back the length of the pitch to deny Sweden a clear goalscoring chance.\n\nFran Kirby put the icing on the cake with a fourth goal late on.\n\nEngland manager Wiegman once again named the same starting XI she had for the first four games of Euro 2022, unperturbed by the somewhat toothless display for much of the quarterfinal against Spain.\n\nWiegman needed all of her tactical nous to turn that game around with substitutions, but her trusty top scorer Mead made sure that wouldn't be necessary this time.\n\nWith 10 minutes left to play in the first half, England found the breakthrough seemingly out of nowhere. After Lauren Hemp's cross into the box missed Ellen White's boot by an inch, Bronze did well to keep the ball in play and put it back into the penalty area.\n\nMead took one touch, swiveled and drilled the ball into the far corner to send Bramall Lane crowd into delirium. It was a wonderful goal, perhaps her best of the tournament so far, and put her into outright first place in the race for the Golden Boot with six goals.\n\nIt also equaled the most goals scored at a single European Championship, matching Inka Grings' tally from Finland 2009.\n\nMore importantly, however, it finally settled England's nerves and for the first time in the match Wiegman's team began to dominate. Chances came for Kirby and Stanway, but neither were able to test Rut Hedvig Lindahl in the Sweden goal from distance.\n\nWhen the half-time whistle came, it was Sweden that was relieved to hear it and England was now just 45 minutes minutes away from the final.\n\nMary Earps kept England level with some brilliant early saves.\n\nRelentless Lionesses\n\nThe second half began in identical fashion and England immediately had its opponent on the back foot once more.\n\nIt was again Hemp down the left causing Sweden all sorts of problems and the Manchester City winger's cross into Mead was blocked behind by a Swedish boot. However, a towering header from Lucy Bronze from the resulting corner sneaked its way in past the far post and put England in complete control of this semifinal.\n\nRusso has been England's supersub in this tournament, registering three goals off the bench so far. When she was brought on before the hour mark against Sweden, her impact was immediate as a driving run and low cross found Hemp at the far post.\n\nBut with the goal gaping, the winger could only divert an effort onto the crossbar.\n\nSweden did have a wonderful chance to half the deficit, but Earps' full-stretch fingertip save denied Blackstenius a goal.\n\nAlessia Russo's wonderful improvision made it 3-0 to England.\n\nHowever, with just over 20 minutes left to play, the match was ended as a contest by a moment of genius from Russo. After her initial effort -- which she should have scored -- was blocked by Lindahl, Russo improvised with a cheeky backheel that caught the Swedish keeper completely off guard as it squeezed through her legs.\n\nIt was a piece of magic that encapsulated the very best of this England team as it began to dismantle one of the best teams in the world.\n\nKirby soon added the icing on the cake with just over 15 minutes left to play, lobbing the ball from range over Lindahl. The Swedish keeper really should have done better, but let the ball squirm through her hands, capping off a night she will want to forget in a hurry.\n\nThe victory continues Wiegman's remarkable personal record of never having lost a game at a Euros.

To put the country's dominance in this competition into context, of the 12 editions of the Women's Euros that have been contested, Germany has won eight of them.\n\nThis iteration of the national team is desperate to take its country back to the pinnacle of European international football and has recorded a couple of impressive results at Euro 2022 thanks largely to its stingy defense, which was yet to concede a goal at the tournament.\n\nConversely, France has very little Euros experience. Wednesday's match marked the first time it had reached the semifinals of a European Championship and the team had endured a bumpy road to get there.\n\nKadidiatou Diani's deflected shot saw France level against Germany.\n\nFirst, there was significant surprise when it was announced that stalwart midfielder Amandine Henry had been left out of the squad for this tournament, which sparked reports of discontent within the French camp, before star striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto suffered an ACL injury in the group stages.\n\nBut to France's credit, there were no early signs that this team was to be overawed by the occasion or its opponent.\n\nThe opening 20 minutes were a tense affair as both teams began the game by just feeling each other out. Neither side seemed willing to commit enough bodies forward to truly trouble the other, but France began showing flashes of the danger it possesses on the counterattack.\n\nWingers Delphine Cascarino and Kadidiatou Diani in particular were posing a threat to Germany's so far unbeatable back line.\n\nHowever, it was Germany that mustered the first meaningful effort of the game as Alexandra Popp's wicked free-kick was brilliantly tipped around the post by goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin.\n\nIt was a testament to the quality of the save that a number of German fans inside the stadium had already begun to rise out of their seats in celebration, only to be left disappointed by Peyraud-Magnin's fingertips.\n\nThe sizable group of French fans in the corner to the right of Peyraud-Magnin's goal had the perfect view of their goalkeeper's heroics and cheered with approval, before leading a large portion of the stadium in chants of \"Allez Les Bleus.\"\n\nBut with the game meandering towards half-time, a moment of quality five minutes before the whistle broke the deadlock seemingly from nothing.\n\nSvenja Huth's cross into the box was met by Popp, whose instinctive dash into the six-yard box allowed her to beat French defender Eve Perisset to the ball and stab it into the roof of the net.\n\nGermany's players celebrate Popp's opening goal of the match.\n\nFrance responds\n\nIt was certainly a goal this game needed and it was one that sparked the contest to life.\n\nAfter waiting 40 minutes for the first goal to come, the 27,445 inside Stadium MK only had to wait five minutes for the second.\n\nDiani thought she had scored the goal that her early efforts merited, but replays showed her long-range effort hit the post and bounced into the goal off German goalkeeper Frohms, who was credited with an unfortunate own goal.\n\nThat certainly helped France feel like it belonged on this stage and the team emerged from the half-time break with a new-found intensity.\n\nJust after the hour mark, substitute Selma Bacha had a wonderful chance to put her side ahead, controlling the ball and swiveling smartly in the box, but she was denied by a brilliant block from defender Kathrin-Julia Hendrich.\n\nFrom the resulting corner, the towering Wendy Renard got up at the far post but her header was smothered away on the line.\n\nThe chances were now coming thick and fast for France as a frustrated German side began to make mistakes. Bacha was again denied from a narrow angle, this time by the legs of goalkeeper Frohms.\n\nThe French fans sensed an upset was on the cards and the chants of \"Allez Les Bleus\" now reververbated louder than ever around the ground.\n\nBut, even with its back up against the wall, Germany is a relentless force to be reckoned with at the Euros.\n\nGerman players celebrate after the final whistle.\n\nNo team in any European competition can come close to matching Germany's record in this tournament and years of dominance have given this national team a remarkable self-belief.\n\nWhen all the signs were pointing to a France win, Popp appeared once again on the end of a Huth cross to give Germany the lead, this time powering a header past Peyraud-Magnin.\n\nAs Popp pumped her fists in front of a delirious section of Germany fans, the French players looked shell-shocked and despondent, heads bowed as they made their way back to the center circle.\n\nThere were still more chances to come for both teams, but a German victory now felt inevitable.\n\nWhen the full-time whistle went, many of Germany's players collapsed to the floor, exhausted from the physical and emotional exertion it took to dispatch a France team that will no doubt be a major force on the international stage for a while to come.\n\nOne more grueling test awaits for Germany against England on Sunday -- perhaps its most difficult yet -- but the eight-time champion will be in no doubt it can make that nine.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2022/07/28/england-and-germany-set-for-historic-euro-2022-final/50536437/", "title": "England and Germany set for historic Euro 2022 final", "text": "AP\n\nLONDON (AP) — England against Germany at Wembley Stadium. A final that underlines the growing stature of women's soccer in Europe and echoes decades of history.\n\nWhen host nation England takes on Germany in the European Championship final Sunday, it will have a tournament-record crowd of nearly 90,000. Euro 2022 as a whole will be easily the best-attended ever. It beat the previous mark of 240,000 part-way through the group stage.\n\n“It's going to be a great festival of football,” German coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg said Wednesday. “That's a classic in soccer, England-Germany.\"\n\nEngland is aiming to win its first major women's tournament title on the site where the English men's national team beat West Germany to win its only major title to date, the 1966 World Cup.\n\nGermany has won all eight European finals it's played — and crushed England 6-2 in the 2009 final — but its momentum had seemed to slow in recent years as other countries invested heavily in women's leagues.\n\nWHAT IT MEANS\n\nEngland has scored a tournament-leading 20 goals on its way to the final, more than half in two storming wins over former European champions, 8-0 against Norway in the group stage and 4-0 against Sweden in the semifinals.\n\nBeating eight-time winner Germany would be the perfect way for England to write history.\n\nEngland showed it is possible back in February, winning 3-1 in Wolverhampton for its first-ever victory against Germany on home soil.\n\nGermany's fans are used to their team winning titles, even if it's not quite the all-conquering dynasty it once was. Since Germany won the Olympic gold medal in 2016, Euro 2022 marks the first time it has got past the quarterfinals of a tournament.\n\nTHE KEY PLAYERS\n\nForwards Alexandra Popp and Alessia Russo have made very different contributions. Captain Popp has scored in each of Germany's five games — a new record — and started all except the opening game against Denmark. Russo has started none but is the ultimate impact substitute.\n\nAfter missing the 2013 and 2017 European Championships with injuries, Popp is making up for lost time as the joint top scorer with England's Beth Mead on six goals. Popp has her club teammates around her as one of five Wolfsburg players in the starting lineup for the 2-1 win over France, when she scored twice.\n\nPopp started out as a full back at now-defunct FCR Duisburg and won her first European club title aged 18. She studied at a sports-focused high school with a special permission to let her take soccer classes as the only girl alongside boys from the academy of men's club Schalke, and is also a fully qualified zookeeper.\n\nRusso's explosive impact off the bench has been crucial. The Manchester United forward, who played college soccer at the University of North Carolina, has scored four goals as a substitute at Euro 2022, including a backheel through the goalkeeper's legs against Sweden in the semifinals. Her assist for Ella Toone's goal to send the quarterfinal against Spain to extra time was just as valuable.\n\n“I think when you’re enjoying your football you play your best,\" Russo said. \"Maybe (the backheel against Sweden) does show a bit of confidence — but I’m just loving playing football.”\n\nTHE COACHES\n\nEngland's Sarina Wiegman and Germany's Voss-Tecklenburg have already secured a place in history as players and coaches.\n\nVoss-Tecklenburg has been a driving force in German soccer for decades — 125 games played for the national team and four European titles, a UEFA Women's Cup (now the Champions League) title as coach in 2009, even five years editing a women's soccer magazine.\n\nShe has noted England's slow start against Sweden in the semifinal, when the hosts were on the defensive. “The first 30 minutes against Sweden showed that you can hurt (England), and that will be our task,” she said.\n\nWiegman played 99 times for the Netherlands and coached the Dutch to the 2017 European title before joining England, and is still unbeaten in 11 games as coach at the championships.\n\n“We said before the tournament and we still say it every time that we want to inspire the nation,\" Wiegman said. \"I think that’s what we’re doing and we want to make a difference, and we hope that we will get everyone so enthusiastic and proud of us and that even more girls and boys start playing football.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2022/08/01/thousands-turn-up-to-welcome-german-team-back-from-euro-2022/50552883/", "title": "Thousands turn up to welcome German team back from Euro 2022", "text": "AP\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Germany’s narrow loss to England in the Women's European Championship final may yet prove more beneficial for women’s soccer in the country than another title would have been.\n\nThe team was given a heroes’ welcome back in Frankfurt on Monday, when thousands of flag-waving fans turned up in front of the city hall to show their appreciation for coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg and her players.\n\n“It’s crazy that a performance is recognized over several weeks and not only with a win,” Voss-Tecklenburg said.\n\nChloe Kelly’s goal in extra time denied Germany a ninth European title and gave England its first – setting off euphoric celebrations in that country – but the German team’s run to the final stoked great excitement among fans, not least because the men have flopped at major tournaments since winning the 2014 World Cup.\n\nAn average of nearly 18 million viewers watched Sunday’s final on German broadcaster ARD, breaking an 11-year-old record for women’s soccer from the 2011 World Cup. Viewing figures for Euro 2022 increased as Germany progressed to the final. Just over 12 million saw the semifinal win over France.\n\nAlexandra Popp, who scored six goals to steer her team into the final at Wembley, missed the decider after reporting a muscle problem in the warmup. It gave Germany’s loss a sense of tragedy without its captain, further endearing the team to its fans.\n\n“We actually wanted to be European champions and not the champions of hearts,” Voss-Tecklenburg said. “But if the great performances helped us play our way into the hearts of the German people, then we’re happy to be champions of hearts.”\n\nPride in the performances and the disappointment of losing led some to accuse the German soccer federation of not doing enough to support female players and of treating women’s soccer as an afterthought compared to the men’s.\n\n“The fact that there’s no real awareness is shown when three games in the (men’s) German Cup are scheduled at the same time as the women’s final in Wembley,” Greens parliamentary group spokeswoman Britta Haßelmann told news agency DPA. “The support for young soccer-loving girls and women has to be massively increased. It can’t fail due to financial resources at the federation. It really needs to get going now.”\n\nGovernment spokesman Wolfgang Büchner said it plans to do more for women’s soccer, though he didn’t get into specifics. He said Germany’s performances in England meant it was “a role model for many women in sports and also in other areas of society.”\n\nGerman soccer league chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke said he hopes Voss-Tecklenburg’s team’s run to the final – and the interest it generated at home – will have a knock-on effect for the women’s Bundesliga, where spectator numbers are usually quite low.\n\n“Tournaments are nice and important, but ideally they should reflect on everyday sporting life. I’d like that very much because I see the immense commitment put into women’s soccer. But in the end it’s always the same – you vote with your feet,” Watzke told Kicker magazine.\n\nWatzke, who is also chief executive of men’s heavyweight Borussia Dortmund, referred to the low income generated by women’s soccer compared to the men’s game when it comes to the debate on equal pay for male and female players.\n\n“It’s obvious that equal pay is the goal. But with equal revenue,” Watzke said.\n\nSpeaking to daily tabloid Bild, the Germany and Bayern Munich player Lina Magull called for female players in the first and second divisions to be given a minimum wage.\n\n“We players should earn enough from the second division so that nobody has to work part-time anymore. We’re talking about a minimum salary of 2,000 or 3,000 euros a month,” Magull said. “This is how you can advance the development of women’s soccer sustainably.”\n\nAddressing the homecoming German team in Frankfurt, German soccer federation president Bernd Neuendorf said the players’ efforts at Euro 2022 had inspired a new beginning for women’s soccer in the country.\n\n“We experienced the end of a tournament on Sunday, but also the start of something quite big. We can all be happy about that,” Neuendorf said. “Of course, we hope that we will bring many women and young girls into football through this wonderful tournament.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/football/germany-austria-quarterfinal-womens-euro-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Women's Euro 2022: Germany through to semifinals with 2-0 win ...", "text": "(CNN) Germany's vastly experienced captain and star striker Alexandra Popp is featuring in her first ever Women's Euro after missing the 2013 and 2017 tournaments due to injury.\n\nPopp is making up for lost time, becoming only the second player ever to score in four consecutive Euro matches and sealing Germany's 2-0 victory against Austria to seal its place in the semifinals with her 90th minute goal.\n\n\"I had a very hard time last year [with injury] -- I'm very thankful to be here.

Here's what you need to ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) The United States is on the brink of a retirement crisis. The primary savings tool for Americans -- your 401(k) -- isn't helping.\n\nBy the end of the decade, about 21% of the country's population will be 65 or older, up from 15% in 2016, according to forecasts by the Census Bureau. Most non-retired adults have some type of retirement savings, but only 36% think their savings are on track\n\nNow, Congress is looking to help Americans save by bolstering 401(k) programs -- the tax-deferred, company-sponsored retirement accounts to which employees can contribute income, and employers can match their contributions.\n\nA new bill, expected to reach President Joe Biden's desk by the end of the year, could require most employer-sponsored retirement plans to enroll their workers automatically, making it easier for student-loan borrowers to save, and for older workers to make catch-up contributions. It will also lower costs for smaller businesses.\n\nRetirement savings in the United States were long thought of as a three-legged stool. Americans had pension plans, Social Security benefits, and defined contribution plans like the 401(k). Not any more.\n\nfaced a decades long political stalemate on how to fix it. Social Security payments still provide about 90% of income for a quarter of older adults, according to Social Security Agency surveys . But the Social Security trust fund is facing a 75-year deficit, and without intervention it will be depleted by the mid-2030s . Lawmakers havefaced a decades long political stalemate on how to fix it.\n\nWhat's left is the 401(k), which 68% of private industry workers have access to, but only 50% use.\n\n\"I don't think it was ever anticipated that this would be the primary leg of the stool,\" said Jonathan Barber, head of compensation and benefits policy research at Ayco Personal Financial Management, a unit of Goldman Sachs that provides investment services to hundreds of US companies and more than a million corporate employees.\n\nIndeed, the 401(k) was never designed to be the primary retirement tool for Americans when it was introduced into the US tax code in 1978. \"When it works, it works really well,\" said Sri Reddy, senior vice president of retirement and income solutions for Principal Financial Group.\n\nThe 401(k) naturally appeals as a savings vehicle to Americans who bring in more money, say critics. Under the current plan, an employee in the highest tax bracket saves 37%. But an employee in the lowest tax bracket would gain a pre-tax advantage of saving only 10% on deferred income.\n\nThe tax breaks for these retirement savings are expected to cost the government nearly $200 billion this year , with most of those benefits going to the top 20% of earners, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nLess than 40% of lower-paid workers have retirement accounts, compared with 80% of middle- and upper-income families, according to Vanguard . Making a 401(k) plan more accessible doesn't help Americans who don't have money to save in the first place.\n\nStill, Congress thinks there's a solution.\n\nIn late 2019, one of the most significant pieces of retirement legislation in the past 15 years, was signed into law by President Donald Trump: the bipartisan Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement, or SECURE Act. The bill removed maximum age limits on retirement contributions, provided tax credits for small businesses to offer their employees 401(k) plans, and extended retirement benefits to some long-term but part-time employees.\n\nLast week Congress almost unanimously passed another bill, SECURE 2.0, that has even broader changes. The Senate is expected to pass its version in the coming weeks.\n\nHere's a look at how the primary retirement savings plan in the US may soon change.\n\nAutomatic enrollment\n\nIn what would be the largest change to the 401(k) program, SECURE 2.0 would require employers to automatically enroll all eligible workers into their 401(k) plans at a savings rate of 3% of salary. (Many employees currently have to opt in and then choose their contribution level.) The new rule also applies to the 403(b), a similar program for employees of certain public and tax-exempt organizations.\n\nEnrolled workers' contribution rates would be automatically increased each year by 1% until their contribution reaches 10% annually.\n\nWhile workers have the option to opt out of the plan or change their contribution level after they enroll, automatically enrolling workers into these plans would make a huge change in younger and low-waged employees' participation in the program.\n\nA 2012 study cited in the SECURE 2.0 bill found that, \"[t]he most dramatic increases in enrollment rates are among younger, low-paid employees, and the racial gap in participation rates is nearly eliminated among employees subject to auto-enrollment.\"\n\nAbout one in six of employers already offer automatic enrollment, and about 90% of new hires who use them participate in retirement plans, compared with just 28% under voluntary enrollment, according to a recent study by Vanguard, the largest provider of mutual funds in the United States.\n\nPre-retirees save more\n\nOlder workers who are between the ages of 62 and 64 can increase their catch-up contributions to $10,000 a year, up from $6,500 now. Beginning in 2023, these catch-up contributions would be taxed as Roth contributions, meaning they'd be taxed before being invested for retirement, though earnings would be indexed to inflation.\n\nPeople generally earn more as they age, said Reddy, and people in their 60s are typically earning more than they spend. Giving them the ability to increase their contributions makes a huge difference in retirement savings. \"If you have people who are motivated and have incremental means, it's a wonderful way of helping them get caught up for retirement,\" he said.\n\nBarber, who heads up benefits research at Goldman Sachs' Ayco Personal Financial Management, worries that this change may be overly complex.\n\nCurrently, most 401(k) contributions come from employees' paychecks pre-tax, so investors don't really feel the bite until they're ready to withdraw their savings. Under the new plan, the catch-up contribution will be raised, but employees must pay taxes before they contribute.\n\nFor investors, \"that might be a shock to some people who don't understand the financial impact of that, especially if they've never had a Roth account,\" said Barber.\n\nPay off student loan debt while saving\n\nAbout 43.4 million borrowers in the United States have federal student loan debt, totaling a whopping $1.7 trillion, and many employees tend to forgo saving for retirement until they pay their loans in full.\n\nLosing out on those early years of potential savings puts them at a significant disadvantage. The plan has a solution to that.\n\nEmployers could treat student loan repayments as elective retirement account deferrals, and provide a matching contribution to their 401(k). So if you pay off $1,000 in student loan debt, it would be the same as putting $1,000 into a retirement plan, as far as matching goes. If a company matches by 6%, that's an extra $60 in savings.\n\n\"The earlier you do [invest], the more those investment gains can multiply,\" said T. Lake Moore V, an employee benefits attorney at McAfee & Taft.\n\nDelay mandatory withdrawals and limit tax penalties\n\nAmericans are retiring later and living longer. Secure 2.0 lifts the minimum age at which enrollees must begin withdrawing money from their accounts each year to 75 from 72. That allows for three additional years of tax-free growth on their retirement investments.\n\n(The penalty for those who fail to withdraw the required minimum from their account after 75 would be halved, to 25% from 50%.\n\nPart-time workers can contribute\n\nUnder the proposed act, companies that offer a 401(k) plan would be required to allow part-time employees who work at least 500 hours a year for two years, (the equivalent of just under 10 hours a week) to contribute to a retirement account. That would include part-time workers, gig employees, freelancers, caregivers and independent contractors.\n\nAdditional provisions", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/politics/white-house-correspondents-dinner/index.html", "title": "White House Correspondents' Dinner: Biden delivers remarks as ...", "text": "CNN will air special coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner from 7-11 p.m. ET anchored by John Berman and Brianna Keilar in Washington, DC.\n\n(CNN) President Joe Biden took a dig at his predecessor Saturday at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, while also joking about the press, the GOP and the continued existence of the event altogether.\n\n\"I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have,\" Biden said during his initial comments.\n\n\"We had a horrible plague followed by two years of Covid,\" he said. \"Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year, now that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.\"\n\nThe event marked Biden's first appearance at the widely attended Washington event since taking office.

Hide Caption 18 of 18\n\nCovid anxieties\n\nInside the gala, negative Covid-19 tests were required for entry and masks were voluntary -- just as they are throughout most of Washington.\n\nBut there had been growing concerns that Saturday night's event could lead to Covid cases among partygoers, after dozens of attendees -- including some of Biden's Cabinet officials -- who attended a different Washington party, the Gridiron Dinner, tested positive weeks ago.\n\nCases of Covid in Washington are now steady after rising following the decline of the Omicron variant's wave, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, the President's chief medical adviser, decided to bow out of Saturday's dinner after a personal risk assessment.\n\n\"In general, the risk is low, but I made a personal assessment. I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk,\" Fauci said earlier this week.\n\nSaturday's event also came after two top Biden officials recently tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris tested positive on Tuesday and remains asymptomatic. And the White House's top communications official, Kate Bedingfield, tested positive on Friday and is experiencing mild symptoms. The President was not considered a close contact in either case.\n\nBut Biden's decision to still attend the dinner, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this week, was \"a risk assessment and a decision he made on a personal basis.\" And Biden was intent on going, she said, to express his support for a free press. First lady Jill Biden also attended.\n\nThe White House said before the event that the President would be taking extra precautions to prevent catching Covid-19, including skipping the meal portion of the program. Biden sat on the dais, away from the crowded dining room, and wasn't expected to attend receptions before or afterward.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden also poked fun at Fox News and made note of the Covid-related requirements to attend the event.\n\n\"If you're at home watching this and you're wondering how to do that, just contact your favorite Fox News reporter. They're all here. Vaccinated and boosted. All of them,\" he said to resounding applause.\n\nAdjusting the tone for Biden's comedic set\n\nThe President had a rare chance for his comedic chops to shine Saturday night during remarks at the dinner, but the opportunity arguably came at a tough moment for the country to have a laugh.\n\nThe economic recovery from Covid-19 has stumbled in the first quarter of 2022 , with numbers revealing this week that gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 1.4% during the first three months of the year -- marking the worst quarter for the American economy since the spring of 2020. Russia is continuing to wage war with Ukraine. And as his party heads into a highly consequential midterms season, Biden's approval rating has stagnated -- with a recent CNN Poll of Polls average on Biden's handling of the presidency finding that 41% of Americans approve of the job he's doing, with 54% disapproving.\n\nBiden on Saturday acknowledged the difficulty he's had in getting his agenda across, while also touching on his grand promises of being able to reach across the aisle, saying, \"I came to office with an ambitious agenda, and I expected it to face stiff opposition in the Senate. I just hoped it would be from Republicans.\"\n\nThe speech also took place at a time when the American political environment remains extremely polarized, arguably more divided than in 2016 -- the last time a president delivered a speech at the dinner.\n\nWhile more partisan gridlock is possible, Biden said he was confident he could sort it out in a second term.\n\n\"We may end up with more partisan gridlock,\" he said. \"But I'm confident we can work it out during my remaining six years in the presidency.\"\n\nOn Republicans' use of the phrase \"Let's go Brandon\" against Biden, he said, \"Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year, and I'm kind of happy for him.\"\n\nBiden's speech had been in the works for a few weeks, officials said, and wasn't finished as of Friday. But at the outset of the writing process , the President told his team he envisioned an address that went beyond just an amalgamation of one-liners, wisecracks and gags.\n\nThe White House sourced a long list jokes from across his staff to craft Saturday night's set. Officials said the chief of staff Ron Klain, members of the communications team and others inside the White House sent jokes to Biden's speechwriters for consideration. Rob Flaherty, the director of digital strategy, and Dan Cluchey, a senior speechwriter -- both said to be among Biden's funniest staffers -- sent material.\n\nBiden was expected to do a few practice runs to get a feel for the delivery and timing, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden used the appearance to loudly affirm his belief in a free press after his predecessor -- who skipped the yearly dinner throughout his time in office -- labeled reporters the \"enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"At home, poison is running through our democracy,\" he said, but \"What's clear ... You, the free press, matter more than you ever did in the last century.\"\n\nAs he yielded the mic to Noah, Biden said to him, \"Now you get to roast the President of the United States. And unlike in Moscow, you won't go to jail.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Saturday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez", "Sarah Fortinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/politics/joe-biden-messaging-struggles/index.html", "title": "Beneath Biden's struggle to break through is a deeper dysfunction ...", "text": "(CNN) Being familiar never makes the feeling less dreadful: White House aides emailing each other during one of President Joe Biden's stops on the road, tracking who's covering what he's saying, which TV channels are taking the speech live -- and realizing a number of times that the answer was none.\n\n\"You are thinking,\" said one person familiar, \"why are we doing this?\"\n\nBiden and his inner circle get weekly readouts of the metrics on local newspaper coverage of his speeches, how long and for what he was covered on cable, but also videos that staff post on Twitter and other social media interactions. Those reports go on the piles with internal memos from pollsters saying Biden isn't breaking through in traditional news outlets and that the people who are engaged are mostly voters who've already made up their minds.\n\nBut beneath this struggle to break through is a deeper dysfunction calcified among aides who largely started working together only through Zoom screens and still struggle to get in rhythm. They're still finding it hard to grasp how much their political standing has changed over the last year, and there's a divide between most of the White House staff and the inner circle who have been around Biden for longer than most of the rest of that staff has been alive. In an email to CNN, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said, \"That is not the dynamic in the White House.\"\n\nAt the center is a president still trying to calibrate himself to the office. The country is pulling itself apart, pandemic infections keep coming, inflation keeps rising, a new crisis on top of new crisis arrives daily and Biden can't see a way to address that while also being the looser, happier, more sympathetic, lovingly Onion-parody inspiring, aviator-wearing, vanilla chip cone-licking guy -- an image that was the core of why he got elected in the first place.\n\n\"He has to speak to very serious things,\" explained one White House aide, \"and you can't do that getting ice cream.\"\n\nAides regularly talk about how little traction they're getting from one-off Biden appearances or events and then -- whether on inflation, the baby formula shortage or mass shootings or the other crises landing on Biden's desk -- he's often left looking like he's in a reactive crouch on the issues that matter most to voters rather than setting the agenda. Sometimes clipped moments from those speeches that the White House puts out on social media generate huge traffic but, at least as often, moments from the President appearing to be caught off-guard go viral on their own.\n\nAides and allies worry that the West Wing is making the same mistakes as they tout the White House's big pivot to inflation -- which they know is a defining issue for the midterms -- using all the methods Biden and his top advisers keep going back to: A Wall Street Journal op-ed, a basic photo-op Oval Office meeting with the Federal Reserve chairman and Treasury secretary, dispatching Cabinet secretaries for short TV interviews.\n\nBiden's speech on Thursday night calling for real action on new gun control laws was a departure from many of his recent appearances, complete with a carefully stage managed line up of mournful candles in glass lining his walkway into the East Room.\n\nBut even with his intense delivery and repeated return to the word \"Enough\" and laying out of an aspirational agenda that has little chance in Congress, despite broad support among many Americans outside of Washington, he was more than anything reacting to how the conversation had already taken shape without him. And then, less than an hour after he was done issuing his call to action, Biden left for an early weekend at his beach house in Delaware, without much of a public schedule for days.\n\nThe President is a 79-year-old man who still thinks in terms of newspaper front pages and primetime TV programs, surrounded by not-quite-as-senior aides in senior positions with the same late 1990s media diet. Lifelong habits don't tend to fade when people get to their desks in the West Wing.\n\n\"These numbers that get put up by 'soft media,'\" a senior adviser put it to others on staff recently, using a term meant to brush off all platforms that aren't older than Biden's grandkids, \"don't feel as real.\"\n\nIt's not just the kind of news Biden consumes, according to CNN's conversations with 14 White House aides and other Democrats in close touch with the White House. After 50 years of looking up to the Oval Office, televised speeches and front-page stories are how he thinks of a president making news, still conceiving of the presidency as a sort of Rooseveltian ideal where he can lay what's happening for an audience gathered around to hear from a commander-in-chief whose schedule keeps getting cleared for him to write, edit and review each set of remarks.\n\n\"A speech is presidential, remarks are presidential. His view is if he can just explain to people what's going on and why, that people will understand,\" said one person familiar with Biden's thinking.\n\nFinger-pointing inside the White House\n\nBiden aides cite a range of other factors -- a political press corps still hooked on Trump-style melodrama, a news environment dominated by Ukraine and pandemic, a Secret Service buffer that limits what Biden can do, lingering anxiety that he'll catch Covid-19 and possibly become really sick.\n\nThat's in between pointing fingers at each other for whose fault it is. They have the same internal meetings over and over, insisting that they need to change up their whole approach to how they're using Biden -- and then each time watch as nothing changes.\n\nOlder aides dismiss the younger aides as being too caught up in the tweet-by-tweet thinking they say lost the 2020 election for everyone else. Younger aides give up -- what's the point of working up innovative ideas, they ask themselves, if the ideas constantly get knocked down and the aides get looked down on for suggesting them?\n\nResponding to a question about the President's older media habits, Bates noted the weekly time set aside on the President's schedule for creating digital content and the over 70 people on staff who help create it and manage his various accounts, as well as two interviews in the past few months with online-only creators.\n\n\"The President has a well-rounded strategy that combines putting unprecedented resources into digital engagement, speeches that provide many of his most powerful moments, and person-to-person interactions that showcase important qualities like his empathy,\" Bates said.\n\nBiden did more traveling around the country during May than in any month of his presidency so far. But nearly every stop was the same toe-touch, take-a-factory-tour-then-give-a-speech-then-back-on-Air Force One routine, one-off events with a couple of mournful condolence trips to Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, added.\n\nNothing happened that wasn't on script. Nothing that's not fully planned.\n\nWhen they're on message, aides will take solace in driving local news coverage, despite the events not registering outside of whatever media market he lands in. When they're being frank, they acknowledge that they've been slow to realize that doing single events on any topic never seems to make much of an impact.\n\nSpeeches that have broken through -- like the President's sorrow-filled statement delivered while the bodies were still being identified in Uvalde -- are rarely because of either the words themselves or the delivery.\n\nIt's because Biden himself shines through, like when he, a father who's buried two of his own children, talked about the parents in Texas having parts of their souls ripped away, or on his condolence visit a few days later when he placed his hand on each murdered student's oversized photo.\n\nAides still figuring out the best way to present the President\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden tells CNN's Kaitlan Collins he didn't know until April the baby formula shortage would be so serious Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden tells CNN's Kaitlan Collins he didn't know until April the baby formula shortage would be so serious 03:29\n\nOutside of those consoler-in-chief moments, Biden and aides know they're not doing much to make him empathetic.\n\nHe'll talk about how he feels families' struggles over inflation and gas prices . He'll talk about how he knows about difficulties of the pandemic and the baby formula shortage. And then aides will talk about how he talked about it.\n\nThey'll tell each other he doesn't have enough time in his schedule. Then they'll say, actually, no, he is doing the kind of events that should resonate, just no one is giving him credit.\n\nThey'll note that the structure of the White House staff -- down to the physical arrangement of the offices, so that the press aides are all clustered together in the only accessible part of the West Wing -- is around interactions with traditional media outlets, even as viewership and readership declines.\n\nThey'll say he's answering reporters' questions whenever he's asked, while nixing interview requests to avoid the hours of prep and possible clean-up. They'll acknowledge that Biden himself feels shut off enough that he's quietly had a half-dozen sessions with favored writers since the fall, like last month's lunch with the New York Times' Tom Friedman, in which the columnist shared his own impressions of Biden's off-the-record thoughts, with only the tuna sandwich, fruit bowl and milkshake approved for publication.\n\nIn a January memo, White House chief of staff Ron Klain offered a compromise plan, to have Biden do one town hall each month to at least grab some unscripted moments and media exposure. That got sucked into the maw of blaming and dysfunction like so much else: Some aides embraced the idea for at least shaking things up a little, some mocked it for being an outdated idea, some complained that the logistics of making that happen would be impossibly time consuming.\n\nIn the end, not a single town hall was scheduled. A White House aide said Wednesday that now more town halls are expected in the near future.\n\nConducting the presidency 'from the set of Jeopardy'\n\nJUST WATCHED Biden administration 'optimistic' inflation will ease over the coming months, top economic official says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden administration 'optimistic' inflation will ease over the coming months, top economic official says 03:28\n\nThe most effective way Biden aides found to convince people the President isn't the doddering right-wing media caricature is when people see him in action, they'll say in meetings and emails and memos. And the best way to convince voters that he's taking action on a list of complaints, which is growing longer almost by the week, is to show him actually doing things.\n\nThose little moments which have always been his magic, the retail politics virtuosity of finding the humanity in almost anyone he talks to and having them find the humanity in him -- that's what they need more of, they say. And anyway, that's what makes him the happiest.\n\nYet Biden keeps showing up behind the same podiums surrounded by the same big screens, talking from a remove about what he feels and what he wants to do about it. He's coming across disconnected, aides have acknowledged to allies in Congress and beyond. And then, they say, the same events keep getting planned.\n\n\"World's most interactive man,\" sighed one person familiar with White House operations after one of the recent events, \"and we're going to have him conduct the presidency from the set of Jeopardy.\"\n\nExcited as White House aides were by the appearance by the K-pop superstars BTS showing up at the daily press briefing on Tuesday, with more than 180,000 people watching the live stream at one point and fans pressed up against the security gates asking what the singers smelled like, they also acknowledged the downside some wish would be more instructive: That brief BTS visit will likely be seen more than anything Biden will do for weeks.\n\n'He has so much more to offer'\n\nWhat they agree on in the White House -- at least recently -- is that Biden's chances of breaking through go up massively the more he picks fights with Republicans.\n\nThey also agree that they're being held back by the President's own reluctance to hit harder, steeped in both his attempt to push America back to what he insists can't be a bygone era of cooperation and his sense that a president shouldn't get petty.\n\nWhen he said at the beginning of May that he \"never anticipated\" that the Trump-style politics would dominate the Republican Party, he was mocked for seeming clueless about a political atmosphere that he spent his whole campaign calling \"a battle for the soul of America.\"\n\nWhen he said over Memorial Day weekend that he counted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas Sen. John Cornyn as \"rational Republicans\" whom he could get an agreement with on new gun laws, the forehead smacks among staff and other involved Democrats echoed around the Tidal Basin.\n\nOn assault weapons and other priorities, that \"do something!\" anger is bubbling throughout Biden's base, but what voters are getting back instead is what the President would call a frank assessment that there's not much he actually can do.\n\nAides are facing their own constraints, and not just from the national security officials who've assessed that Biden can't go on TikTok because of security concerns around the Chinese government's stake in the company.\n\nLawyers in the White House Counsel's Office, continually on edge over potential violations of the Hatch Act prohibitions around mixing politics and government, needed to review Biden's new \"ultra MAGA\" line in order for government-salaried aides to be allowed to repeat it, since having them talk about Donald Trump by name was deemed too political. \"Congressional Republicans\" was allowed for official statements because the term refers to a specific target, but using \"Republicans\" generally was also deemed too political.\n\nMany in the West Wing are counting on the recent return of Anita Dunn, who helped both manage Biden and bring a directed sense of mission to the staff during an often otherwise haphazard presidential campaign. She'll be able to shake the President from patterns that have become ingrained, they believe, and to get everyone else organized ahead of the midterms around a clearer, more connected sense of mission.\n\nA White House aide cited stats to show just how much aides have been able to do with Biden's online presence when they can get everyone on the same page. The video Biden shot in the Oval Office with BTS to talk about anti-Asian hate crimes racked up over 50 million views in the first 24 hours, the President's mental health chat with actress Selena Gomez passed 5 million, Jimmy Fallon at the Easter Egg Roll passed 4 million. Pop star Olivia Rodrigo's video with Biden on vaccines is at over 100 million views, but even a less snazzy YouTube town hall on vaccines is over 2 million views.\n\nThe irony, according to a number of top Democrats, is that with the country still battered and shaken from politics, the pandemic, the wobbly economy and just about everything else from the last few years, Joe Biden's persona has all the pieces to meet the moment -- if he came out to meet it.\n\nHe's the empathetic guy. He's the middle-class guy. He's the come together and work it out guy.\n\nSo, while some Democrats in tight races have started distancing themselves from Biden, others have kept asking aides to get more -- so long as he doesn't bring his podium along for the trip.\n\nRep. Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota working to hold onto his seat in the fall, said that he's struck by how much of a difference there was between the distant Biden whom he knows his constituents are seeing every day and the engaged President he talked with on Air Force One at the end of April, flying to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to attend the memorial service for Walter Mondale.\n\n\"I wish every American could have been with us because he was so engaging, empathetic, resolute, and kind. Those are his superpowers,\" Phillips said.\n\n\"It astounds and disappoints me that the magic of the tools of that office are being so under-utilized. He's the grandfather of the country at a time we need one more than ever. He should be giving fireside chats, speaking to -- and hearing from -- Americans directly about their concerns and anxieties. He has so much more to offer America than he has been able to share, and I still hope the country gets to see and feel what I did during that hour with him.\"", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html", "title": "The highly contagious Omicron variant will 'find just about everybody ...", "text": "(CNN) As the Omicron variant spreads like wildfire across the United States , it's likely just about everybody will be exposed to the strain, but vaccinated people will still fare better, the nation's leading infectious disease expert said Tuesday.\n\n\"Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci told J.

Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n\"I think it's hard to process what's actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,\" Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. \"And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday -- a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That's about three times last winter's peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week -- 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky.\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues -- not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n\"Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,\" said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n\"If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,\" he said, and Kentucky is \"down to 134 adult ICU beds available.\"\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to \"commit every resource available to beating back the wave\" caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals \"over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,\" he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n\"It's time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That's how we'll get through this surge without endangering more lives,\" Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 -- but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 \"are coming in not because they're sick with Covid, but because they're coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n\"If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol -- personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it's a huge drain on the system overall,\" Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday , included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n\"This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,\" executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of \"ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.\" Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19. In Detroit, 20-25% of SMART bus service is canceled or delayed, the agency said in a statement Saturday.", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell", "Jason Hanna", "Deidre Mcphillips", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/03/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html", "title": "More than 100,000 people hospitalized with Covid-19 for first time in ...", "text": "(CNN) More than 103,000 people are currently hospitalized with Covid-19, the first time the total has reached six figures in nearly four months, according to the latest data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations reached a record high of more than 142,000 about a year ago, on January 14, 2021, and last topped 100,000 on September 11. The total fell to about 45,000 hospitalizations in early November, but increased steadily since then, and surged in the last week. Just last Monday, HHS reported 71,000 Covid-19 hospitalizations.\n\nStates also are reporting surges in the number of children hospitalized. In Illinois, that number has almost tripled since the beginning of December, Gov. J. B. Pritzker said Monday. New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the total number of pediatric hospitalizations in that state has almost doubled in seven days.\n\nData published from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services last week showed that pediatric hospital admissions had reached a record high\n\nThe hospitalizations are primarily among unvaccinated people. According to the latest CDC data, cumulative hospitalization rates through November are about eight times higher for unvaccinated adults and about 10 times higher for unvaccinated children ages 12 to 17.\n\nThe rise in hospitalizations comes amid a much larger surge in Covid-19 cases spurred by the Omicron variant. Although early studies have suggested Omicron causes milder illness, the variant has spread so quickly and widely, hospitals are still facing challenges providing proper care.\n\n\"This narrative that it's just a mild virus is not accurate,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said Monday.\n\n\"We've just done a terrible job vaccinating our kids across the country... So even though there's a lot of happy talk about the Omicron variant, less severe disease, when you add up all the factors... we've got a very serious situation facing us in this country, especially for the kids.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that with so many cases, \"even if the rate of hospitalization is lower with Omicron than it is with Delta, there's still the danger that you're going to have a surging of hospitalizations that might stress the health care system.\"\n\nDr. James Phillips, chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Hospital, said that has come to pass.\n\n\"We're seeing a surge in patients again, unprecedented in this pandemic,\" he said. \"What's coming for the rest of the country could be very serious. And they need to be prepared.\"\n\nReturn of school adds new worries\n\nThe resumption of school on Monday after the holiday break has also led to concerns about further spread.\n\nIn Atlanta, at least five metro-area school districts will begin with remote learning this week, as students prepare to return from the holiday break amid rising cases in the region. In Washington, DC, public schools will be closed until Thursday as a winter storm thwarted plans for students and staff to pick up Covid-19 tests.\n\nOther school officials are also changing their Covid-19 policies due to the explosion of the Omicron variant. The New Orleans school district added the Covid-19 vaccine to its list of required immunizations for all students 5 and older, effective February 1.\n\nMiami-Dade County Public Schools is requiring all adults entering its buildings and buses to wear masks upon return and has strongly encouraged students to wear masks as well. Public schools in Detroit are closed Monday through Wednesday as the city faces an all-time high Covid-19 infection rate.\n\nLos Angeles Unified students will be required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test before returning to school after the winter break, the district told parents in an email Monday. The district also pushed back the return by a day.\n\nDr. Stanley Spinner, chief medical officer at Texas Children's Pediatrics, told CNN's Pamela Brown, \"When our largest school system gets back, I think we are going to see our numbers increasing even more unfortunately as a result of that.\"\n\nWhile there may be \"bumps in the road\" as schools attempt to reopen in the new year amid a record surge in Covid-19 cases, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said students have suffered enough and need to be back in class.\n\n\"Our expectation is for schools to be open full-time for students for in person learning,\" Cardona said on Fox News on Sunday, noting the science has improved nearly two years into the pandemic and vaccines are available for school-aged children. \"There's a level of urgency that we shouldn't lose around making sure that our children learn in person.\"\n\nMany students are now eligible for booster shots. The US Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for booster shots in 12- to 15-year-olds on Monday. About half of the 12 to 15 population is fully vaccinated.\n\nDespite the push to keep schools open, some teachers have instead pushed to move to remote learning until this wave subsides. In Massachusetts, teachers called for state officials to close schools during the worst of the surge, but were rebuffed by the education commissioner and Gov. Charlie Baker.\n\n\"There are a lot of tools and capabilities available to keep kids and adults safe in school, and we should do everything in our power to make sure that kids stay in school,\" Baker said, while also highlighting the state's test and stay program.\n\nThe picture was similar in New York City, where new mayor Eric Adams felt schools must remain open and rejected a request from the teachers union to begin the month with remote learning until the current wave of the virus subsides.\n\nGetting children back to school is a \"precious thing,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.\n\n\"And because it's a precious thing, we need to treat it preciously, meaning arm those children with the two things we have that can protect them,\" which are masking and vaccination, Offit told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.\n\nHospitalizations rise as health care services are stretched thin\n\nHealth care workers have been exhausted by several surges since the pandemic began, and now many are getting sidelined during the rapid rise of the Omicron variant -- the most contagious strain to hit the US.\n\n\"Our health system is at a very different place than we were in previous surges,\" emergency medicine professor Dr. Esther Choo said.\n\n\"This strain is so infectious that I think all of us know many, many colleagues who are currently infected or have symptoms and are under quarantine,\" said Choo. \"We've lost at least 20% of our health care workforce; probably more.\"\n\nThe University of Maryland Capital Region Health this week joined a growing list of medical centers in the state to activate emergency protocols after a sharp rise in cases fueled staffing shortages and overwhelmed emergency departments.\n\n\"The current demand for care is depleting our available resources, including staffing,\" UM Capital Region Health said in a statement Friday.\n\nThere is also concern that while Omicron may be a milder form of coronavirus for adults, it could pose a greater risk to children, according to Dr. Scott Gottlieb.\n\n\"It appears to be more of an upper airway disease than a lower airway disease. That's good for most Americans. The one group that that may be a problem for is very young children -- toddlers -- who have trouble with upper airway infections,\" Gottlieb told Margaret Brennan on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\n\n\"You're in fact seeing more croup-like infections and bronchiolitis in New York City among children. So that could be a challenge for young kids, and we are seeing rising hospitalizations among that pediatric segment,\" said Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration and a current board member at Pfizer.\n\nAt Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, health care workers are seeing \"more Covid now than we have seen in previous waves,\" Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at the center, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday.\n\n\"This is not the time to minimize Covid-19 as an illness in children.,\" Bracho-Sanchez said. \"This is now the time to take every tool we have and use it to protect those kids like your son, like my son, who cannot get vaccinated yet.\"", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips", "Derrick Hinds"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/tennis/australian-open-mens-final-nadal-medvedev-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Australian Open: Nadal beats Medvedev in epic final | CNN", "text": "(CNN) Rafael Nadal clinched a record-breaking 21st grand slam title after beating Daniil Medvedev 2-6 6-7 6-4 6-4 7-5 in an Australian Open final for the ages.\n\nThe Spaniard surpassed the previous men's record of 20 he held jointly with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, the latter of whom was denied entry into the country after having his visa revoked.\n\nThere had been major doubts about whether or not Nadal would even be fit enough to play at the Australian Open after missing the second half of 2021 with a foot injury.\n\nHowever, he returned to action at the Melbourne Summer Set tournament at the beginning of January, going on to win his first ATP title since May 2021.\n\nAfter beating Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open semifinal, Nadal said he was just happy to be back on the court after being beset by injuries.\n\nAs he sank to the floor, exhausted but victorious after five-and-a-half enthralling hours, Nadal proved he was not only fit enough to still compete at grand slams, but could realistically still win several more.\n\n\"It has been one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career and to share the court with you [Medvedev] was an honor,\" Nadal said in his on court interview. \"I don't even know what to say, guys, for me it's just amazing.\n\nRafael Nadal sinks to his knees after winning the Australian Open.\n\n\"I can't thank enough all the guys that are there [in my box], all the team, family ... just how hard the last year and half has been and in the low moments you have been there to support me and without you guys none of this would be possible.\n\n\"Being honest, one and a half months ago I didn't know if I would be back on the tour playing tennis again and today I am here in front of you with the trophy again,\" he said after Sunday's final. \"You don't know how much I fought to be here. Thank you so much for the love and support.\n\n\"Without a doubt [it was] one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career and having the huge support I received during the three weeks is going to stay in my heart for the rest of my life, so many, many thanks.\n\n\"One month and half ago I would have said it would be my last Australian Open, but now I have a lot of energy to carry on. I cant explain the feelings I have now, but I'm going to try my best to come back next year.\"\n\nRafael Nadal celebrates victory in the men's singles final of the Australian Open.\n\nMedvedev cruises early\n\nThe crowd was audibly in favor of Nadal when the two players walked out onto the court, with a smattering of boos echoing around Rod Laver arena when Medvedev was introduced.\n\nIn Nadal's second service game, the pair exchanged a grueling 26-shot rally which ended with Medvedev's pinpoint backhand down the line to open up a 0-30 advantage.\n\nThe Spaniard then shut the door with two quite remarkable points; the first a ridiculous passing shot after Medvedev had crushed a short forehand straight at him, the second a volley winner after being forced to go full stretch to reach a huge forehand.\n\nNadal did eventually hold serve to take an early 2-1 lead, but he was being made to work brutally hard for every single point and was already being forced to produce some of his best tennis.\n\nAs Medvedev cruised through his own service games by comparison, heaping the pressure immediately back onto Nadal, you had to wonder whether this level of tennis was sustainable for five sets for the 35-year-old.\n\nThe pair had barely been playing for 20 minutes and already Nadal was drenched with sweat, his shirt clinging to his torso and beads falling from head. At the other end of the court, Medvedev looked like he'd barely broken a sweat.\n\nIndeed, Nadal's serve was broken to love in his very next service game as Medvedev took a 3-2 lead. Things were looking ominous.\n\nTwo more easy holds followed, as did another easy break of Nadal's serve, as Medvedev closed out the first set without dropping another game.\n\nDaniil Medvedev comfortably took the first set against Nadal.\n\nNadal fights back\n\nNadal desperately needed to try something different in the second set; Medvedev was hitting the ball harder and more cleanly and felt like the favorite to win each point at the start of every rally.\n\nThe Spaniard opened the second set with a relatively comfortable hold of serve -- perhaps his only one of the match so far -- celebrating with a shout of \"si\" and a fist pump towards his box as he attempted to fire himself up.\n\nIt clearly worked as Nadal earned his first break of the match in Medevedev's next service game -- and he was really made to earn it.\n\nNadal ended a mammoth 40-shot rally with a quite ridiculous sliced backhand that Medvedev couldn't get anywhere near to open up a 15-40 lead, eventually breaking serve with his second break point to go 3-1 up.\n\nHowever, after an easy hold of serve, Medvedev held his own serve before breaking Nadal back -- much to the despair of the boisterous crowd on Rod Laver.\n\nThis match, though, was becoming unpredictable and Nadal broke Medvedev's serve once again to take a 5-3 lead and give himself the chance to serve for the second set.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, an incident in the stands forced a number of security guards to come onto the court and stand around the two players as a man apparently attempted to jump onto the court.\n\nRafael Nadal rallied in the second set.\n\nIn keeping with the rest of the match, it was a brutal game that lasted more than 12 minutes and it was Medvedev that came out on top, finally breaking back with his fifth break point to make it 4-5 and deny Nadal the set.\n\nThe pair exchanged holds of serve until the set reached a tie break. Nadal had done well to make this match a contest, but winning this set was felt crucial to ensuring the final would go the distance.\n\nThe Spaniard has produced some Herculean efforts throughout his career, but coming from two sets down here was surely beyond him. Wasn't it?\n\nAs the clock ticked over the two hour mark, both players continued to produce outstanding tennis but it was once again Medvedev who got the better of Nadal.\n\nOne crucial point in the tie breaker -- with Nadal leading 5-4 -- went to the Russian as Nadal's volley dropped just wide. The hawkeye system confirmed the line judge's call, but the decision was still roundly booed by the crowd.\n\nAfter Medvedev hit the backhand winner that earned him the tie break and deflated the crowd, he turned to look at the stands and raised his arms above his head as a mixture of cheers and jeers rained down.\n\nDaniil Medvedev was cheered and jeered after winning the second set.\n\nDown, but never out\n\nDespite the bitter disappointment, Nadal began the second set strongly and had a wonderful chance to give himself two early break point, but a less than perfect approach shot allowed Medvedev to hit a huge backhand winner that flashed past his opponent at the net.\n\nNadal glanced up at his box with a worried look on his face, knowing how costly these squandered opportunities would be.\n\nThe set -- and the match -- soon looked like it was over with Nadal 0-40 down while serving at 2-3.\n\nBut the Mallorcan has forged a reputation as one of the biggest warriors on the court and, even now in twilight of his career, there are no signs of that fight fading.\n\nNadal clawed his way back to deuce, before eventually winning the game to level the third set.\n\nThe momentum of this final swung dramatically with Medvedev serving at 4-4, as nerves seemed to be getting the better of the Russian as he approached the finish line.\n\nOne bizarre attempt at a drop shot resulted in the ball hitting the net and Medvedev sarcastically applauded the crowd, who he felt had made noise before he hit the shot, leading to a loud chorus of boos.\n\nRafael Nadal takes in the crowd after hitting a winner.\n\nNadal broke his opponent with an incredible backhand passing shot down the line and the Rod Laver arena erupted -- it was by some distance the loudest sound of the night.\n\nUnlike in the second set, Nadal held serve with ease thanks to four straight winners to make it 2-1 and Medvedev appeared to be rattled.\n\nDuring the changeover, he told the umpire that some fans were \"idiots with empty brains\" after one supporter had shouted just before Nadal was going to serve.\n\nThe comeback is on\n\nThe momentum continued to swing further in Nadal's favor at the start of the fourth set, as the Spaniard somehow managed to save two break points to make it 1-1.\n\nMedvedev had certainly allowed to let the fans get inside his head, as a double fault to hand Nadal a break of serve ended with him sarcastically applauding and putting his thumb up to the crowd.\n\nThe Russian calmed himself down during the change of ends and responded with an immediate break back, leading the area to burst into a chorus of \"let's go, Rafa, let's go.\"\n\nHowever, he just couldn't stop a resurgent Nadal.\n\nMedvedev managed to take his next service game to deuce after being 0-40 down, but Nadal was relentless in his pursuit of another break of serve and eventually got it at the seventh time of asking to end another marathon game.\n\nNadal was now playing some of the best tennis of his life -- and it had to be that good to beat his opponent -- holding his next service game to take a 4-2 lead in the fourth.\n\nMedvedev had also called the trainer to massage his right thigh and at times he appeared to be in a little discomfort when moving that leg.\n\nDaniil Medvedev looked to be struggling at the back of the court.\n\nNadal's next service game was the biggest of the set, as he rattled off four straight points from 15-40 down to make it 5-3.\n\nMedvedev managed to hold the next game, fending off a set point, but it was just delaying the inevitable as Nadal closed it out with a faultless service game. This match was quickly turning into one of the all-time great grand slam finals.\n\nRafa returns\n\nMedvedev had to dig deep again at the beginning of the fifth set, saving another early break point. It was the 12th break point he'd saved in the match, a new record for the Russian.\n\nThere was seemingly now no stopping Nadal, as he broke his opponent's serve once again to take a 3-2 lead -- perhaps for the first time he would allow himself to start thinking about number 21.\n\nNadal ensured, for the time being, that Medvedev didn't get back into the set, saving multiple break points in a game that went to deuce six times to make it 4-2.\n\nThe match clock now showed these two show stoppers had been battling it out for five hours, yet neither player looked like dropping their level any time soon.\n\nNadal was soon serving at 5-4 to win the championship and had a 30-0 lead, seemingly on the cusp of creating history. However, Medvedev dug deeper still to win four straight points and break back at the most vital of moments.\n\nRafael Nadal lifts a historic 21st grand slam trophy.\n\nHowever, Nadal was just not going to be denied his record title. He broke back immediately, perhaps playing his best tennis of the final, and then had his second chance at serving for the championship.\n\nIt was a chance he wouldn't squander again, holding his nerve expertly to etch his name into the history books.\n\nGiven where he was just sixth months ago, at times pondering retirement, Nadal's victory here in Melbourne will go down as one of tennis' greatest wins.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/success/refund-filing-taxes-feseries/index.html", "title": "5 tax changes that can boost your refund this year | CNN Business", "text": "Many US tax filers get refunds when they file their federal income taxes. But this year, thanks to several temporarily expanded tax breaks, you could get back more -- or in some cases, less -- than you might expect.\n\nThis is particularly the case if you were eligible to receive any of the tax relief measures included in the American Rescue Plan , which was signed into law last March.\n\nIn many instances, the tax breaks will also benefit low-income earners who ordinarily do not have to file a return.\n\nHere are several key breaks you should keep in mind as you gather documents to prepare your 1040.\n\n1. More generous child and dependent care tax credit\n\nable to care for themselves, you likely will benefit from the temporary increases made to the If you were working or going to school and paying for the care of a child under 13 or another family member who is not mentally or physicallyable to care for themselves, you likely will benefit from the temporary increases made to the child and dependent care credit\n\n\"This is a biggie. It was significantly expanded,\" said Kathy Pickering, Chief Tax Officer, The Tax Institute at H&R Block.\n\nThe credit is based on your income and calculated as a percentage of the qualifying expenses you incurred -- which this year is 50%, up from 35% in the years prior, although that percentage is reduced for those making more than $125,000.\n\nQualifying expenses are minus any employer-provided dependent care benefits (e.g., money you put into a tax-advantaged flexible spending account).\n\nrespectively. All in, the credit this year could reduce your tax bill -- or increase your refund -- by up to $4,000 for one dependent or $8,000 for two or more. Prior to 2021, the credit would only have done so by $1,050 or $2,100,respectively.\n\n2. A temporary expansion of the child tax credit\n\nThe maximum value of the child tax credit is temporarily $3,000 per child ages 6 through 17 and $3,600 per child ages 5 and under.\n\nUnlike in prior years, the credit is fully refundable for 2021, meaning you can get the maximum amount of the credit even if it exceeds your federal income tax liability for the year.\n\nExcept for the wealthiest households, \"anyone with children ages 17 and below is likely eligible to claim the child tax credit,\" Pickering said.\n\ndetailing the amount you've already received, which you should use to reconcile how much more you are due. The amount may be different than you expect. And for the first time, the IRS made advanced monthly payments on that credit, from July through December . So you may already have received about half of your credit and can claim the other half on your return. To help with that calculation, the IRS will send you a letter (Letter 6419) detailing the amount you've already received, which you should use to reconcile how much more you are due. The amount may be different than you expect.\n\nHere's why: The advanced payments were calculated based on your 2020 or 2019 income and family situation. But the final calculation will be based on your 2021 information, which may change how much you're eligible for.\n\nFor instance, if you had another child in 2021 you may be entitled to more than your advanced payments reflect.\n\nOr you may have gotten paid too much if, for example, you're divorced and changed which parent could claim a child on their tax return. The same might be true if you made more money in 2021 or one of your children turned 18. Whether you have to \"repay\" the excess you got -- which most likely means you just claim less of a credit for the first half of last year -- depends on your income.\n\nyou may have to repay. (Here is the Those making less than $40,000 ($60,000 if married) get full repayment protection. But if you're making more than $80,000 (or $120,000 if married)you may have to repay. (Here is the IRS's FAQ on the issue.)\n\n3. Claim a recovery rebate credit\n\nSince the pandemic began, the IRS has sent out three rounds of Economic Impact Payments to eligible Americans, the last of which went out in 2021.\n\nIf you got that third payment, the IRS will send you a letter (Letter 6475) detailing how much you were paid. You should report that information on your return.\n\nBut if you didn't get the third payment -- or perhaps now qualify for more than you were paid because your income or family situation changed -- you should review whether to claim the refundable recovery rebate credit\n\n\"Individuals who didn't qualify for a third Economic Impact Payment or got less than the full amount, may be eligible to claim the 2021 recovery rebate credit based on their 2021 tax year information,\" the IRS noted.\n\nIf you got a stimulus payment but your 2021 income would have disqualified you, there's good news. \"You do not need to repay the third stimulus payment -- which was based on your 2019 or 2020 income -- if your 2021 income would have disqualified you from all or part of the payment,\" said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.\n\n4. Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit\n\nThe American Rescue Plan nearly tripled the maximum credit available to $1,502.\n\nTo qualify, your earned income for 2021 must be below $21,430 ($27,380 if married filing jointly). And on a permanent basis for all EITC recipients, the amount of investment income you may have on top of your wages and still claim the credit increased to $10,000.\n\nThe credit is also available for the first time to childless workers as young as 19 and workers 65 and older.\n\nFor people who do have qualifying children, if they earn $57,414 or less, they may qualify for the EITC. And depending how many kids they have, they could get a maximum credit of $6,728.\n\n5. Special charitable tax deduction\n\nNormally, only tax filers who itemize deductions can deduct their charitable contributions. But the IRS once again is allowing those who take the standard deduction -- which is the majority of tax filers -- to deduct up to $300 in cash to qualifying charities. And this year, married couples filing jointly may deduct up to $600.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2022/04/18/stream-better-call-sauls-season-6/7356420001/", "title": "Stream 'Better Call Saul''s season six on AMC+ today", "text": "Liz Kocan\n\nReviewed\n\n— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Odenkirk originated the sleazy lawyer on Breaking Bad in 2009, in what he was told was going to be a brief, three-episode arc, but Goodman proved to be such a popular character that he remained on the series for the rest of its run. Almost immediately following Breaking Bad, Saul became the titular character in the AMC spinoff prequel Better Call Saul. If you’ve been following the show, you’re in luck: Better Call Saul season six premieres today, April 18—and we’ve got the details on how to stream it.\n\nThere’s a lot more where this came from. Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\n\nProduction this season has been fraught with off-screen drama, including delays due to COVID-19 and a brief production hiatus after Odenkirk suffered a heart attack last July, but Odenkirk has recovered and the show’s final season (which will reportedly feature Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul playing their Breaking Bad characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, though additional details on the season are scarce) has wrapped production. The show will be available to watch on cable on AMC, but cord-cutters don’t have to worry: There are ways to stream the final season of Better Call Saul.\n\n► Spring Deals: The best spring deals you can shop today\n\nWhere Can You Stream Better Call Saul?\n\nBetter Call Saul is also available to stream on AMC+, the streaming service that offers hundreds of episodes of acclaimed series featured on AMC, from the sly ‘60s drama Mad Men to the intense action of The Walking Dead. There are also titles exclusive to AMC+, from the period drama of The North Water to the animated mystery of Ultra City Smiths. All of that content is topped off with series produced by BBC America, Shudder and IFC Films Unlimited. Plans for AMC+ are available for $6.99 a month with a free 7-day trial period for first-time subscribers, and no cable subscription is necessary to subscribe.\n\nSeason six of Better Call Saul will also be available on Sling TV, the first app-based TV service that allows you to stream live television and on-demand content on the internet. Among Sling’s offerings are live TV, local TV channels, DVR storage and a catalog of On Demand programming, starting at $35 per month.\n\nBetter Call Saul season six will also be available on Netflix for UK subscribers starting Tuesday, April 19.

Part one premieres today, Monday, April 18, with two episodes released on the day of the premiere itself and the remaining five episodes released weekly. The show will air on AMC at 9 p.m. ET/PT. The second half of season six, consisting of six episodes, premieres on Monday, July 11. Over the last five seasons, we’ve seen the progression of Odenkirk’s character, who starts as a criminal defense lawyer named Jimmy McGill, as he slowly becomes more involved with the criminal world and as he grows into the role of a savvy con-man and assumes the name Saul Goodman (a play on the phrase “It’s all good, man”). In this final season, show creator Vinge Gilligan has confirmed that we will see Saul as he meets Breaking Bad’s Walter White and Jesse Pinkman (Cranston and Paul), narrowing the time-gap between the two shows.\n\nHow To Sign Up For AMC+ and Sling\n\nAMC+ is available as a standalone subscription through the channel’s website, or through your cable provider, starting at $6.99 a month.\n\nVerizon is also offering 12 months of AMC+ access for free to new and existing customers who purchase one of their 5G smartphones with a device payment plan on a Play More, Do More, or Get More Unlimited plan.

After the past 25 months, forgetting the pandemic for even a little while may sound like a fantasy -- after all, the coronavirus has gotten our hopes up before.\n\nBut infectious disease experts say there just may be an end in sight. Maybe.\n\nWell, let's say it's not outside the realm of possibility for 2022.\n\n\"I think if we do it right, we're going to have a 2022 in which Covid doesn't dominate our lives so much,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under President Obama and is now the CEO and president of Resolve to Save Lives.\n\nWhat the next part of the pandemic looks like and when it will get there are what Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Stanford Medicine, and experts at federal agencies, academic colleagues and local public health leaders spent the holidays trying to figure out.\n\nThere was a general consensus among the experts about what happens next: \"We really don't know exactly,\" Maldonado said.\n\nThere are disease models and lessons from pandemics past, but the way the highly infectious Omicron variant popped up meant the scientists' proverbial crystal ball got a little hazy.\n\n\"None of us really anticipated Omicron,\" Maldonado said. \"Well, there were hints, but we did not expect it to happen exactly the way it did.\"\n\nOmicron has done a lot. More than a quarter of the Covid-19 pandemic's total cases in the United States have been reported in the past month, during the Omicron surge, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAs of Thursday, cases dropped at least 10% compared with last week in 14 states, but 26 states saw cases rise at least 10%, according to Johns Hopkins data.\n\nThe wave seems to have peaked in some areas where the Omicron variant first hit in the US, like Boston and New York. But it's still raging out of control in other parts of the country.\n\nIn Georgia, for instance, medical leaders in metro Atlanta said hospitals remain overwhelmed. With so many staff out sick, the National Guard now fills in the health care gaps in states like Minnesota . Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the \"tremendous\" amount of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths has resulted in \"as much as we've ever had in the state of Louisiana.\"\n\nInfectious disease experts, however, see hope in what has happened in South Africa.\n\n\"South Africa's kind of our canary in the coal mine because they were able to pick up the Omicron variant first,\" Maldonado said.\n\nSouth African scientists first spotted the variant in November. Cases there peaked and fell off quickly. They did the same in the UK. And that's what experts think will happen everywhere.\n\n\"I anticipate in the short run -- being the next six weeks, four to six weeks -- that it's still going to be pretty rough,\" said Dr. John Swartzberg, an expert in infectious diseases and vaccinology and clinical professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health. \"It will be about the middle of February before we start to really see that things are getting better.\"\n\nIf this spike flames out quickly, many experts think, there could be a \"quiet period.\"\n\nSwartzberg believes March through spring or into summer will be like last year, with a continued decline in the number of cases. \"There will be a sense of optimism, and then we will be able to do more things in our lives,\" Swartzberg said. \"I think May or June is going to really look up for us. I'm quite optimistic.\"\n\nPart of his optimism stems from the fact that there will be a much larger immune population, between the increasing number of people who are vaccinated and boosted, and those who've caught Covid-19 during the Omicron surge.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the level of immunity in our population is going to be much higher than it was going into the Omicron pandemic, and that's going to help us not only with Omicron and Delta, if they're still circulating, but it will also help us with any new variants,\" Swartzberg said. \"To what degree will depend on the availability of medicines to intervene.\"\n\nThat's because the coronavirus will probably never go away completely.\n\n\"I fully anticipate another version of the virus to come back,\" Maldonado said. \"Those are the scenarios that really bring uncertainty to what comes next.\"\n\nHave you read these yet? More than 333,000 pacifiers recalled due to choking hazard Louie Anderson, comic and 'Baskets' star, dead at 68 Bitcoin tumbles as cryptocurrencies continue their downward slide Alex Murdaugh charged with 23 more crimes\n\nThe next variant\n\nThe next variant could be equally or even more transmissible than Omicron. It could give people more severe symptoms -- or no symptoms at all.\n\n\"It's not at all clear what comes next,\" said Dr. George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. He said the virus could mutate gradually, like what happened with the Alpha and Beta variants. Or it could make a really large jump, like with Delta and Omicron. \"What's next? It's a crapshoot.\"\n\nThe H1N1 flu virus, for example, was a novel virus when it started one of the worst pandemics in history in 1918 -- it infected one-third of the world's population and killed 50 million of them.\n\nThat pandemic eventually ended, but the virus is still with us today.\n\n\"That was the great-great-grandparent of all the H1N1 viruses we see every year,\" Maldonado said. \"They've had many mutations since then, but it is from the same strain. So it's possible that this virus will do a similar thing.\"\n\nThe US still loses an average of about 35,000 people a year with the flu, according to the CDC . \"And we go on with our lives,\" Swartzberg said. \"I don't think it will ever go back to what it was, exactly.\"\n\nMaldonado says \"that's the best-case scenario.\"\n\nWith this flu-like scenario, the world needs to focus on protecting those vulnerable to severe disease, on making sure they get vaccinated and have access to monoclonal antibodies and antivirals, Maldonado said. Vaccine companies would need to make variant-specific vaccines so people can get a Covid-19 shot every year. The country also has to make testing better.\n\n\"The oral drugs and the monoclonals are no good unless you know you're Covid-positive,\" Swartzberg said.\n\nThe in-between scenarios would be if there aren't enough antivirals or monoclonals to treat the people who get sick, or if vaccine manufacturers can't make variant-specific vaccines fast enough.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is if a variant escapes the protection of vaccines and treatments.\n\n\"I think that's less likely to happen,\" Maldonado said.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he hopes that scenario doesn't come to pass. \"I can't give you a statistic what the chance of that happen, but we have to be prepared for it.\n\n\"So we hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\"\n\n'Choose Your Own Adventure' out of the pandemic\n\nThe US already has the tools to limit new variants and end the pandemic quickly, Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos says.\n\n\"I don't think we need any more scientific breakthroughs, we know how to stop severe Covid: vaccines,\" said Galiatsatos, an assistant professor of medicine and expert in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nFace masks and testing also help.\n\nGaliatsatos does hundreds of talks each year with community groups to encourage more people to get vaccinated. He thinks scientist will have to continue this outreach.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"We have the weapons to transform Covid into nothing but a bad cold,\" Galiatsatos said. \"We have the science. All people will need is access to the interventions, and we need to regain trust.\"\n\nOnly about a quarter of the US population is fully vaccinated and boosted, according to the CDC. The more people who are unvaccinated, the more end up in the hospital. The more cases, the more opportunity for dangerous new variants.\n\n\"That's why it's like a 'Choose Your Own Adventure,' \" Galiatsatos said. \"And I am choosing the kind that puts us in a better frame of mind that we reach people and get more people vaccinated and can end this pandemic and learn to adapt to this.\"", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/energy/record-gas-prices-causes/index.html", "title": "Why US gas prices are at a record and why they'll stay high for a ...", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a major reason that US drivers are paying record prices for gasoline . But it's not the only cause of the spike.\n\nNumerous factors are pushing prices up, with regular gasoline hitting a record $4.87 a gallon Monday according to AAA's survey — up 25 cents a gallon in just the last week.\n\nGas prices were already expected to breach the $4 a gallon mark for the first time since 2008, with or without shots fired in Eastern Europe or economic sanctions imposed on Russia. But now the national average is expected to hit $5 a gallon within the next two weeks, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA.\n\n\"I think we reach $5 somewhere between this weekend and Juneteenth/Father's Day weekend,\" he said.\n\nIt was back in March that prices first broke the record of $4.11 a gallon, which had stood since 2008. That now seems like the good old days: The national average has been rising steadily for the past month, setting 27 records in the last 28 days.\n\nMore than one out of every five gas stations nationwide is now charging more than $5 a gallon for regular, and just more than half are charging $4.75.\n\nThere are 10 states, plus Washington, DC, where the average price is already at $5 or more: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Several more are within a penny of $5, so those states' prices are likely only a day or two at most from crossing the mark.\n\nThat's because there's a number of reasons beside the disruption of Russian oil exports driving prices higher according to Kloza. And making predictions about where prices will go has proved difficult. As school let out and summer travel picks up, so will gasoline demand and price, he said.\n\n\"Anything goes from June 20 to Labor Day,\" Kloza said. \"We could certainly see the national average approach $6.\"\n\nHere's what's behind the record price surge:\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia is one of the largest oil exporters on the planet. In December it sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, 5 million of them as crude oil.\n\nVery little of that went to the United States. In 2021 Europe got 60% of the oil and 20% went to China. But oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the loss of Russian oil affects prices around the globe no matter where it is used.\n\nThe concerns about disrupting global markets led Western nations to initially exempt Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they put in place to protest the invasion.\n\nChina lockdowns ending\n\nOne factor keeping oil prices somewhat in check has been the surge of Covid cases, and strict lockdown rules in much of the country. That was a major drag on demand for oil.\n\nBut as the Covid surge has started to retreat, the lockdowns are being lifted in major cities such as Shanghai. And more demand without increased supply can only drive up prices.\n\nJUST WATCHED This is what determines the price of gas Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This is what determines the price of gas 01:57\n\nLess oil and gas from other sources\n\nUS oil companies don't adhere to those types of nationally mandated production targets. But they have been reluctant or unable to resume producing oil at pre-pandemic levels amid concerns that tougher environmental rules could cut future demand. Many of those stricter rules have been scaled back or failed to become law.\n\n\"The Biden administration is suddenly interested in more drilling, not less,\" Robert McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, said earlier this spring. \"People are more worried about high oil prices than anything else.\"\n\nIt takes time to scale up production, particularly when oil companies are facing the same supply chain and hiring challenges as thousands of other US businesses.\n\n\"They can't find people, and can't find equipment,\" McNally added. \"It's not like they're available at a premium price. They're just not available.\"\n\nOil stocks have generally lagged the broader market over the last two years, at least until the recent run-up in prices. Oil company executives would rather find ways to boost their share price than increase production.\n\n\"Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,\" Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, said earlier this spring. \"They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks, instead of the proverbial 'drill baby drill,' which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.\"\n\nExxonMobil XOM One of the starkest examples:last month announced first quarter profits of $8.8 billion, more than triple the level of a year ago when excluding special items. It also announced a $30 billion share repurchase plan , far more than the $21 billion to $24 billion it expects to spend on all capital investment, including searching for new oil.\n\nNot only is oil production l agging behind pre-pandemic levels, US refining capacity is falling. Today, about 1 million fewer barrels of oil a day are available to be processed into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n\nState and federal environmental rules are prompting some refineries to switch from oil to lower carbon renewable fuels. Some companies are closing older refineries rather than investing what it would cost to retool to keep them operating, especially with massive new refineries set to open overseas in Asia, the Middle East and Africa in 2023.\n\nAnd the fact that diesel and jet fuel prices are up far more than gasoline prices shows that refiners are shifting more of their production to those products.\n\n\"Economics mandate you make more jet and diesel fuel to the detriment of gasoline,\" said Kloza.\n\nAnd with prices in Europe even higher than in the United States, both Canadian and US oil producers have increased exports of oil and gasoline to the continent. That has also limited the US supply.\n\nStrong demand for gas\n\nBut supply is only part of the equation for prices. Demand is the other key, and while it's very strong right now, it's still not back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nJUST WATCHED How to save money on gas by being more fuel efficient Replay More Videos ...

Demand is getting another boost as the many employees who have been working from home for much of the last two years return to the office\n\nThe start of the summer travel season on Memorial Day weekend likely sparked the typical annual increases in demand for gas and jet fuel. US airlines all report very strong bookings for summer travel, even with airfares climbing above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe end of the Omicron surge and the removal of many Covid restrictions is encouraging people to get out of the house for more shopping, entertainment and travel.\n\n\"Come hell or high gas prices, people are going to take vacations,\" said Kloza.\n\nCommuting may remain down slightly. Many who plan to return to the office will be there only three or four days a week, and the total number of jobs is still a bit below 2019 levels. But there will be periods, most likely this summer, with higher demand for gas than during comparable periods before the pandemic, Kloza predicts.\n\n\"Even before Ukraine, I was expecting to break the record,\" Kloza said. \"Now it's a question of how much we break the record by.\"", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}]}

On Aug. 12, 2,400 East Germans cross into West Berlin, the most in a single day. The next day, with the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, East Germany begins building a wall that would extend 27 miles through Berlin, dividing families and friends for the next 28 years. The wall would serve as an enduring symbol of the Cold War, used by presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to inspire a divided city.\n\n1962: Cuban missile crisis\n\n• Date: Oct.16-28\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWhen the United States learns that the Soviet Union is building nuclear missile installations 90 miles south of Miami in communist Cuba, the Kennedy administration enacts a naval blockade around the island, which is at times tested, to demand the removal of the missiles. The standoff is widely considered to be the closest the two nuclear superpowers come to direct military confrontation. Cooler heads prevail. The Soviet Union offers to remove the missiles in exchange for a guarantee that the United States will not invade Cuba. In secret, the administration also agrees to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey.\n\n1963: JFK assassinated\n\n• Date: Nov. 22\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nAs John F. Kennedy prepares for his re-election bid, the 34th president of the United States embarks on a multi-state tour in September 1963.

Johnson struggles to shift focus away from the Vietnam War and on his stated goals of reducing poverty, ending segregation, and establishing the social programs that many Americans rely on to this day, including the immensely popular Medicare program. During his “War on Poverty” State of the Union Address of Jan. 8, 1964, LBJ outlines the need for the country to reduce poverty, end racial discrimination, attend to the health needs of the elderly, and other progressive goals. LBJ later ushers in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965.\n\n1965: Selma to Montgomery march\n\n• Date: March 7\n\n• Location: Selma, Alabama\n\nThe fatal shooting of protester Jimmy Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper sparks a march in the state from Selma to Montgomery.

A ceasefire goes into effect on June 10.\n\n1968: Dream denied\n\n• Date: April 4\n\n• Location: Memphis, Tennessee\n\nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is fatally shot by James Earl Ray as the civil rights icon stands on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, a tragedy that sparks race riots nationwide. King’s influence in words and actions touch and move not only the nation, but the world, and resonate to this day. Two months later, on June 4, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and brother of John F. Kennedy, is fatally shot by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab Christian from Jerusalem, who believes Kennedy is “instrumental” in oppressing Palestinians.\n\n1969: Landing on the moon\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Moon\n\nPresident Kennedy’s goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 is realized six years after his assassination. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins blast off from the Kennedy Space Center at 9:32 a.m. aboard the Saturn V rocket. After three days of travel, Armstrong and Aldrin land the Eagle module on the lunar surface as Collins remains in lunar orbit to pilot the module. Upon their return to Earth, the three astronauts are put in 21-day quarantine to ensure they did not bring back any lunar contagions.\n\n1970: Vietnam War turns to Cambodia\n\n• Date: April 29\n\n• Location: Eastern Cambodia\n\nAlthough the United States should be scaling back U.S. troop presence in Vietnam, President Richard Nixon approves an operation with the South Vietnamese to invade Cambodia to oust Northern Vietnamese forces there. The Cambodian incursion inflames anti-war protests in the United States as it is perceived to be an escalation of U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.\n\n1971: Pentagon Papers\n\n• Date: Feb. 8\n\n• Location: Laos\n\nThe Pentagon Papers, a study by the U.S. Department of Defense about the country's involvement in the Vietnam war, are released and published first in The New York Times, then other newspapers. The documents expose several missteps and how several administrations have misled the American public about how involved the military was and about plans to escalate the war in 1964. They also reveal an expanded campaign in Cambodia and Laos, especially clandestine bombing in Laos, which today is considered the heaviest bombardment in history.\n\n1972: Nixon goes to China\n\n• Date: Feb. 21\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nNixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprises the American public by traveling to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step towards normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars in the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.\n\n1973: Roe v. Wade\n\n• Date: Jan. 22\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nIn a landmark 7-2 decision that will be known as Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court rules that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. The court adds that as the pregnancy develops the state can balance a woman’s right to privacy with its interest in preserving the “potentiality of human life.” As a result, states can ban abortion in the third trimester except in cases where a pregnancy affects a woman’s health.\n\n1974: Nixon resigns\n\n• Date: Aug. 8\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon announces his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt resist a congressional investigation.

The total number of fatal casualties for the United States is 58,220.\n\n1976: The Concorde changes air travel\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: London and Paris\n\nTwo supersonic Concorde jets take off simultaneously – one from London to Bahrain, operated by British Airways, and the other from Paris to Rio de Janeiro via Dakar in Senegal, operated by Air France – marking the first time paying passengers enjoy commercial travel at faster than the speed of sound. Though travel by one of the 16 Concordes ever put into service could slash travel time from New York to London in half, the high cost of maintenance, soaring ticket prices, as well as a fatal accident in 2000, would seal the fate of the narrow, slope-nosed aircraft.\n\n1977: Rise of the personal computer\n\n• Date: January\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nPersonal home computers began to emerge in the 1970s, but many of the earliest versions resembled calculators that would plug into televisions sets. By 1977, however, the desktop home computer begins to resemble the more modern versions – with an accompanying, attached or separate, computer screen and a magnetic tape or floppy disk storage device. The Commodore PET is unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago that year, while the first Apple II and Radio Shack’s TRS-80 also go on sale.\n\n1978: Cult's mass suicide\n\n• Date: Nov. 18\n\n• Location: Jonestown, Guyana\n\nMore than 900 people die in one of worst recorded acts of cult-related mass murder-suicide as nearly all the victims and perpetrators drink a powdered drink mix laced with cyanide. Most of the victims are Americans, devotees of Peoples Temple cult leader Jim Jones, a former Methodist-trained preacher who built a following and led the flock to Guyana. Among the dead are 276 children. A small number of cult defectors are killed by Peoples Temple gunmen who also slay Leo Ryan, California Congressman who had gone to Guyana to investigate Jonestown.\n\n1979: Islamic Republic born in Iran\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Tehran\n\nWorsening economic conditions, increasing discontent with the government, and wide support for religious leader in exile Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini end the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The shah and his family flee Iran in January 1979. On Feb. 11, the monarchy is dissolved, and on April 1, Khomeini declares Iran an Islamic republic. With support among the nation’s clergy and their many followers, he begins rebuilding Iranian society based on conservative Shiite religious principles. In November, a mob raids the U.S. embassy, taking more than 60 Americans hostage. The crisis would be influential in the following year's presidential election and would not fully resolve until January 1981.\n\n1980: Reagan elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 4\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the United States in an economic malaise and the Iranian hostage crisis hobbling the presidency of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan is elected the 40th president in a landslide. Reagan, who would serve two terms, was the oldest man elected president at the time. Reagan’s election changes the trajectory of American politics, ushering in an era of conservative leadership. During his tenure, he takes a more aggressive approach to the Soviet Union and increases defense spending. Reagan convinces Congress to cut taxes, a move that many economists credit with triggering an economic boom in the 1980s.\n\n1981: AIDS impacts America\n\n• Date: June 5\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes a report about five gay men who had been diagnosed by local physicians with a rare form of pneumonia – the first reported U.S. cases of what would later become known as HIV/AIDS. The infectious autoimmune disease spreads so fast that by the end of the 1982, 500 Americans would die from what the CDC later calls acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The death toll would rise to 5,000 by 1985.\n\n1982: Mexico triggers regional debt crisis\n\n• Date: Aug 12\n\n• Location: Mexico City\n\nGlobal economic stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s as well as excessive borrowing among Latin America’s biggest economies boils over when Mexico’s Finance Minister Jesús Silva-Herzog tells the U.S. Federal Reserve his country can no longer service its debt of $80 billion. After the announcement, lenders realize virtually every country in Latin America, led by Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, is not able to pay back loans. The crisis would lead to years of eroding wages, weak to negative economic growth, sky-high unemployment, severe austerity measures, and political instability – known as the “lost decade” in Latin America.\n\n1983: The internet is born\n\n• Date: Jan. 1\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nThe internet as we know it today – a seemingly endless collection of websites hosted on servers scattered across the globe – is still more than a decade away. At the beginning of 1983, however, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space. The protocol also decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history’s worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade. Though the meeting yields little of substance, it initiates a closer relationship between the two men, who both seem committed to scaling back the nuclear arms race between the two nuclear superpowers.\n\n1986: Chernobyl disaster\n\n• Date: Apr. 26\n\n• Location: Prypyat, Soviet Union\n\nA combination of poor design and human error leads to a power surge in a reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. This leads to a massive explosion that puts highly radioactive material into the air. Soviet officials try to cover up the incident, but Swedish scientists notice the increased levels of radioactivity. It takes a little over a week for the radioactive emissions to be contained, but by then radioactive particles had already spread thousands of miles by wind currents to countries as far away as France. A 1,600 square mile area around the plant known as the “exclusion zone” is deemed unsafe, and more than 220,000 people have to be resettled. The radiation causes deformities in nearby livestock and cancer in many people near the blast. Though exact figures are hard to come by, the UN reports years later there were over 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children who were in the affected areas. The Chernobyl disaster is still considered the worst nuclear power failure in history.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%, on Oct. 19, 1987, later referred to as Black Monday. The drop, in percentage terms, is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates, and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\n1988: End of fighting in Iran-Iraq war\n\n• Date: July 20\n\n• Location: Iraq-Iran border\n\nFrom 1980 to 1988, neighboring Middle East countries Iran and Iraq are engaged in a protracted war. It begins when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launches an attack on Iran in 1980, sensing an opportunity in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iraqi forces initially make incursions into Iranian land, but they lose the area gained in 1982 after Iran is able to mobilize its military and repel the Iraqi forces. Hussein seeks a peace deal that year, but Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini refuses. From 1982 to 1988, the fighting is characterized by sporadic missile launches, attacks on each others’ oil tankers, and the use of chemical weapons, mostly by the Iraqis. By 1988, Iran’s economy is in dire straits, forcing Iran to agree to a UN-brokered ceasefire. The two countries signed an official peace treaty in 1990. Anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million troops were killed in the war and up to 100,000 Kurds.\n\n1989: The Berlin Wall falls\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Berlin, East and West Germany\n\nCracks in the monolithic Soviet bloc are starting to appear in the 1980s, and the very symbol of communist repression comes crashing down in November, when the Berlin Wall is breached, ending a 28-year division of the city. During the day on Nov. 9, a spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party says that starting at midnight that day, citizens of East Germany would be free to cross the country’s borders. Almost immediately Berliners start slamming the wall with axes and sledgehammers. By nightfall, the celebration turns into what one observer calls “the greatest street party in the history of the world,” and the city is reunited. East and West Germany would reunite one year later.\n\n1990: Democracy in Poland\n\n• Date: Jan. 28\n\n• Location: Poland\n\nWith the hold of the Soviet Union and communism on East Europe loosening, Poland's ruling communist party votes to dissolve and become more moderate.

With Saudi Arabia secured, the United States implements Operation Desert Storm to push Iraqi forces back across the border with Kuwait in a military operation that lasts until a ceasefire takes effect in April.\n\n1992: Cold War ends\n\n• Date: Feb. 1\n\n• Location: Camp David, Maryland\n\nJust weeks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec. 26, 1991, U.S. President George H.W. Bush and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, meet at Camp David to formally declare the end of the Cold War that began shortly after the end of World War II. The meeting comes days after both countries announce they would stop aiming nuclear missiles at each other. Russia declares its 11 former communist satellite republics – from Armenia to Uzbekistan – independent.\n\n1993: The EU becomes reality\n\n• Date: Nov. 1\n\n• Location: Brussels\n\nThe Treaty of the European Union, also known as the Maastricht Treaty, goes into effect in November, after a rough series of political wrangling. Among other concessions, the treaty allows the U.K. and Denmark to opt out of the common euro currency. The treaty opens the way to removing border controls among member states and invites new members to join the union.\n\n1994: Rwandan genocide\n\n• Date: April-July\n\n• Location: Rwanda\n\nFor decades, Rwanda has been embroiled in a conflict between the country's two major ethnic groups – the Hutu and the Tutsi. Over 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people are killed, mostly Tutsis, but some moderate Hutus as well. When Tutsi militant group eventually gains control of the country, some two million Rwandans flee to nearby African nations. In 2008, three former Rwandan officials are convicted by an international court of organizing the genocide.\n\n1995: Domestic terror strikes Oklahoma\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Oklahoma City\n\nIn the deadliest domestic terrorist attack in U.S. history, anti-government radicals Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. They time the truck-bomb attack for a weekday morning in order to maximize casualties. For the murder of at least 168 people, including 19 children who were in a child-care center in the building, and the injury of hundreds of others, an unremorseful McVeigh is executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Nichols is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n'You can do better':Jeff Bezos ripped for $690K Australian wildfire relief donation\n\nCutting the cord:As prices go up, here's how you can still save money streaming\n\n1996: The dawn of cloning\n\n• Date: July 5\n\n• Location: Midlothian, Scotland, U.K.\n\nDolly the Sheep enters the annals of bioengineering when scientists at Scotland’s Roslin Institute become the first to not only successfully clone a mammal, but also the first to do so using an adult cell rather than an embryonic one.

The action incites peals of condemnation from world leaders and a raft of economic sanctions against Moscow. This strategically important and predominantly Russian-speaking region on the Black Sea has been coveted by the Russians as part of their strategic efforts to check NATO expansion along Russia’s western border.\n\n2015: NASA flies by Pluto\n\n• Date: July 14\n\n• Location: 3 billion miles from Earth\n\nNASA spacecraft New Horizons becomes the first human-made object to fly past and observe the dwarf planet Pluto. New Horizons sends back stunning photographs of this enigmatic and distant member of the solar system, including images of a mountain range and massive icebergs floating in frozen nitrogen. New Horizons is now en route to the Kuiper Belt, a massive asteroid belt at the far reaches of the solar system.\n\n2016: Trump elected\n\n• Date: Nov. 8\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nRunning on a populist agenda, Donald Trump is elected the 45th president of the United States and the fifth president in U.S. history (the second since the 2000) to win despite losing the popular vote. The real estate developer and television personality ran on a platform of putting “America First” in global trade and foreign policy negotiations and cracking down on undocumented immigrants.\n\n2017: Hurricane triple whammy\n\n• Date: August-September\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWithin just four weeks, three massive hurricanes – Harvey, Irma, and Maria – strike Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean, killing 228 people, inflicting a combined $265 billion in damages, and displacing millions of homeowners. Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling due to economic insolvency.\n\n2018: Wildfires\n\n• Date: November\n\n• Location: Northern California\n\nThe deadliest wildfires in the state’s history engulf northern California in November. The catastrophe costs the lives of 88 people, and the fire consumes 18,500 homes and businesses. State and federal officials estimate that it would cost $3 billion to clean up debris. Climate change activists say the conflagrations are evidence that global warming is no longer a distant concern and that it is occurring now.\n\n2019: Trump impeached\n\n• Date: Dec. 18\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2019, Donald Trump becomes just the third U.S. president to be impeached. A whistleblower reveals that in July Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as well as cybersecurity company Crowdstrike. These requests were made just after Zelensky said Ukraine wanted to buy weapons from the United States. After the call comes to light, Democratic leaders file two articles of impeachment – for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They say Trump abused his power by using the office of the president to target a political opponent. The obstruction of Congress charge stems from accusations that Trump Administration officials tried to cover up the whistleblower’s report. Trump calls the investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any wrongdoing. The House passes both articles in a vote that goes almost entirely along party lines, moving the impeachment proceedings along to the Senate.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Located just west of the downtown area near the Alabama River, the estimated $50 million Montgomery Whitewater is set to open in 2023 with a combination of public contributions and private financing. Officials gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday. Using a system that recirculates water, the project will include whitewater rafting, kayaking, paddle boats and canoeing. It will also have mountain bike trails, climbing areas, zip lines and rope courses. Montgomery got a boost in tourism when a national lynching memorial opened in 2018, and officials hope the whitewater development brings additional people to town while revitalizing an area near Interstate 65. “The whitewater project can be a catalyst to transform our city and this entire region. We are being intentional in our work to attract new opportunities for growth and investment by marketing areas outside of traditional development zones,” Mayor Steven Reed said in a statement. The park is expected to employ about 640 people with an estimated financial impact of more than $35 million annually.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The federal government announced plans Friday to “repeal or replace” a decision by the Trump administration last fall to lift restrictions on logging and road building in a southeast Alaska rainforest that provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. Conservationists cheered the announcement as a positive step, while Republican Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy criticized it and vowed to use “every tool available to push back.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plans were announced on a federal regulatory site with little detail. They were described as consistent with a January executive order from President Joe Biden that called for reviewing agency actions during the Trump administration that could be at odds with Biden’s environmental priorities. The U.S. Forest Service falls under the USDA. The Tongass National Forest is the country’s largest national forest. In a statement, Matt Herrick, an Agriculture Department spokesperson, said the Trump administration decision “did not align with the overwhelming majority of public opinion across the country and among Alaskans.” The Agriculture Department last October decided to exempt the Tongass from the so-called roadless rule, which prohibited road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions. That rule, dating to 2001, has long been the subject of litigation.\n\nArizona\n\nSierra Vista: Operators of a new youth community center are hoping it becomes an inviting hangout for the town of Naco – the one in Arizona and the one in Mexico. El Centro Community Center, just a stone’s throw from the Mexican border, opened its doors this month. The facility is in its early stages, with details still being decided, but classes will be offered in person and online. Its founders envision a bicultural refuge where students on both sides could learn about art, music and each other. Co-founders Lori Keyne and Seth Polley said they want teens to celebrate different cultures while gaining valuable skills. “In the aftermath of COVID, it’s good to be with each other,” Polley, a history teacher at Bisbee High School and former reverend, told the Sierra Vista Herald/Bisbee Review. “We would like to have a space where people can come together for various activities, music, language, have a coffee, a place to hang out.” Keyne, a music teacher at Cochise College and the founder of Concerts Without Borders and the Bi-National Arts Institute, said she wants to impart knowledge not only about the arts but also on subjects like job skills and entrepreneurship. The center includes a front room lounge with a bar area where coffee will be served, with teens interested in understanding how a business works helping to run it.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman who says she was injured when a state trooper deliberately bumped into her SUV, causing it to flip, when she didn’t immediately pull over for a traffic stop is suing him and the agency. An attorney for Janice Nicole Harper filed the lawsuit last month in Pulaski County against trooper Rodney Dunn, several of his supervisors and the Arkansas State Police, alleging negligence and excessive use of force. The suit alleges that Harper slowed down, activated her blinker and emergency lights, and was looking for a safe place to pull over after Dunn initiated a traffic stop in July 2020. Dashboard video from Dunn’s cruiser shows the trooper performed a “pursuit intervention technique,” or PIT maneuver, about two minutes after initiating the stop. “There were no exits or shoulder for plaintiff to safely exit the highway, before defendant Dunn negligently executed a PIT maneuver on plaintiff’s vehicle two minutes and seven seconds after defendant Dunn initiated his Arkansas State Police patrol cruiser overhead lights, which caused plaintiff’s vehicle to flip,” the lawsuit says. The state police have not formally responded to the lawsuit, and a spokesman for the agency declined to comment Friday because the lawsuit is pending.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The federal government has reached an agreement to restore nearly $1 billion in funding for California’s troubled bullet train, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced. The U.S. Department of Transportation finalized settlement negotiations to restore the money for the high-speed rail project that was revoked by the Trump administration in 2019, Newsom said Thursday night. The restoration of $929 million in grant funding “will continue to spur job creation, advance the project and move the state one step closer to getting trains running in California as soon as possible,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. California voters in 2008 approved nearly $10 billion in bond money to build a high-speed rail line connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco that was supposed to be running by 2020. But the project was plagued by cost overruns and delays. Officials now hope to have trains running on a segment through the state’s central valley agricultural region by 2029. Critics have derided the segment as a “train to nowhere,” but supporters say it’s a necessary test and precursor to linking more populated areas. The project’s business plan anticipates environmental approval for the 500 miles between Los Angeles and San Francisco by 2023. Completion of the full line depends on funding and other unknowns.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Legislature launched an ambitious path to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating economic and social consequences during the 2021 session, with majority Democrats doling out millions of dollars to dozens of business and health care needs. They also strengthened a state greenhouse gas emissions plan, passed gun measures, and mandated reduced health insurance premiums and costs for individuals and small businesses. A transportation funding plan that eluded lawmakers for years was approved, as were measures addressing racial disparities in health care and criminal justice. And lawmakers followed up on a sweeping 2020 police accountability bill that was passed during protests over the killing of George Floyd. Republicans fought in vain against a hastily prepared, last-minute bill that, in part, requires rural electric cooperatives – and power providers including larger utilities – to prepare clean energy plans for the state. It also directs the Air Quality Control Commission, a panel appointed by the governor, to create fees on greenhouse gas emissions and regulate emissions sources that directly affect lower-income Coloradans and communities of color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSomers: The state has closed the maximum-security prison that once housed the state’s death row. Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday that the Northern Correctional Institution, the state’s highest-security prison, was taken out of service three weeks ahead of the target date of July 1. The decision to close the prison was announced in February. Northern is the first of three prisons the Connecticut Department of Correction plans to shutter amid lower crime rates and an inmate population that has declined during the pandemic. The state has yet to name the other two. The state’s inmate population has been hovering around 9,000 in recent weeks, a drop of about 3,400 people over the past 15 months. Northern, which was designed in pods to keep high-security inmates isolated, once housed more than 500 prisoners but has not had more than 100 in more than a year. In February, a lawsuit filed on behalf of prisoners alleged the use of prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling was violating the rights of mentally ill inmates. Last week the General Assembly passed legislation banning the use of solitary confinement in most cases and the use of certain restraints. The last of Northern’s inmates were transferred to other high-security settings last Monday, Lamont’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: A conservation group says about 200,000 juvenile menhaden died in a fish kill off Rehoboth Bay. The Delaware Center for the Inland Bays said a lack of dissolved oxygen in the water was responsible for the kill. Residents discovered the dead fish Thursday in a residential canal. Menhaden are a small, oily bait fish that serve as a food source for other species and a prime source for fish oil supplements. While it may have once been a natural tributary of Rehoboth Bay, the canal was at some point altered to allow boats to travel and dock there, said Chris Bason, executive director of the inland bays center. It features manmade walls as opposed to a natural shoreline. “It’s no longer done that way because it has tremendous environmental impacts,” Bason said. “That’s how we lost a lot of our salt marshes around the inland bays.” Such canals can be heavily polluted by runoff from adjacent properties, and Bason said some homes even pipe stormwater directly into the canals. Because they weren’t created by tides’ natural ebb and flow, they often have poor flushing. “It can create dangerous environmental conditions for the animals,” Bason said. While urban runoff is a major cause of pollution in Rehoboth Bay, Bason said the biggest contributor is likely fertilizer and treated wastewater applied to farmlands.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In what organizers say was a surprise turn of events, the Capital Pride Alliance has hosted its first in-person Pride event since the pandemic hit, WUSA-TV reports. The district fully reopened Friday, allowing for crowds to storm the streets Saturday afternoon, sporting the hallmark rainbows of LGBTQ flags. “We’ve been locked up for so long, and just the feeling of being able to come out and come together as a family as a community is huge,” Capital Pride Alliance President Ashley Smith said. Hundreds marched from DuPont Circle to Freedom Plaza, where Mayor Muriel Bowser spoke. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, met the crowds en route. Harris spoke, walked and waved to Pride supporters. “We understand the importance of this movement and our roles of leadership in this ongoing movement,” Harris said about the Biden administration’s support of the LGBTQ community. She also spoke about securing further rights for those of the transgender community at a time when school districts and legislatures across the country are facing debates about inclusion in sports and the use of pronouns that reflect students’ gender identity.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Friday that is meant to give relief to a large sector of the state’s insurance industry. Faced with losses from rising claims, the industry welcomed changes that would restrict some practices by contractors. The law would forbid contractors from soliciting homeowners to file roofing claims. It also narrows the time frame in which homeowners can file claims from three years to two years and enacts new rules on litigation. While some insurers say the new measures will help keep costs down, critics say they could raise premiums on homeowners who get coverage from the state’s provider of last resort. The same legislation raised the cap on annual rate increases that the government-backed insurer, Citizens Property Insurance, can charge its customers. That cap will rise from 10% to 15% over the next five years. Insurers had sought much more from lawmakers during this year’s legislative session but had to settle for a scaled-back bill that removed some key provisions – including one that would have allowed insurers to more strictly limit coverage for replacing damaged roofs. The Republican governor signed the bill after holding a brief roundtable in Sarasota.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: The pastor of a vandalized church said he doesn’t want to seek criminal charges but instead seeks to reach out to the person who left the graffiti. “My concern was not about the building. It was about the person,” Will Dyer told WJBF-TV on Tuesday after finding “God is dead” and “Christians are the problem” spray-painted on the walls of First Baptist Church. “I know you probably won’t read this post, but if you do, I would love to meet you. I would love to hear your story and share a meal at the table,” Dyer wrote on Facebook. “If you sit down at a table and you share a meal with someone, you might not emerge agreeing on everything, but it’s hard to hate someone that you share a meal with.” The pastor said he wants to use the incident to spread his message. “I had no idea it would go viral, but I thought, ‘What would I want to say to the person who did this?’ ” Dyer said. He said the church “will absolutely not press charges.” “That is not something we are interested in,” Dyer said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKekaha: Researchers have documented a decrease in Kauai’s population of rose-ringed parakeets, an invasive species plaguing local farms. The island had a minimum of 7,300 of the parakeets this year, down from 10,500 last year, said Jane Anderson, assistant professor of research at Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute of Texas A&M University – Kingsville. Tiffani Keanini, manager of Kauai Invasive Species Committee, said her organization launched a campaign to get people to report parakeets roosts, where large numbers of the birds gather to sleep at night. Mango farmer Wally Johnson of Kekaha told The Garden Island newspaper he first saw the parakeets six to seven years ago. He’s had workers scare them away with shotguns. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Wildlife Research Center suggests controlling their numbers by capturing birds with live traps or with long-handled nets at roosting spots. Anderson said Kauai’s parakeets are believed to have descended from pets that were released in the 1960s. They damage crops because they flock in groups of 50 to 100. They’re been known to eat corn, lychee, citrus, mango, longan and papaya. “This is impacting the large cornfields as well as local fruit farms and backyard growers,” Anderson said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A woman whose visit to China turned into a year-and-a-half exile because of the pandemic finally returned home this month, only to find her home practically unlivable, plundered by a bevy of squatters. “I came back from vacation and found my house in a mess,” Helen Wong, 70, told The Lewiston Tribune. “I cannot do it (clean up by myself). I feel so helpless.” But a deputy from the Nez Perce County Sheriff’s Office rallied the community to help her get things back in order. Jesse Broyles happened upon Wong outside the county jail as she was trying in vain to replace her ID, and the story Wong told floored him. The COVID-19 outbreak slammed the door on her return from a “vacation” to her homeland in late 2019. China eventually eased its travel restrictions, but Wong just recently decided her health would be safe in the tight confines of a jumbo jet. Then she arrived home to find it abused and partially dismantled by squatters, 18 of whom had to be rousted by the Lewiston Police Department, and almost all her belongings were stolen. To make matters worse, her wallet went missing that day, and without her proof of residency, she couldn’t even replace her ID so that she could pay for groceries with a check. Spurred by a Facebook post from Broyles, volunteers and donors have stepped in to get Wong through the crisis.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A bus driver looking for a way to relieve stress during the coronavirus pandemic jumped into Lake Michigan for a 365th straight day Saturday. Dan O’Conor said he started jumping into the lake at Montrose Harbor on the city’s North Side last year to relieve stress. “It was during the pandemic, it was during the protest, it was during an election year … so it was somewhere where I could come down here and block all that noise out and kind of be totally present with me in the lake and find some moments of Zen,” the father of three said. He continued his lake jumps through the fall before the hard part: hacking a hole in the ice on the frozen lake that was big enough for him to jump through during the winter. He said when he got home after one such jump, he found about 20 scrapes and cuts on his body. He was encouraged by the response he got for his undertaking. “People started asking me what this was benefiting and how they could support – and when I say people, I’m talking strangers online, you know. When I started posting the videos on Twitter and Instagram ... I got more wind in my sails there because people started commenting like, ‘This makes my day, it’s nice to see this,’ ” he said. Saturday was special because it was the culmination of doing it for a full year. “I just wanted to celebrate just that drive to dive for 365,” O’Conor said.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: Former Vice President Mike Pence is spending his post-vice presidency days in a $1.93million house he and his wife, Karen, purchased in Hamilton County, according to the sales disclosure form. The 10,300-square-foot house, which sits on a 5-acre lot on the northwest side of Carmel, has seven bedrooms, 7.5 bathrooms and an in-ground pool, according to a Realtor.com listing. There’s also a dock overlooking a pond, an indoor basketball court and a lower-level media room. Pictures of the house – built in 2008, according to Realtor.com – show four garages, a spacious basement bar, a workout room and a stone fireplace on the main level. The house has a Zionsville postal address but is within the city limits of Carmel, which voted primarily for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. But Pence – along with former President Donald Trump – won overall in Hamilton County with 52.2% of the vote. Biden received more than 51% of the vote in Carmel and Clay Township in 2020, according to an analysis in November. Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard, a Republican, welcomed Pence to the city and pointed out that Pence would not be the first vice president to settle in Carmel, following in the footsteps of Dan Quayle, a native Hoosier who served as vice president from 1989 to 1993 under George H.W. Bush.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: The bright red Quaker Oats sign that had long lit up the Cedar Rapids skyline before a rare wind storm damaged it last August is back atop the Quaker Oats plant near downtown. The new sign installed June 1 is a near-exact replica of the old sign but sports all LED lights and took hundreds of hours of labor over six months to reconstruct, The Gazette reports. The previous neon sign first lit up in 1947 and was the largest electric sign in the city at the time. Nesper Sign Advertising of Cedar Rapids created the new version, and Nesper president Phil Garland said it uses about one-sixth of the power of the old sign. “It’s not glass, so it’s safer as far as if it ever were to get broken in a storm – falling glass is obviously not a good thing,” Garland said. Nesper Sign also will replace a second sign at the plant, facing the Cedar River.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Psychiatric facilities have enough beds to treat children in need of intensive mental health care in the state, but a worker shortage means that about 100 of those spots remain empty. Kansas News Service reports that in recent years, children have often waited months for openings in specialized facilities that offer long-term psychiatric care. In mid-2018, the average wait was nearly 200 days. The wait time fell in 2019 and 2020, and as of last month, the average wait was 44 days. Yet 146 children remain in line for their turn, even though 104 beds are open. Residential care centers are struggling to fill jobs that are physically and emotionally taxing yet sometimes pay less than $15 an hour. KidsTLC in Olathe is urging the state to help with incentives that could range from college tuition waivers and signing bonuses to subsidies for health insurance or child care. KidsTLC bought land in March 2020 to add another 50 beds for children, and that work was finished in December, nearly doubling KidsTLC’s residential capacity. Forty-five of the new beds remain empty. “We had space; we were licensed and were feeling just exceptional about that and being able to make a significant dent in that waitlist,” CEO Erin Dugan said. “And then it became really hard to hire staff.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday declared his state’s deadly fight against COVID-19 a “success story” as he ended most pandemic restrictions, and he said his state lessened the crisis because Kentuckians ultimately put science ahead of politics. The Democratic governor – who confronted protests, lawsuits and impeachment petitions over his coronavirus-related executive actions – expressed frustration that mask mandates meant to slow the virus’s spread became a “question of liberty.” Bringing the coronavirus under control required collective efforts of Democrats and Republicans, offering a lesson to move beyond the partisan strife that “can just be toxic,” Beshear said in an interview with the Associated Press, the first sit-down interview he had given in person in more than a year. Shortly before announcing he was lifting capacity restrictions for restaurants, bars and other venues, Beshear said the pandemic was “a test of our humanity” and posed “the single deadliest threat” of his lifetime. Kentucky’s virus-related death toll has surpassed 7,000. Still, “when you look at our response, I think you see a success story, and that’s obviously comparative and based on what could have happened,” Beshear said. “We know that our actions saved thousands, likely tens of thousands of lives,” he said later at his last media briefing on the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: For the second year in a row, organizers have canceled a Halloween weekend music festival in the city. Last year’s Voodoo Music and Arts Experience was among many festivals around the world canceled last year because of COVID-19-related restrictions. A brief message posted Thursday on the festival’s website didn’t say why there won’t be one this October. People who have already bought tickets will be emailed about options to use them in 2022 or get refunds, it said. “As our city reopens with an abundance of events to reconnect with, we look forward to holding our reunion when we can fully embrace the Voodoo experience,” the statement said. With Louisiana’s pandemic restrictions over, other festivals are coming back. French Quarter Festivals Inc. announced weeks ago that its Satchmo Summerfest would take place July 31-Aug. 1. On Thursday it released the lineup for the city’s first post-pandemic in-person festival. The Essence Festival of Culture, which was online last year, plans a hybrid festival June 25-27 and July 2-4. Several spring festivals have been moved to the fall. The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival will be Oct. 8-17, bracketed by the French Quarter Festival on Sept. 30-Oct. 3 and Buku: Planet B on Oct. 22-23.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gov. Janet Mills announced Friday that the state of civil emergency she declared at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic will expire at month’s end. The Democrat called the end of the emergency orders put in place 15 months ago “a welcome milestone” that demonstrates the state’s progress in getting people vaccinated and reducing the spread of the virus. “Today, we take another important step forward in our return to normal,” the Democratic governor said. More than 73% of those 12 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and about 65% are fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination tracker. The governor said she extended the civil emergency order, due to expire June 13, a final time through June 30 to ensure an orderly transition out of the emergency. The state’s last remaining mask requirement, which only applies to students from elementary through high school while indoors and to those in child care settings, will also end June 30.\n\nMaryland\n\nSeverna Park: A rededication ceremony is planned for a lynching memorial marker that was damaged in a vehicle accident. The organization Connecting the Dots posted on Facebook that work began Thursday to install the marker at the Severna Park Library. The group posted photos showing volunteers preparing a foundation in the soil for the marker. The group said a rededication ceremony is scheduled for Tuesday evening. A discussion on slavery and its legacy of racism is planned for afterward. The marker was initially installed in 2019 to memorialize five victims of lynching in Anne Arundel County but was damaged by a bus. Connecting the Dots is an organization in the county that works on “connecting the dots between slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and police brutality against the Black community.” The rededication ceremony was first reported by The Capital Gazette.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A commercial lobster diver who got caught in the mouth of a humpback whale off the coast of Cape Cod on Friday morning said he thought he was going to die. Michael Packard, 56, of Wellfleet, was about 10 feet from the bottom of the water off Herring Cove Beach when, in something truly biblical, he was swallowed whole by the whale. “All of a sudden, I felt this huge shove, and the next thing I knew, it was completely black,” Packard recalled Friday afternoon following his release from Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis. “I could sense I was moving, and I could feel the whale squeezing with the muscles in his mouth.” Initially, Packard thought he was inside a great white shark, but he couldn’t feel any teeth and hadn’t suffered any obvious wounds. It quickly dawned on him that he had been swallowed by a whale. “I thought to myself, ‘There’s no way I’m getting out of here. I’m done. I’m dead.’ All I could think of was my boys – they’re 12 and 15 years old.” Outfitted with scuba gear, he struggled, and the whale began shaking its head such that Packard could tell he didn’t like it. He estimated he was in the whale for 30 to 40 seconds before it finally surfaced. “I saw light, and he started throwing his head side to side, and the next thing I knew, I was outside (in the water),” he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Republican-controlled Legislature can repeal a law that was the backbone of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s coronavirus orders, without her interference, after a unanimous decision Friday from the Michigan Supreme Court. The order to certify the ballot measure came after two Democrats on the Board of State Canvassers opposed ratifying it in April, despite a finding from the elections bureau that enough signatures had been collected. The justices said the panel “has a clear legal duty to certify the petition.” The seven-member board’s three Democrats had called for further investigation into alleged wrongdoing by paid circulators. For months, the Democratic governor acted under the 1945 emergency powers law to issue and keep intact restrictions on the economy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional last fall, but the conservative group Unlock Michigan wants to kill it to prevent a future court from deciding differently. Since the decision, Whitmer has turned to the state health department to tighten and ease restrictions. Indoor capacity limits will go away July 1, as will most mask requirements. The canvassers will meet soon to certify the petition. The GOP-controlled Legislature will likely enact the measure rather than let it go to a public vote in 2022.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota State Fair is coming back. The fair was canceled last year amid COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and social distancing recommendations. But fair officials announced Friday that the beloved event will return Aug. 26 and run through Labor Day on Sept. 6. Dubbed the “Great Minnesota Get-Back-Together,” a play on the fair’s traditional “Great Minnesota Get Together” moniker, the fair will not limit daily attendance or require masks, although fair officials ask that anyone who isn’t vaccinated against COVID-19 wear them. They did warn that some parts of the fair will look different. For example, the River Raft Ride, Go Karts, Giant Sing Along and Festival of Nations Demonstration Stage will not be offered this year. The llama costume contest will move to the Warner Coliseum, which offers more seating. The fair will feature dozens of newborn animals but no live births. The fairgrounds and most exhibits will close an hour earlier on Labor Day than in years past. Tickets purchased for the 2020 fair before it was canceled will be valid this year, officials said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Due to lagging demand for shots, the state has not accepted new COVID-19 vaccine doses from the federal government for two weeks and has asked that well over three-quarters of a million doses the U.S. government set aside for the state be transferred elsewhere, officials say. In recent months, Mississippi has transferred 871,950 vaccine doses to Rhode Island, Maine and a nationwide vaccine pool, said Liz Sharlot, spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Health. Maine is among the states in the U.S. with the highest vaccination rates. “In Mississippi, if people don’t understand how important it is to keep alive, we want to protect other Americans,” State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said during a virtual press briefing Friday, speaking about the decision to limit the number of doses accepted. Officials with the state Department of Health review the number of doses made available for Mississippi to order each week and determine whether to order additional doses or send them to the federal pool for other states to use. Mississippi has the lowest vaccination rate in the country, with about 29% of residents fully vaccinated. Just over 930,650 people in the state have received a full series of COVID-19 shots, according to data provided by the state Department of Health.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Police will be barred from enforcing federal gun laws that regulate weapons registration, tracking and possession of firearms by some domestic violence offenders under a bill that Gov. Mike Parson, a former sheriff, said he would sign into law. Passage of what’s dubbed the Second Amendment Preservation Act represents a victory for conservatives who have pushed the legislation for nearly a decade and picked up new momentum this year by responding to the Biden administration’s vows to enact stricter gun control. It’s been met by outrage and alarm from Democrats and gun control advocates, who have slammed the measure as dangerous in a state with such high rates of gun violence. Missouri had the nation’s third-highest per capita rate of gun deaths in 2020. In particular, gun control advocates have focused on what they call the “domestic violence loophole” that the legislation would solidify. Federal law prohibits gun possession for those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors, but when Missouri passed a permitless concealed carry law in 2016, sheriffs were no longer conducting background checks. Under the new bill, that federal limitation is one of many gun laws that would be declared “invalid” in the state. Missouri law only prohibits felons and fugitives from having guns.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a new law allowing the governor to directly nominate judges to fill vacancies – giving Gov. Greg Gianforte and the Republican-controlled Legislature a win in the first of a series of challenges to laws passed by the 2021 Legislature. In a 6-1 ruling Thursday, the court said the Montana Constitution states that judicial vacancies may be filled in a manner provided by law, and the Legislature created a new law. Under the Senate bill that led to the law, the governor can directly nominate qualified candidates to fill judicial vacancies. Previously, the Judicial Nomination Commission vetted applicants and forwarded three to five names to the governor, who appointed a judge using the list. “The Montana Supreme Court reaffirmed what we’ve known to be true: SB 140 is constitutional, and our Constitution gives the legislature the authority to determine how the governor fills a judicial vacancy,” Gianforte said in a statement. “I will appoint judges who will interpret laws, not make them from the bench, and who are committed to the fair, consistent, and objective application of the law.” Justice Laurie McKinnon dissented, saying delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention intended to prevent the direct gubernatorial appointment of judges.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: Shooters and representatives of the firearms industry have again descended upon Grand Island to keep the world safe from zombies. About 265 people took part in the Zombies in the Heartland party this month at Heartland Shooting Park, The Grand Island Independent reports. Participants use weapons to engage with “zombie-themed stages and targets,” said Jeremy Millard of Hornady Manufacturing. By taking aim at targets made of steel and paper, people can live out fantasies derived “from watching ‘The Walking Dead’ or ‘Shaun of the Dead’ or ‘World War Z,’ ” Millard told the newspaper. Some of the steel targets collapse when hit by ammunition. Another target, in the shape of a head, is built around a green clay target, so shooters get the feeling of shooting out a zombie’s brains. Zombies in the Heartland, which began in 2012, is one of only two or three zombie-themed shooting matches in the country, Millard said. Participants use three different guns: a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol. Vendors provide products that are given out as awards “for shooting well or as an incentive to come out and have a good time,” Millard said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State prison officials disclosed Thursday that they want to use a never-before-tried combination of drugs for Nevada’s first lethal injection in 15 years, including the powerful opioid fentanyl, the sedative ketamine and a heart-stopping salt, potassium chloride. Deputy federal public defenders representing convicted murderer Zane Michael Floyd promised courtroom challenges of the plan. A just-completed execution manual provided to a federal judge said a similar-acting drug, alfentanil, might substitute for fentanyl, and potassium acetate might substitute for potassium chloride. In an alternate four-drug procedure, the muscle paralytic cisatracurium would also be used to stop the condemned man’s ability to breathe before he receives the heart-stopping agent. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware II said he may issue a stay of execution ahead of a possible late July death date to allow time to review the choice of drugs and the 65-page execution manual. A state judge in Las Vegas on Monday gave the go-ahead for prosecutors and prison officials to plan Floyd’s execution for the week of July 26.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state now has an official spider, thanks to third graders who went from being afraid of arachnids to promoting them as symbols of the state’s strengths. Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill Friday designating the daring jumping spider as the official state spider of New Hampshire. He was joined by students at Hollis Primary School, who drafted the legislation after a weeklong unit designed to reduce fear of spiders. “I started out with a class yelling, ‘Ewwww,’ and by the end of the week … they were literally waiting in line to hold a little black spider with their bare hands,” teacher Tara Happy told a state House committee in January. Students researched various spiders before settling on the daring jumping spider – formal name Phidippus audax. They emphasized the fuzzy, quarter-sized spider’s winter hardiness, described it as “cute and colorful like New Hampshire’s trees in autumn,” and evoked the state’s “Live Free or Die” motto in recounting how the spiders create “parachutes” to fly to new homes. New Hampshire adopted the white potato as the state’s official vegetable in 2013 at the request of Derry Village Elementary School students. Over the years, similar efforts have led to the adoption of other symbols, including a state poultry (the New Hampshire Red) and state fruit (pumpkin).\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will carry a $10.1 billion surplus – about 25% of the total budget – into the new fiscal year that starts July 1, in a stark turnaround from last year, when Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy sought to borrow almost $10 billion because of a revenue downturn. The $10.1 billion figure is nearly $4 billion higher than the Murphy administration had forecast earlier this year. “Thanks to a remarkable two-month revenue collection surge – an April and May ‘surprise’ like no other – state tax collections in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) are hitting historic highs,” State Treasurer Elizabeth Muoio told lawmakers. The surge in revenue comes just as lawmakers and Murphy face a June 30 deadline to enact a balanced budget. The extra cash confronts lawmakers and the governor with a tantalizing question in an election year: How should they spend the money? The governor will “invest in our public education system, reduce the burden of health care costs, and provide additional tax cuts to New Jersey’s growing middle class,” Murphy’s spokesperson Alyana Alfaro Post said in an email. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Paul Sarlo said he wants to use the funds to pay down state debt, increase the state’s payment for the public pension and make longer-term investments.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Officials at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum have announced plans to build a facility large enough to fill an entire city block. The new 54,000-square-foot museum will be built on the site of a former Safeway grocery store, which is currently occupied by the museum’s Education Center and Prima Title, The Santa Fe New Mexican reports. It is estimated to cost $60 million. The expansion project has been in the works since the museum opened in 1997, but the expansion evolved into relocation in recent years. Museum Director Cody Hartley said the existing museum will become an annex, but officials could later decide not to use the current building. “The organization has grown and grown and grown, and our facility has not kept up,” he said. “This future building will sustain us for years.” Hartley said he hopes to pull demolition permits by the end of the year, with design work taking up most of 2022. Construction is expected to begin shortly after, with a possible opening date in 2024. The museum opened in 1997 with 40 O’Keeffe paintings. It obtained additional paintings in 2006 from the Georgia O’Keeffe Foundation. “This little museum had to prove itself so that museums could trust us with their works,” said Hartley, who joined the museum in 2013 and became its director in 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state cannot require internet providers to offer broadband service for low-income customers for as little as $15 a month starting this week, a federal judge ruled Friday. The low-income broadband consumers law passed in the state budget in April, which was supposed to come into effect Tuesday. It allowed the state’s attorney general to issue penalties up to $1,000 per violation from providers. USTelecom, CTIA, the New York State Telecommunications Association and other industry groups representing internet providers had sued in April, arguing that the law meant they could either face penalties for not complying or be forced to provide the services “at a loss.” U.S. District Court Senior District Judge Denis R. Hurley, of the Eastern District of New York, said in a preliminary injunction that “the internet’s promise of access” hinges on whether people can afford it. But the judge said the internet providers have shown that they could suffer “imminent irreparable injury” because of the law’s potential impact on their bottom line. Three of the internet companies told the court that the law would reduce annual net income by at least $1 million each. “While a telecommunications giant like Verizon may be able to absorb such a loss, others may not,” the judge wrote.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The constitutional right of children to have access to a good public school education also applies to individual students who aren’t getting help to stop classroom bullying and harassment against them, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. The justices’ unanimous ruling in part addresses the declaration in a landmark 1997 ruling by the court that the combination of two portions of the state constitution guarantees every child of this state an “opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools.” That and another 2004 ruling in what’s known as the “Leandro” case created the basis for a separate public policy debate over how to address inequitable school funding and services not considered in Friday’s opinion. But the right to that opportunity also must be offered as grounds for reasonable legal claims by individual students who say that their rights were violated and that there is no other way to seek redress, Chief Justice Paul Newby wrote. “The right to a sound basic education rings hollow if the structural right exists but in a setting that is so intimidating and threatening to students that they lack a meaningful opportunity to learn,” Newby said in the opinion, which reverses a ruling by the state Court of Appeals to dismiss the case.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican legislative leaders are in no hurry to spend an additional $1 billion in federal coronavirus aid, despite grumbling from some lawmakers that the funds should be distributed sooner rather than later. Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner and Ray Holmberg, who heads the powerful Senate appropriations committee, say they’re awaiting federal guidance on how the money can be used. The federal funds were transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota this month and represent the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history, state Treasurer Thomas Beadle said. Other massive deposits, including the previous appropriation of $1.25 billion in coronavirus aid last year, were made in increments, Beadle said. The latest deposit is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest, he said. North Dakota’s share of the federal funds is part of a pandemic relief package signed by President Joe Biden that includes $350 billion for state and local governments. Around the Capitol, some members of the GOP-led Legislature jokingly refer to the aid as “Biden Bucks.” Some lawmakers have been pushing to identify projects and begin doling the money out, Wardner said. “I don’t know why there is such a hurry,” he said. “How can we spend it when we’re not sure what the rules are?”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The City Council on Monday is expected to vote on legislation that would pay residents $100 each for getting their COVID-19 vaccines, an incentive that members hope will spur more to get the jab. Only those who receive their vaccines after Monday will be eligible, and they must be Columbus residents. There are no income restrictions, but only $275,000 is available for payments, which means a total of 2,750 people will be able to get the money. Council President Pro-Tem Elizabeth Brown said the Vaccine Green program is an extension of the Right to Recover program the City Council adopted in 2020. In that program, approved in October, the council approved $1.21 million in federal coronavirus relief for low-wage workers who needed to take time off to recover from COVID-19. Many low-wage workers don’t receive sick pay. Through March, more than 80% of the recipients were people of color, Brown said. That program was administered by the Columbus Urban League and Catholic Social Services, and the vaccine incentive program will also be administered by the Urban League, Brown said. A website will go live for residents to register once City Council approves the legislation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission announced Thursday that it is expanding the eligibility for cash incentives to those who leave unemployment rolls and return to work. Anyone working two part-time jobs totaling 32 or more hours per week will qualify for the $1,200 stipend, the OESC said. The incentive announced in May by Gov. Kevin Stitt was to be available only to those working full time for 32 or more hours weekly. The OESC is offering virtual job fairs through the end of June and will host in-person job fairs in Tulsa on June 23 and Oklahoma City on June 25, according to Director Shelley Zumwalt. “The agency is continuing to focus on providing benefits to those in need, while also focusing on connecting job-seekers with employment opportunities through our reemployment services and upcoming career fairs,” Zumwalt said. Stitt announced the program last month, along with a June 26 end to $300-a-week supplemental unemployment benefits to push workers back to employers who have said that some jobless workers were paid more in benefits than they would have received in wages.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As the state nears its vaccination target to reopen the economy, Gov. Kate Brown announced Friday that she is extending the state’s mortgage foreclosure moratorium through September. However, the governor was unable to extend the state’s eviction moratorium, which began in April 2020 as tenants financially struggled during the pandemic. That is set to expire at the end of June. “This means that renters must pay their July rent, or their landlords can evict them for nonpayment,” Brown said. Last month, the Democratic governor signed a bill that reinstated Oregon’s moratorium on foreclosures, which allow homeowners to put their mortgage in forbearance at least through June 30. The law also gave Brown the authority to extend the end date, which she announced she was doing Friday. “This is vital protection that the Legislature has provided to Oregon’s homeowners as we continue to rebound from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” Brown said. However, the governor was unable to extend state’s rent moratorium. Brown urged those who will struggle to pay rent in July apply for rental assistance. Brown is working with lawmakers to pass a bill that would give tenants who apply for rental assistance “safe harbor from eviction.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday signed legislation to extend hundreds of waivers of regulations that his administration approved over the past 15 months under the authority of his pandemic disaster emergency declaration that lawmakers voted to end. The bill allows the waivers to last through Sept. 30, unless Wolf’s administration ends them sooner. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the bill unanimously, at Wolf’s urging, as a companion to the Republican-penned resolution to end the disaster emergency declaration that passed nearly along partisan lines. Republicans characterized their move to end the declaration as carrying out the will of the people in last month’s statewide referendum, in which voters approved a GOP-backed constitutional amendment to give lawmakers broad new power over extending and ending disaster emergencies. The suspended regulations cover a wide swath of government requirements, including licensing, inspections and training. The Wolf administration maintains that dissolving the disaster emergency does not affect a health secretary’s disease-prevention authority to issue mask-wearing and stay-at-home orders or to shut down schools and nonessential businesses. Wolf, in any case, has ended those measures as vaccinations rise.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Residents are being encouraged to get out and go for a walk. The RIWalks Challenge, coordinated by the Rhode Island Land Trust, is designed to entice people to get outside and explore nature while enjoying land trust trails, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve health. Thirty different woodland “creatures” have been installed on trails around the state. The creatures are inspired by the plant life found in nature, the trust announced in a statement. Each has a QR code to snap to get more information about the creature. Executive Director Rupert Friday said he hopes people share a photo on social media and inspire others. A newly designed website, riwalks.org/challenge.php, will help walkers track the creatures they find. “Our goal in the design was to elicit a sense of wonder, surprise, and mystery,” Greg Rebis, who designed the creatures, said in a statement. “The resulting designs are whimsical characters – an anthropomorphization that dances between fantasy and reality – to appeal to the imagination and let people relate to our native flora while out in nature.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster’s decision to end the COVID-19 state of emergency in South Carolina means it’s back to being illegal to buy beer or wine outside a store. During the pandemic, McMaster’s emergency order allowed grocery and other stores to deliver beer and wine to people picking up their purchases in a parking lot or a drive-thru window. Lawmakers tried to pass bills changing the law permanently, but proposals couldn’t get through both the House and Senate this session. So when McMaster let his final of 30 state-of-emergency declarations expire June 6, curbside beer and wine delivery went with it. But the ban may just last a few weeks. The House put into its budget plan a temporary renewal so that people would not have to go inside a store to get beer and wine. If a conference committee agrees, then curbside delivery could return when the new budget begins July 1.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBaltic: The next mayor could be decided by the drawing of lots after an election officially ended in a tie. Election officials from the southeastern South Dakota city, which has a population of just over 1,000, said their canvas of votes Thursday confirmed that the two mayoral candidates – Deborah McIsaac and Tracy Peterson – were tied with 117 votes apiece. The Dell Rapids Tribune reports that if the election remains tied after a potential recount, state law calls for the election to be decided by “a drawing of lots.” The candidates have until the end of the day Thursday to initiate a recount. But if they don’t request the recount or if the vote count remains tied, City Administrator Rebecca Wulf would then meet with the candidates to decide the election in a game of chance. “It’s pretty incredible,” Wulf said. “When they flipped the last vote over, and it was a tie, I just sat on the ground and said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ ”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations voted Wednesday to begin a comprehensive study of litter pollution in the state. The Tennessee Wildlife Federation, which advocated for the study, said in a news release that $15 million in taxpayer money is spent to clean up litter each year. In spite of that effort, the Tennessee River contains more microplastics per gallon than any other studied river in the world, according to the group. Other impacts to the economy include negative tourist perception and $60 million a year in agricultural damage, according to the group. The new study will include the sources and composition of litter, financial and environmental costs, and the economic opportunities of recovering waste. “If we want to see reductions in litter pollution, we need a comprehensive and statewide approach,” Wildlife Federation CEO Michael Butler said in a news release. “Our water, wildlife and wild places are drowning in litter.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has offered no details on his plans to construct new barriers along the border with Mexico while also launching an aggressive campaign to arrest migrants – moves that set up another clash with the Biden administration over immigration. Abbott did not say how much new barrier Texas would erect, where it would be installed along the state’s 1,200 miles of international border or what it would look like when he made the announcement Thursday in a room full of sheriffs in the border city of Del Rio. He promised more would be revealed this week. A top official in one of Texas’ largest border counties, Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez, said Friday that he sees the goal as putting in place new barriers that would give state troopers grounds to arrest migrants who go around or damage it – and then put them in jail for six months. “I understand why he wants to do it. It’s a tool that gets him to a Class B misdemeanor,” Cortez said. He was skeptical of whether jail would deter migrants who travel hundreds of miles and risk death to get to the U.S. Legal experts said the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the power to enforce immigration law is in the hands of the federal government, including striking down efforts by Arizona Republicans a decade ago.\n\nUtah\n\nBryce Canyon National Park: Dozens gathered to look up at the stars rather than down to the hoodoos in recent days at the park’s annual astronomy festival. For more than 50 years, Bryce Canyon has held ranger-led astronomy programs, though the park only gained its International Dark Sky designation in 2019. This year’s celebration was the first Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival held since the designation, as last year’s event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also marked a return to large events after the pandemic for all Utah national parks, though Bryce Canyon has held some events with COVID-19 restrictions through the past year. “There’s no place quite like Bryce Canyon by day, and no time like a new moon in June to enjoy it by night,” a press release said. Day programs included family-friendly arts and crafts with opportunities to make sundials and paper constellations and to contribute artwork unveiled Saturday. At twilight, park rangers held presentations at the Sunrise Point Amphitheater exploring space, covering everything from planets to black holes to birds. “We want to, for what we are doing here at this park, encourage stewardship of our night skies,” Ranger Ben Taylor said in his evening program entitled “Looking Back at Bryce, Looking Back at Home.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is seeing a large infestation of gypsy moth caterpillars this year that are defoliating trees, the Agency of Agriculture said. Vermont has not seen a large outbreak since 1991, but the insects have been present in smaller numbers. Gypsy moths are invasive insects that first arrived in the United States more than 100 years ago, and they have been expanding their range ever since. The moths prefer oak trees, but when populations are high, they will eat many types of leaves, including maple and pine. Although gypsy moth caterpillars are damaging, otherwise healthy trees can often survive a few years of successive defoliation. At the time of the last major outbreak, a fungus significantly decreased the gypsy moth population. The fungus is most abundant after periods of wet weather, but due to the droughts and dry weather the state has experienced over the past few years, the fungus has been limited. Due to this combination of drought and defoliation, Vermont may see another year or two of high levels of gypsy moth activity unless the state sees some rainy seasons to increase the population of the gypsy moth-killing fungus.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Singer Pharrell Williams’ nonprofit plans to open a group of small private schools for students from low-income families, starting in Norfolk. The first school will open this fall in the Ghent neighborhood for students in the city in grades three through five, with the goal of expanding on the equity-focused nonprofit’s decade of experience running summer programs for students, The Virginian-Pilot reports. “If the system is fixed and unfair, then it needs to be broken,” Williams said in a news release. “We don’t want lockstep learning where so many kids fall behind; we want bespoke learning designed for each child, where the things that make a child different are the same things that will make a child rise up and take flight.” Called Yellowhab, yellow after Williams’ nonprofit and “hab” after the name of the Mars habitat in the movie “The Martian,” the school will be tuition-free for at least the first year. The costs of attendance will be covered by philanthropic support. Williams’ nonprofit has offered summer programs and other educational opportunities throughout Hampton Roads for years but settled on Norfolk for the site of the first school because of its deeply entrenched housing segregation and the city’s plans to redevelop three public housing communities through its billion-dollar St. Paul’s redevelopment.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Gonzaga University is joining the list of schools that will require students to prove they are vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to participate in campus activities this fall. Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh made the announcement Thursday in a message to the university community, The Spokesman-Review reports. The requirement includes students in programs split between in-person and online activities but not those in graduate programs offered exclusively online. Exemptions will be permitted for medical and religious reasons. As far as personal or philosophical objections, McCulloh said the university “cannot determine how those would be evaluated, and so (we) are not including them.” McCulloh said he expects the university’s COVID-19 vaccination reporting website to be online later this month. Gonzaga is only requiring staff to attest whether they are vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, McCulloh said, with the policy based on a directive from the state Department of Labor and Industries. “The virus is a known hazard,” he said. “Our obligation is to do everything we can to keep people safe.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Greenbrier River Trail has been designated as a national recreation trail, federal officials said. The trail adds more 78 miles to the National Trails System, a network of more than 1,300 existing trails across the U.S., a statement from the Interior Department said. “As COVID-19 vaccination rates increase and our nation takes a collective and cautious sigh of relief, we need recreational resources now more than ever to strengthen physical, social and mental health across our country,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said. The Greenbrier River Trail is a former railroad that’s now used for hiking, biking and horseback riding. The longest trail of its kind in West Virginia, it goes through several small towns and some of the state’s most remote areas, and it includes 35 bridges and two tunnels. “The addition of the Greenbrier River Trail to our National Trails System is fantastic news for our entire state,” U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-Va., said in a statement. “These and all of the other magnificent parks and trails within our borders truly connect our communities and create endless opportunities for both residents and visitors alike while also contributing to local economies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that local health departments do not have the authority to close schools due to emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic, delivering a win to private and religious schools that challenged a Dane County order. The conservative majority of the court, in a 4-3 decision, also ruled that a school closure order issued last year by Public Health Madison & Dane County infringed on constitutional religious rights. The ruling is another victory for conservatives who challenged state and local orders issued during the pandemic to close businesses and schools; limit capacity in bars, restaurants and other buildings; and require masks to be worn. All of those restrictions have either expired or been rescinded by courts. Friday’s ruling will have no immediate impact because the 2020-21 school year has ended, but it will limit the powers of health departments in the future by preventing them from ordering school closures. Dane County Health Director Janel Heinrich said the ruling “hinders the ability of local health officers in Wisconsin to prevent and contain public health threats for decades to come.”\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park recorded its busiest May ever as tourism continued to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. The park had more than 483,000 recreational visits last month, up 11% from May 2019, park officials said Friday. So far, Yellowstone is seeing its busiest year in recent memory. The park recorded more than 658,000 visits from January through May, the most since 594,000 visits during that time in 2016. Usually the park opens to vehicles between mid-April and mid-May, but last year ir was closed from late March through most of May because of the pandemic. The park’s two Wyoming entrances opened for the summer season May 18, and its three Montana entrances opened June 1. Tourism rebounded, and the park posted its second-busiest August and busiest September and October on record. The park finished 2020 with 3.8 million recreational visits, down 5% from 2019.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/14"}]}
