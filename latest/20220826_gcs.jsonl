Now, they are struggling to find a place to live weeks before classes start, according to a survey from Realtor.com, a digital real estate site.\n\nThe survey was conducted from July 12 to July 17, with over 500 current and recent college graduates participating. Thirty-five percent said they cannot afford to rent an apartment in their college town and 19% are relying on parental help to pay rent, something they didn’t need to do last year.\n\nForty-four percent said the overall real estate market is to blame.\n\nKayla Krueger, 19, is a college student at the University of Oregon in Eugene and struggled to find housing for the upcoming school year.\n\n\"We wanted to try to find a house to live in,\" she said. \"Apartments are often expensive and offer a bunch of extra amenities we don't really need.\"\n\n► Retail help:Walmart, the country's largest private employer, to pay 100% of college tuition for employees\n\n► 'I quit': Workers change jobs at a record pace amid burnout, new openings with higher pay\n\nIn June this year, there's an 8.1% rent increase from last year, with median rent hitting $1,575 in the 50 largest metro areas. In 44 of the 50 largest markets, rent prices in June reached a record-breaking high and, on average, people are paying almost $150 more a month.\n\nWhat's COVID's impact on real estate?\n\nHousing prices increased during the pandemic, leaving many prospective homebuyers looking for rental properties instead, resulting in higher median rent, says Realtor.com economist George Ratiu. The pandemic has spurred retirees and remote workers to move to more attractive areas, he adds, making it even more challenging for college students.\n\n\"With Americans embracing a return toward a new normal, businesses reopening, and pandemic restrictions lifting, demand for rental properties is rising,\" Ratiu told USA TODAY. \"Many college towns have become highly attractive destinations to both retirees looking for quality of life, and young families looking for affordability and good schools, further adding to demand.\"\n\nThe rent increases are only one of the factors behind the inability of many students to secure a place for the fall.\n\nThirty percent of students delayed confirming fall housing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many weren’t sure whether they would have in-person classes or spend another year at Zoom university. The long wait cost about 22% of students a slot in on-campus housing, and 30% said securing housing was harder this year than last year.\n\n\"It was a stressful process because people were already starting to look for housing back in January,\" Krueger said. \"I wanted a house from the beginning, and I always pictured myself living in one, but since I got a late start, I dismissed my desires.\"\n\nKreuger and her five roommates began searching at the beginning of February and by the end of the month, they were approved for a seven-bedroom house. Luckily, it is only a 15-minute walk from campus and the rent is around $700 a month per person.\n\nThey wanted to sign a lease as soon as possible to ensure fall housing and will be able to move on Aug. 1.\n\nRents expected to keep rising\n\nOther students are having to make adjustments for the upcoming school year because of financial challenges. Twenty-one percent will be moving back home to save money, while 13% will take on more roommates and 10% will lower their wants and needs to save money.\n\nWhile rents are expected to keep rising over the next few months, Ratiu says the rate is likely to moderate as new single and multi-family homes are built. But for right now, there are few options for college students and solutions depend on each student's situation.\n\n\"If they can take a part-time job to pay for housing, or if they can move in with family to save on housing costs, it may be worth pursuing those to avoid piling on debt,\" Ratiu said.\n\n► Homes hard to find:Home sales to foreign buyers drop to the lowest level in a decade amid COVID\n\n► Got a car lease?: Your vehicle could be worth thousands of dollars more than expected because of COVID", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/us/five-things-february-28-trnd/index", "title": "5 things to know for February 28: Ukraine, EPA, Covid-19, State of ..."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/us/five-things-august-23-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 23: Ukraine, Primaries, Student loans ...", "text": "If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Ukraine\n\nThe US government is urging Americans in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The renewed US warning follows similar announcements from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials that Moscow may carry out intense attacks, including missile strikes, to coincide with Ukraine's Independence Day on Wednesday. In some areas of Ukraine, officials have issued a ban on all large gatherings between Monday and Thursday. Meanwhile, discussions are ongoing to try to secure the release of Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan from Russia, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday, adding that officials are working \"with the utmost urgency.\"\n\n2.

Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide. For many of those women, employers' benefit packages may be the only way they can soon afford a legal abortion.\n\nAmazon became the latest corporation to cover employees' travel costs to seek abortion care. The company told staff it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the nature of the Reuters report to CNN Business.\n\nThe company's announcement echoes similar moves by Citigroup, Yelp, Uber and Lyft to help employees bypass Republican-led efforts in several states to effectively ban abortion. And it comes just hours after a bombshell report by Politico indicated the Supreme Court is prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCNN has not independently confirmed the Politico report, and a Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIf Roe is overturned, legislatures in 26 states have pending laws indicating that they intend to ban abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. That could leave many women in need of abortion services hundreds or thousands of miles away from access to the procedure — unaffordable for many.\n\nCorporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent and worry about the impact these states' anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.\n\nExecutives are also learning how difficult it can be to craft a political message without angering one side or the other. Disney, notably, is grappling with the political fallout of coming out against Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay law. CEO Bob Chapek initially failed to condemn the legislation before backtracking and apologizing to staff and fans who were outraged by the legislation. After Disney publicly opposed the law and vowed to help repeal it, lawmakers in the state passed legislation to dissolve the company's longstanding status as a self-governing special district.\n\nLast year, as several states pushed legislation that would make it harder for some citizens to vote, hundreds of leading executives from companies including Amazon, Google, BlackRock and Starbucks signed a statement opposing the bills.\n\nHere are some of the most prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe nation's second-largest private employer said it would cover up to $4,000 per year in travel expenses for staff members seeking non-life-threatening medical care, including abortions, if care isn't available within 100 miles of where they live.\n\nTesla\n\nThe electric vehicle maker said in its 2021 impact report that it will help provide travel and lodging \"for those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state\" as part of its expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering. Tesla's headquarters moved to Texas in 2021, a state that has banned abortions after six weeks.\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup in March became one of the largest US companies to commit to covering employees' travel costs if they need to leave their state to seek an abortion.\n\n\"In response to changes in reproductive healthcare laws in certain states in the US, beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,\" Citi said in a letter to shareholders as part of its annual proxy statement.\n\nBumble\n\nThe dating app company, which is based in Austin, Texas, in September created a fund \"supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in Texas.\"\n\n\"Bumble is women-founded and women-led, and from day one we've stood up for the most vulnerable. We'll keep fighting against regressive laws like #SB8,\" the company said on Twitter the week the legislation, which amounts to a near total ban on abortions in the state , went into effect last fall.\n\nRelief funds will go to organizations that support women's reproductive rights, including Fund Texas Choice, according to Bumble.\n\nLevi Strauss\n\nThe clothing company called protecting access to reproductive care a critical business issue.\n\n\"Efforts to further restrict or criminalize that access would have far-reaching consequences for the American workforce,\" the company told CNN Business in a statement. \"Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees. That means protecting reproductive rights.\"\n\nUnder Levi's benefits plan, employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren't included in the company's benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement, it said.\n\nLyft & Uber\n\nThe ride-sharing rivals each announced in September that they would create legal defense funds to protect any drivers who might be sued under the Texas law for driving a person who receives an abortion.\n\nThe law's wording leaves open the possibility that a driver could be sued, possibly even if they didn't know an abortion was happening, according to Elizabeth Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nLyft also said it would donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood \"to ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.\"\n\nMatch Group\n\nThe Dallas-based company that owns Match.com and several dating apps including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge, also announced in September a fund to ensure its employees and their dependents would be able to seek reproductive care outside of Texas.\n\n\"The company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business,\" said CEO Shar Dubey in a memo at the time. \"But in this instance, I personally, as a woman in Texas, could not keep silent.\"\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce announced in September that it would assist its employees and their families if they want to leave Texas after the state passed the nation's most restrictive abortion law.\n\nThe cloud computing company told its 56,000 employees that they \"stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.\"\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff tweeted at the time: \"Ohana if you want to move we'll help you exit TX. Your choice.\" (\"Ohana\" is the Hawaiian word for \"family.\")\n\nYelp\n\nA representative for the San Francisco-based company said its employee health insurance already covers abortion care, but starting in May, Yelp will cover travel expenses for any US employees and their dependents who need to travel out of state to access abortion care.\n\nThe benefit extends to staff and dependents affected by any current or future restrictions on reproductive rights.\n\nAs a remote-first company with a distributed workforce, \"it's a priority for us to offer our employees consistent healthcare coverage, regardless of where they live,\" a representative said.\n\nStarbucks\n\nStarbucks' healthcare plan is offering reimbursement for travel for abortion or gender-affirming procedures when those are not available within 100 miles of an employee's home. Dependents who use Starbucks' medical plan are also eligible for these benefits.\n\n\"Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,\" wrote Sara Kelly, acting EVP of Partner Resources at the company, in a May 16 letter.\n\nKelly added that the company's benefits team is working on details of the new benefit, including timing.\n\n— CNN Business' Catherine Thorbecke, Ramishah Maruf, Charles Riley and David Goldman contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/tech/instacart-shoppers-batches-pandemic/index.html", "title": "Instacart desperately needed them months ago. Now some workers ...", "text": "(CNN Business) In the early days of the pandemic, as households around the country went into lockdown, shoppers for Instacart had a seemingly limitless amount of grocery orders to fulfill. Their earnings were, at times, bolstered significantly by generous tips in recognition of the personal health risk workers were taking.\n\nBut in recent weeks, some shoppers in markets across the country said they have gone hours or even days at a time without seeing many — or any — \"batches,\" which can consist of one or a few orders from different customers, according to social media posts and conversations with five shoppers, each of whom joined the platform during the pandemic. The workers, who spoke with CNN Business on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, are now grappling with the sudden drop in orders surfaced to them and struggling to understand the reasons behind it without more information from the company.\n\n\"You're basically just wasting your time,\" said one worker, who shops in Atlanta. He said he recently sat for two hours outside the two major grocery stores he typically shops near his home without seeing a single order.\n\nThe shoppers CNN Business spoke to said they believed the timing of the slowdown corresponded with a recent company app update. Instacart notified workers late last month that it was rolling out a change over \"the next few weeks\" so that \"batches you see will be closer to your location\" and warned that this \"will result in you seeing less batches in the list view,\" according to an email viewed by CNN Business. The company said in the email that the goal of the change is to help shoppers \"choose batches that are more relevant to you without having to travel too far for a batch.\"\n\nBut the underlying cause appears to be more fundamental: a shift in demand. An Instacart spokesperson told CNN Business there isn't a technical issue but rather the marketplace is stabilizing following what the company said was the busiest holiday season in its history atop a surge in Covid cases from the Omicron variant, which is now easing in the United States.\n\nRead More", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/08/state-cheese-awol-animals-editor-jailed-news-around-states/117415210/", "title": "State cheese, AWOL animals: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Legislative leaders are continuing to discuss prison construction and renovation alternatives, including whether pandemic relief funds can be used to offset costs or renovating and building prisons. Key lawmakers say they expect to continue discussions this month in advance of a possible special session later in the year. “I think the House and Senate are pretty close to an agreement,” said Rep. Steve Clouse, who chairs the House General Fund budget committee. “The vast majority of legislators want to move forward with a bond proposal and for us to own the prisons.” Clouse and Sen. Greg Albritton, chairman of the Senate General Fund budget committee, said a topic under discussion is whether federal funds from the American Rescue Plan may be used to offset some of the costs or do renovations. States can use that money for a wide range of uses to contend with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Albritton said the state is trying to get clarity on “what can we do with the recovery money.” Lawmakers are looking for more options after Gov. Kay Ivey’s plan to rent prisons, which would be run by the state but built and owned by private companies, fell apart because of financing concerns. However, federal officials have been clear that new facilities will not solve the state’s prison woes.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A wildfire burned close to a vacation destination Tuesday, but fire officials believed Chena Hot Springs Resort would be spared. “They’re pretty confident that they’re going to be able to defend the resort, based on the measures that we’ve set up and the personnel we have on scene,” said Tim Mowry, a spokesperson for the Alaska Division of Forestry. Firefighters were working to protect the resort, homes and recreational cabins in the area of interior Alaska about 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks. Flames were about 100 yards from the resort, where crews were spraying water on buildings, the agency said in a statement. Firefighters also conducted a back burn near a trail that leads to two yurts for viewing the northern lights in hopes it would help stop the fire from advancing toward the main buildings. Hoses and sprinklers also were set up at nearby homes and cabins. No structures in the Chena Hot Springs area had burned, fire officials said. Light showers that fell overnight weren’t enough to put out the fire, but the increased humidity was helping to slow its growth. The Fairbanks North Star Borough on Monday issued a voluntary evacuation order. Alaska State Troopers conducted a survey of homeowners and cabin users and found that about 30 people decided not to leave, along with resort owner Bernie Karl.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials in the city plan to ignore Arizona’s new “Second Amendment sanctuary” law that bars state and local governments from enforcing certain federal gun regulations, possibly setting up a court fight as a growing number of cities and counties in the United States declare themselves similar firearm havens. The move by Democratic Mayor Regina Romero and the City Council again puts Tucson and the Republican-led state at odds over how to regulate gun sales and use. The southern Arizona city has long tried to enforce gun laws stricter than the state’s, including mandating background checks for guns purchased on city property and destroying seized firearms. Over the years, those measures have been challenged after the Republican-controlled Legislature enacted laws barring the actions. The new action came after GOP Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill in April declaring that Arizona is a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary. It was partly a response to the election of President Joe Biden, who has vowed to enact tighter firearms regulations. In a growing movement, at least 1,200 local governments have declared themselves sanctuaries insulated from state and federal gun laws since 2018, when high-profile mass shootings prompted calls for stronger regulations. Many are symbolic, but some carry legal force.\n\nArkansas\n\nBeebe: The Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys for George Floyd’s family on Tuesday mourned a white Arkansas teenager fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy, as they urged support across racial lines for efforts to reform police practices. Sharpton eulogized 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, who was shot and killed by a white Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy, Sgt. Michael Davis, during a traffic stop June 23 near Cabot, about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. The killing in the predominantly white community has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists such as Sharpton, who said concerns about police tactics aren’t just limited to the Black community. “The issue of policing is not about Black and white,” Sharpton told a packed auditorium at Beebe High School, where Brittain was a rising senior. “It’s about right and wrong.” Many attending the memorial wore jeans and shirts that read “Justice for Hunter.” Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week fired Davis for not turning on his body camera until after he had shot Brittain. Staley said the only footage police have is from the aftermath. Arkansas State Police are investigating Brittain’s death. Authorities have released few details about the shooting. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and was holding a jug of antifreeze when he was shot.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers will wait until next year to continue considering a bill that would give opioid users a place to inject drugs in supervised settings, the bill’s author said Tuesday. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said he was told the Assembly Health Committee will delay a hearing on his bill until January. The measure would allow Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles County to start programs giving people a place to inject drugs while trained staff are available to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. “Safe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and help people into recovery,” Wiener said. Currently the sites are illegal in the United States but legal in Canada. Wiener’s bill barely cleared the Senate in April. The Senate Republican Caucus said in a statement at the time that the bill would “establish taxpayer-staffed and funded drug dens.” The proposal is opposed by some law enforcement groups, but Wiener said in a statement that it “is very much alive, albeit delayed.” Wiener noted he was disappointed in another delay at a time when he said San Francisco and other cities are experiencing record overdose deaths. His bill would require workers at the centers to try to get users into drug treatment programs or refer them to medical or mental health care or social services programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo will begin vaccinating some of its animals against COVID-19 as early as next week. Zoologists say they have been working with the veterinary vaccine company Zoetis to receive doses for the animals, and primates and carnivores will be first on the list. The veterinary vaccine, which is formulated primarily for mammals, is being developed separate from the ones for human use. Transmission is rare between humans and other species, but there have been several documented cases of COVID-19 in large cats, monkeys and certain rodent populations. “We know some of those animals – like gorillas and tigers, mink, otters – can all be infected. But for a lot of these others, we don’t know what the susceptibility is,” Dr. Scott Larsen, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, told KMGH-TV. “For animals, we want to be able to protect them similar to (how) we’re trying to protect people.” Veterinary scientists do not think common house pets like cats or dogs are in significant danger of catching COVID-19. “There are 85 million dogs in the United States and 90 million cats,” said Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary in Denver. “If we were going to see problems … I think we would be seeing it.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGuilford: The state’s newest climate change legislation should put it in a good position to receive millions of dollars in anticipated federal funds to help foot the bill for expensive resiliency projects needed across Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials said Tuesday. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said the $30 million in bonding included in the new state budget to help municipalities identify and plan for such projects, including green infrastructure, will also give Connecticut a leg up on other states. “We’ll be shovel-ready. We’ll be at the front of the line,” Dykes said during a bill-signing event at a beach in Guilford. “It’s going to take a lot of dollars to help protect our communities from the impacts of climate change. And the best way to do that, dollars we really want to put to work, are federal dollars.” Curt Johnson, president of the environmental group Save the Sound, predicted Connecticut will receive $3 or $4 in federal funds for every $1 the state spends on these resiliency efforts. The new law gives all cities and towns, not just certain ones, the ability to establish stormwater authorities. Additionally, the law expands the duties of the 10-year-old Connecticut Green Bank, a first-in-the-nation entity.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Two deadly species of hemlock have been found in Delaware, and the state’s Department of Agriculture is warning people to avoid plants that look like wild carrots to prevent the possibility of being poisoned. Environmental scientists confirmed that poison hemlock and spotted water hemlock were located in Sussex County wetlands, according to a news release from the agency. Both plants have small white flowers and bloom between June and August. Poison hemlock also grows in meadows, pastures and ditches. The invasive plant can reach between 6 and 8 feet tall and has a hairless stem with purple blotches. The department said this type of hemlock releases an odor but shouldn’t be crushed to smell because toxic oils can be emitted. Spotted water hemlock is a native plant and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Its stems vary in color from solid green or purple to green with purple spots or stripes, and it has fern-like leaves. People who think they found either plant can email pictures to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification. The Agriculture Department said residents shouldn’t try to eradicate the hemlocks themselves and should instead find a licensed aquatic pest control company to treat them. It also advised against mowing the plants, which can release toxic particles into the air.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Parking in the nation’s capital is often a nightmare for residents and especially for their guests, but D.C. has launched an easier visitor parking pass program, WUSA-TV reports. When the visitor parking pass was launched in 2013, it was met with widespread opposition. With the new program, people can register for the annual pass allowing their guests to park for two hours in a residential permit parking zone in all eight wards. “The intent of the system is to make getting a visitor parking permit easier and also to reduce parking congestion in residential areas,” said Everett Lott, acting director for the District Department of Transportation. The new online parking portal now allows people to print out their own parking permits for visitors and can be accessed through the portal provided by D.C. online or through an app on Apple or Android phones. “This particular system, the automated system, is connected to the resident and to the license plate,” Lott said. “So it makes it a lot more user-friendly but also helps to eliminate any of the abuse that was possible in the past.” Parking permits, which must be displayed prominently on the windshield of vehicles, can be printed at home, at D.C. Public Library branches, or at kiosks at DDOT Headquarters, the DDOT Permit Office and Metropolitan Police Department precincts.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A couple is suing a Catholic school and demanding the return of a large donation, saying it isn’t adhering to Catholic values because of the way it’s handling issues like race and accepting the LGBTQ community. Anthony and Barbara Scarpo filed their lawsuit against the Academy of the Holy Names last month after one of their daughters graduated and a second transferred to another school, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The lawsuit comes four years after the couple pledged $1.35 million to the school, which named its theater for the family. The couple claims the school has “lost its way” by distancing itself from mainstream Catholicism and embracing a “woke culture” in which priority is given to “gender identity, human sexuality and pregnancy termination among other hot button issues.” The suit also takes issue with a blackboard in a common area that explains how to be an ally to the LGBTQ community, as well as how the school takes on the issue of race, saying white students are made to feel guilty. The Scarpos had paid $240,000 toward the pledge as of 2018, the lawsuit said. The school didn’t discuss details of the suit, but spokeswoman Emily Wise told the Times in an email that the school’s curriculum is based on Catholic values.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Wednesday declined to block some challenged sections of Georgia’s new election law ahead of two runoff elections next week, but he didn’t rule out the possibility for future elections. Election integrity activists had asked U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee to prohibit the state from enforcing sections of the new law that have to do with observation of elections, as well as a new deadline for requesting absentee ballots. Their request arose from one of eight federal lawsuits challenging the new law. The Republican-backed overhaul of election rules enacted this year has been blasted by Democrats and others who say it creates unnecessary obstacles to voting, particularly for people of color. Most of the lawsuits, including one filed last month by the U.S. Department of Justice, challenge the parts of law that critics say threaten voting rights. The targeted request that led to Wednesday’s ruling, though, focused on provisions mostly related to monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The activists, led by the Coalition for Good Governance, said those sections criminalize normal election observation activities and could intimidate voters, election observers and members of the news media. A tighter absentee ballot request deadline makes it virtually impossible to get one for a runoff, they argue.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers on Tuesday overrode Gov. David Ige’s veto of a bill that overhauls how the state funds the Hawaii Tourism Authority and allocates tourism tax revenue to the counties. The bill would stop funding the tourism agency with money raised by the transient accommodations tax on hotel stays and other short-term rentals. Instead, lawmakers intend to pay for the agency with money from the general fund, though for the current fiscal year they appropriated federal coronavirus relief funds. Further, instead of providing the state’s four major counties with a share of transient accommodations tax revenue, the legislation gives the counties the authority to levy their own surcharge to the tax. Currently, the state charges one uniform hotel tax rate across the islands. Sen. Bennette Misalucha, vice chair of the Senate’s Energy, Economic Development, and Tourism Committee, said special funds shouldn’t be protected for the benefit of one industry. She said the Legislature brought special funds like hotel tax revenue into the general fund to stop this practice. The Hawaii Tourism Authority will now be required to get support from lawmakers for its budget just like other state agencies, she said, which will require the agency to be more forthcoming with its strategic plans and force more communication between the agency and lawmakers.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: High housing prices in northern Idaho are making it difficult to attract police officers, law enforcement officials say. Coeur d’Alene Police Capt. Dave Hagar told the Coeur d’Alene Press that low crime rates and an outdoor lifestyle are big draws but that skyrocketing housing prices are turning people away. “Five years ago, the cost of living in Coeur d’Alene was much more reasonable,” Hagar said. “Now it’s gone above that.” The Coeur d’Alene Association of Realtors said the median residential home sale price was $476,000 in March. That’s a 47% increase from a year ago. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said his agency has recruited new hires only to have them decline the job after discovering they couldn’t afford housing. “It’s a significant barrier,” he said. “The housing situation is severe.” The agency is looking to hire deputies, dispatchers, control room operators, clerks and jail staff. “We’re going to have to attract local candidates,” Norris said. “We can’t do that when some of our pay is $14 or $15 an hour.” Kootenai County Commissioner Bill Brooks said other county agencies are also having a hard time finding and retaining workers. Wages once considered normal are now not enough.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s schools will encourage student COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the start of the school year with school-based vaccination sites and events, officials announced Wednesday. Officials with the nation’s third-largest school district plan to offer full in-person instruction in the fall and want to vaccinate as many students as possible before classes begin next month. District officials said they are “not in a position” to mandate COVID-19 shots but will ask families to submit COVID-19 vaccine documents, as is the practice with other immunizations. Starting next week, the district will offer vaccines at three school sites for students and their families. The sites will be able to administer 600 doses weekly. The district is also working with hospitals for events in areas with low inoculation rates and offering the shots at back-to-school events. “Schools are trusted pillars of our communities, and as a district we are uniquely suited to help expand vaccination opportunities, which helps create the safest possible learning environments at our schools,” said Jose M. Torres, interim schools CEO. More than 50,000 children under the age of 18 have already been vaccinated in Chicago, according to the city’s Department of Public Health. Roughly 350,000 students attend Chicago Public Schools.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As federal officials debate pouring billions of dollars into broadband access, data suggests many of Indiana’s schoolchildren and adults who preferred to work from home spent the pandemic with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state’s least-wealthy counties. In about half of Indiana’s counties – 47 of 92 – measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 79% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft – 47 of 92 counties – no more than 22% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of Senate moderates have reached a deal on a far-reaching infrastructure plan that would direct $65 billion to increase broadband connectivity from coast to coast. Despite the agreement, it’s unclear whether it would address the solutions some lawmakers want to see such as continued broadband subsidies for low-income families, greater competition among wireless providers, and continued buildout of high-speed networks in poorer, rural areas. In Indiana, 12.4% of residents don’t have adequate broadband infrastructure, and 48.4% live in areas with only one internet provider, according to the White House.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A teenager injured in an accident on an amusement ride that killed his younger brother remained on life support Wednesday as he turned 16, his family pastor said. David Jaramillo has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children’s Hospital since Saturday’s accident on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, pastor Christian Shields said. David has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said. The pastor at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids said it’s a miracle that David is alive after being pinned underneath a boat in water for several minutes. The church, which planned a prayer vigil for the family Wednesday night, is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised $30,000. Friends have brought balloons to the hospital for David’s birthday, but “there won’t be a lot of celebrating,” Shields said. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland on Saturday to celebrate David’s upcoming birthday. The junior at Linn-Mar High School had been excited about getting his driver’s license as a step toward freedom and adulthood, Shields said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has expanded the paid leave that state employees can take from their jobs when they become parents or act as caregivers. Kelly issued an executive order Tuesday that provides an extra two weeks of paid leave for state workers who are a child’s primary caregiver and an extra week for secondary caregivers. The order also makes foster parents eligible for the same paid leave. Primary caregivers will now receive up to eight weeks of paid leave, rather than six. Secondary caregivers will receive four weeks instead of three. The order directed the state Department of Administration to put the new policies into effect immediately. Kelly said the state is demonstrating a commitment to recruiting and keeping talented workers and creating a “supportive environment for our families.” “Supporting working parents in our workforce is not only the right thing to do,” Kelly said in a statement. “It’s good for our economy.” The order also says new state employees become eligible for paid leave after 180 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: After years of planning and public input, the construction phase of the Sherman Minton Bridge rehabilitation project will soon be underway. The Sherman Minton Renewal project team said Tuesday that it will begin working on ramp improvements next week. The improvements “are being made to prepare for the first phase of the rehabilitation, which will include the first half of eastbound construction on the lower deck and painting of the bridge trusses,” according to a news release. According to the team, ramp shoulders at the Interstates 65 and 265 interchange, as well as the Interstates 64 and 265 interchange, will be modified to accommodate additional traffic. The modification process will take one to two weeks, the team said, and “will require nighttime lane closures and/or ramp closures to construct.” After the ramp improvements are completed, traffic will be reduced to two lanes in each direction as the team works on painting and deck replacement preparations. When lanes are restricted, I-65 and I-265 will serve as a detour route, the team said. The Sherman Minton, which spans the Ohio River to connect the Bluegrass and Hoosier states, is 59 years old. The proposal to rehabilitate the double-decker bridge was announced in 2018. The price tag for the project is roughly $137 million.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities say they’ve been searching for a 12-foot python that escaped from its enclosure inside the state’s largest shopping mall. Cara, a yellow and white Burmese python, slithered out of its enclosure at the Blue Zoo in the Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, news outlets report. She was still on the loose early Wednesday morning, WBRZ-TV reports, after a search overnight, when such snakes are most active. “While we’ve created a very secure home for Cara, our Burmese Python, she has slithered out of her exhibit,” the Blue Zoo said in a statement. “Cara is a non-poisonous, friendly snake that enjoys her time interacting with guests during our Snake Education Shows.” Pythons slowly squeeze their prey to death before swallowing them. Cara was described as “very sweet” by her handlers, who released a photo of the animal. The Blue Zoo – which bills itself as “more than an aquarium, more than a zoo” – was closed Tuesday while search efforts continued, but the Mall of Louisiana remained open.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Enrollment in public schools across the state dropped by 4.4%, nearly 8,000 students, between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, according to Maine Department of Education data. Most of those students transitioned to home schooling, which saw an increase of 5,000 students, according to department data. School systems expect many students to return for the 2021-22 school year, Bangor Daily News reports. According to an Education Week report, Maine had the fourth-highest decrease in the nation behind Vermont’s 5.3% decrease, Mississippi’s 5% drop and New Hampshire’s 4.7% decline. Steve Bailey, executive director at Maine School Management Association, said the change reflects concerns from parents about safety during the pandemic and child care challenges. The most significant decrease was in prekindergarten and kindergarten students, for whom the population decreased by 16%, compared to a 3% decrease in all other students.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: Teenagers will be entered to win $50,000 college scholarships if they get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the state’s latest incentive program offered to encourage as many people as possible to get the shots. Gov. Larry Hogan announced the new lottery program Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. Twenty Marylanders between the ages of 12 and 17 will win scholarships worth $50,000 each between now and Labor Day. The program will give away a total of $1 million in scholarships or the equivalent of full tuition and fees at one of Maryland’s public universities. Winners who choose to attend college out of state can transfer the scholarship to the school of their choice, Hogan said. The program will begin Monday and continue through Labor Day. Teens who have been vaccinated in Maryland are eligible and will be automatically entered, the governor said. Winners will be chosen using the same process as “VaxCash,” a lottery for adults that recently ended. That program awarded a total of $2 million in prizes to Marylanders 18 and older who had received a COVID-19 vaccine at any time. The scholarship prizes will be deposited into college savings accounts with Maryland 529.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nTopsfield: A more than 200-year-old agricultural fair canceled last year because of the pandemic is scheduled to return this fall, organizers announced Wednesday. The 11-day Topsfield Fair, first held in 1818, will start Oct. 1, the Essex Agricultural Society said in a statement. “Having to cancel last year’s Topsfield Fair due to the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating,” General Manager James O’Brien said. “We are thrilled to announce that the fair will return this year with no restrictions, and we look forward to seeing everyone on the fairgrounds in October.” The fair was previously canceled for three years during World War II and in 1918 because of an influenza pandemic. Based on attendance in 1946 after the three-year shutdown, O’Brien said he expects high attendance this fall. In anticipation, fair personnel have installed extra sinks and hand-sanitizing stations around the fairgrounds north of Boston, he said. One of the fair’s most popular events is the giant pumpkin contest, but it also includes livestock exhibits, a midway, vendors, food stalls and live music. It typically draws up to 500,000 visitors per year. A schedule for concerts, which are free with fair admission, will be announced soon.\n\nMichigan\n\nRoseville: CARE of Southeastern Michigan is hosting a free, two-week day camp for kids whose family members struggle with addiction. Open for children in preschool through eighth grade, Camp CARE will address communicating effectively, managing emotions, dealing with change, choosing friends wisely, resisting peer pressure and more. The skills are taught through hands-on activities like arts, crafts and games, said CARE director of substance use prevention Kaitlin Maloziec. The Roseville fire and police departments will also visit the camp for a teaching segment in the city about 15 miles northeast of Detroit. “It’s just a spot where kids can be kids, make friendships and see that they’re not alone,” Maloziec said. The camp will be held at Fountain Elementary in Roseville from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. July 19-23 and July 26-30. Zoom sessions for parents and caregivers will teach adults some of the same skills as the youth, along with parenting tips and advice on how to talk about addiction and address kids’ questions. The camp, which Maloziec said has been around for more than two decades, is hosting up to 60 students this year. Most activities will be held outdoors, with mask-wearing required and lunch provided. Registration is available online and closes at 11:45 p.m. Friday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: With COVID-19 limits fading away, tourists are returning to Minnesota resorts, many of them from neighboring states. But a lot of employees are not coming back. The worker shortage has been building for more than a year, said Ben Wogsland, a spokesman for Hospitality Minnesota, the trade association for the state’s hotels, restaurants, resorts and campgrounds. The industry is down about 50,000 workers from its normal summer level of 280,000 to 290,000 workers. Many of them found other jobs during the first COVID-19 shutdown, and others left when a second hospitality shutdown was ordered, the Star Tribune reports. “After last year, we were hopeful that things would get back to normal,” said Sue Dutcher, manager of the St. Croix River Resort in Hinckley. Instead, “we’re being run ragged.” In Detroit Lakes, Joanne Anderson faces a similar challenge at the Forest Hills Resort. Anderson manages Izzo’s, the resort’s bar and restaurant, and is running it with eight workers instead of the usual 20. Some operators have been fortunate enough to escape the labor shortage. The Trail Center Lodge on the Gunflint Trail is “100% staffed,” according to owner Sarah Hamilton. That’s partly due to a new program that brings young adults from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to work at businesses on the North Shore.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Farmers in the state are losing the catfish wars against their foreign competitors with the very weapon they saw as their salvation. The domestic catfish industry, along with lawmakers including the late U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, lobbied to move oversight of catfish processing from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture five years ago with the expectation the USDA’s stricter eye would limit the foreign imports that had decimated domestic production throughout the Mississippi Delta. Instead, imports of siluriformes – the larger category of catfish and catfish-like fish sometimes referred to by their family name, “pangasius” – have only increased since the switch to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service in 2016. Meanwhile, domestic prices and production, mainly in Mississippi and other Southern states, have continued to decline. Almost 65,000 additional tons of catfish were imported in 2019 compared to 2015 before the Food Safety and Inspection Service took over, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service. The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce lists recent processing volumes at 5 million pounds per month less than in 2015 during FDA oversight.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Seventeen more people in southwest Missouri died from COVID-19 in a two-week period ending Sunday as the coronavirus continues to surge in the region, officials said. The deaths were recorded in the two-week reporting period from June 21 to July 4 and were disclosed Tuesday by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, the Kansas City Star reports. The dead ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and none of those who died was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Republican Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday told reporters that his administration has done “everything possible” to fend off outbreaks. Missouri has reported nearly 530,000 cases of the virus and 9,375 deaths since the pandemic began. The state has administered more than 5 million doses, with 44.9% of the population getting at least one. Parson said he’s focused on encouraging people to get inoculated and making the shots available to them. He said he’s still wary of incentivizing vaccinations with prizes. “Right now, the vaccine’s out there,” Parson said. “I mean, people walk past it every day, whether they’re in a pharmacy, whether they’re in a Walmart, whether they’re in a health center.” Parson also on Wednesday signed a bill into law to limit lawsuits against companies for wrongdoing related to the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Wildlife officials were searching by ground and from the air Wednesday for a grizzly bear that killed a woman who was camping. A helicopter was flying over the area around the small town of Ovando, in western Montana, in pursuit of the bear, which will be killed if found, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon said. Large traps made out of culverts were set around the area in hopes of capturing the bruin. Ovando, about 60 miles northwest of Helena, is a community of fewer than 100 people at the edge of the sprawling Bob Marshall wilderness. Long-distance bicyclists such as the victim often spend the night in the town. Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said the bear wandered into the victim’s camping area a couple of times before Tuesday’s fatal mauling. Someone at the scene used bear spray, and other campers called 911, Roselles said. Roselles closed down any camping in Ovando as the search for the bear continued, following creeks leading away from the town. Further circumstances surrounding the attack were under investigation. Officials said their priority was to find and kill the bear to prevent another dangerous encounter.\n\nNebraska\n\nNiobrara: A tomahawk once owned by Chief Standing Bear, a pioneering Native American civil rights leader, is returning to his Nebraska tribe after decades in a museum at Harvard. The university’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology said it’s been working with members of the Ponca Tribe in Nebraska and Oklahoma to repatriate the artifact. Larry Wright Jr., chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said Tuesday that the return of the historic weapon is a powerful symbol of homecoming for the tribe, which was among many forcibly relocated from their homelands to other territories by the federal government in the 1800s. Standing Bear was arrested 1878 for leaving the tribe’s reservation in order to fulfill a promise he made to bury his eldest son back in their tribe’s homeland in the Niobrara River Valley. In his landmark federal trial, he successfully argued for the recognition of Native Americans as persons entitled to rights and protection under law. “That hand is not the color of yours. But if you pierce it, I shall feel pain,” Standing Bear famously said in court. “The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.” Wright said the tribe is preparing its own museum, located near Standing Bear’s grave, to properly display the tomahawk and other artifacts.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A 110-acre property at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip has been purchased to be the site for a terminal station for a planned new high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and Southern California. Brightline Holdings announced the purchase Tuesday without announcing the price, but local news outlets report that Clark County records indicate the purchase by the holding company for Brightline West closed Thursday for $140 million. The site is on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard across from Premium Outlets South mall and near McCarran International Airport. Company officials have said Brightline West trains would carry up to 500 passengers at speeds up to 200 mph on the planned route between Las Vegas and Victorville, California. The project has been delayed over the years, most recently because of the pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Plans to close the state’s youth detention center are quickly taking shape, with a consultant due to submit a preliminary report in the next two weeks. The two-year state budget Gov. Chris Sununu signed June 25 includes a mandate to close the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester by March 2023. But the state Department of Health and Human Services didn’t wait for lawmakers and the governor to act; it signed a $55,000 contract with Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services of Washington, D.C., on June 8. The contract, paid for with federal pandemic aid, requires the consultants to deliver a draft closure plan by mid-July and a final report by August. According to details submitted to the governor’s Executive Council last week, the department didn’t have time to solicit bids given the time-sensitive work but consulted with stakeholders before hiring the firm. Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette told the council she met with advocates for juvenile justice, including the Disability Rights Center and the Office of the Child Advocate. “We have this opportunity to build the right-sized program on a clinical model instead of a detention model. So I brought the advocates together to say, ‘What is your ideal model?’ ” she said. “They said they weren’t qualified and that I should hire a consultant. So that is what I did.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater: The pandemic that closed restaurant dining rooms last year also put a stop to food tours. But with eateries up and running again, food tours are starting back up, too, inviting food lovers to explore a town by enjoying its restaurants’ signature dishes and learning about local history. “For the first time in 15 months, we are opening public tours again, and it is really exciting,” said Alessia Aron, owner of Beyond the Plate Tours, which presents excursions in Jersey City, Red Bank and Somerville. Local restaurants “have been through hell and back, and we are just trying to support them as much as possible.” Her company, previously Jersey Girls Food Tours, is one of seven that comprise the NJ Food Tour Trail. “We thought that coming together and creating the New Jersey Food Tour Trail would help us come out of the pandemic better,” said Audrey Wiggins, owner of On the Town Food Tours, another participant. “July 1 is our official opening date for all tour companies; some have started a little earlier than that, but everyone is now officially open.” Other NJ Food Tour Trail companies include Asbury Park Food Tours, Cape May Food Tours, Sister Cities Food and Shop Tours, Savor and Stroll Culinary Tours and Have You Met Newark Tours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A new podcast called Parks urges visitors to America’s national parks to educate themselves about and acknowledge the Indigenous tribes whose ties to these sacred spaces span millennia. The aim of the documentary podcast is to explore the history of tribes on these lands, the ways in which the lands were dispossessed, issues the Indigenous communities face today, and how they’ve kept their culture and traditions alive, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. “There’s so much that was written, but when it was written, it was from the point of view of Eastern colonizers,” said Mary Mathis, 25, a former photo editor at National Public Radio and Outside magazine who serves as the host of Parks, co-created with fellow Santa Fe-based multimedia journalist Cody Nelson. “It wasn’t every story, it was just one story – the quote-unquote ‘winner’s’ story. We see that a lot in our education system, and I think that was where the idea (for Parks) kind of came from.” The first episode follows a format the Parks team plans to replicate throughout the project, one in which Indigenous guests are closely involved in each step of the editing process so as to maintain complete ownership of their stories.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A consortium of businesses and nonprofits will run Central Park’s Wollman ice rink, one of four recreational concessions that were operated by Donald Trump’s company until the city canceled its contracts with the former president, the city Department of Parks and Recreation announced Tuesday. A joint venture called Wollman Park Partners LLC is expected to be awarded a five-year contract to run the rink after submitting the winning bid for the project, city officials said. The joint venture, which includes Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, Related Companies, Equinox, caterer Great Performances and local groups such as Ice Hockey in Harlem, will reinvest all profits into upgrading the rink, city officials said. “It’s the Summer of New York City, but we’re already preparing for an iconic winter, too,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release. “I’m thrilled that NYC Parks has found a quality operator for Wollman Rink that is committed to reinvesting in the community and creating a welcoming space for all New Yorkers.” The Democrat announced in January that the city would terminate business contracts with the Trump Organization over Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The cancellations affected a golf course in the Bronx and a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A Superior Court judge put a small-town newspaper editor behind bars last month after one of his reporters used an audio recorder for note-taking purposes at a murder trial – a punishment the paper and media rights groups consider excessive. Judge Stephan Futrell sentenced Gavin Stone, the news editor of the Richmond County Daily Journal, to five days in jail before having the editor hauled off to jail. Stone was released the next day but still faces the possibility of more time in lockup. Brian Bloom, the paper’s publisher, acknowledged that his reporter shouldn’t have had the recorder in court because it was not allowed but criticized the judge’s move to imprison an editor for a minor infraction committed by a colleague. “The penalty does not fit the crime,” he said. “Let’s put this in perspective: You stop a murder trial not once, but twice, because a guy had a tape recorder sitting next to him on a bench at a courtroom. Let’s put our priorities in place here.” Futrell did not respond to a request for comment. Superior Court rules allow electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings but grant judges the authority to prohibit the technology.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: The Mandan City Commission has agreed to equip the community’s police force with body cameras. The commission approved the cameras unanimously Tuesday with no discussion. The police department received a quote from Digital-Ally, which already has cameras inside the police vehicles. A memo from police to commissioners said that using the same company for the cameras will allow for better integration of the equipment, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The package of 28 body cameras, upgraded in-car cameras, accessories, set-up, training and cloud storage would cost about $165,000 for a five-year subscription. The police department also received approval to request funding from the U.S. Department of Justice to offset the cost of the cameras. It is asking for nearly $37,000 over five years, according to the memo. The Lincoln Police Department began using body cameras in early 2020. The Bismarck Police Department and the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Department do not use the technology.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The top prosecutor in one of the state’s most populous counties has decided his office will no longer offer plea bargains in any cases involving gun violence or possession of illegal firearms. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters announced his decision Tuesday, saying it would take effect immediately. “It’s time for this nonsense to end,” Deters said. The directive comes in the wake of a violent holiday weekend in Cincinnati. Among the incidents was a Fourth of July shooting at a downtown park where authorities say a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy opened fire on each other, leaving both of them dead and three innocent bystanders wounded. Hundreds of teens were gathered at Smale Park when the shooting occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Sunday, authorities say. At the time, police officers were working to clear out the riverfront park before its closing time. “People must be held accountable for their choices. As a community, we must stand together and say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” Deters said. “No amount of money can fix the problems we are facing. Parents must parent their children. Communities must speak up.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nEdmond: U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe’s office announced Wednesday that he requested $4 million in federal funds to help combat illegal marijuana growing operations in the state. Inhofe’s chief of staff, Luke Holland, announced the request during an Oklahoma Sheriffs Association meeting, saying Inhofe requested a direct appropriation through the U.S. Justice Department to allow the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to establish a unit to combat “transnational and national drug organizations.” The unit would work with sheriffs to combat illegal drug operations. Medical marijuana is a booming business in Oklahoma, where voters in 2018 approved one of the nation’s most liberal medical programs. As a result, out-of-state weed entrepreneurs have flocked to the state to get involved. But sheriffs and other law enforcement groups, which opposed the state question in 2018, have said illegal marijuana grow operations are setting up in rural parts of Oklahoma and funneling cannabis into the illegal drug trade in Oklahoma and other states.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon said Tuesday that it will start the second phase of building the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact after receiving another $500million donation for the project. Construction on the first phase of the new campus started in 2016 – after the first half-billion-dollar gift from the Nike co-founder and his wife – with a large science building including a pedestrian bridge over the street. A second building for “bioengineering and applied science research building to support expanded research programs and facilities” will be built next, according to a university news release. The building is planned to cover 175,000 square feet, with multiple stories, and be located north of the first building. The focus of the new campus is to translate scientific discoveries into advances in health care and other fields. The latest money will also pay for 14 to 16 additional faculty members and their teams. The new campus currently employs 13 tenure-related faculty members and their research teams, for a total of about 90 employees. “The aim of the new campus is to compress the timeline between discovery and “societal impact,” said Robert Guldberg, vice president and executive director of the new science operation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Tolls on the Pennsylvania Turnpike will rise another 5% in January, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decided Tuesday. The agency board voted to impose the higher rates as of Jan. 2. The most common E-ZPass fare for a passenger vehicle will rise by a dime, from $1.60 to $1.70. Those being charged through a scan of their license plate will see the most common fare go from $3.90 to $4.10. The most common truck fare will go from $13 to $13.70 for E-ZPass and from $26.60 to $28 for toll-by-plate. Officials say 2022 will be the first time in six years that fares will have jumped by less than 6%. The turnpike has pumped more than $7 billion in funding from tolls to the state Transportation Department since 2007.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Almost $54 million worth of fraudulent unemployment claims have been filed during the coronavirus pandemic, state officials say. The latest total is about $9 million more than in May, with even more victims coming forward in the past month, according to WJAR-TV. State Department of Labor and Training Director Matt Weldon said that doesn’t necessarily mean the claims were filed during that time span, just that they are coming to light now. The agency has managed to get back about $3.75 million so far with the help of federal agencies, but Weldon said he believes that will grow significantly in the coming months. The agency is also enforcing rules that require people to look for work while collecting benefits, he said. With 64,000 Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits, that will be a slow process, with the agency only able to get through a few hundred claims per week to start, he said. “As you can imagine, trying to audit claims and go through information is difficult when there are more than a workable number, so we are going to begin with hundreds and see how that goes, and then that can grow in the future,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants a new abortion law to take effect, arguing Wednesday that a judge’s decision to put the whole measure – and not just the parts being challenged in court – on hold during a lawsuit “oversteps the bounds of federal judicial power.” Gov. Henry McMaster’s brief with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asks appellate judges to lift a lower court’s injunction on the South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act. The Republican signed the measure into law earlier this year that requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus, which can typically be detected about six weeks after conception. If cardiac activity is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Planned Parenthood attorneys sued immediately, and the entire law has been blocked from going into effect during the litigation. In his brief, attorneys for McMaster argued that decision represents “overreaching federal power to interfere with state law.” McMaster, along with other defendants including state Attorney General Alan Wilson, also argue that the groups that sued don’t have proper standing to challenge the law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMadison: An increasing number of primarily social media complaints from residents in Madison and Lake County have brought to light a little-known county ordinance banning people from occupying their campers or recreational vehicles outside the confines of a campground. Lake County Planning and Zoning Officer Mandi Anderson said the ordinance has gone undetected for many years until a recent barrage of postings that have led to heated debate among residents. Some who are opposed to the rule say that it infringes on property rights and that there should be nothing wrong with letting visitors use a camper for a short time. “I didn’t realize it was this out of hand,” Anderson said. One theory for the ordinance, Anderson said, is that people who construct large lakeside homes on small lots do not want to be inundated with noise from adjoining property when three campers pull in for the weekend and 50 people take up temporary residence, The Madison Daily Leader reports. Anderson said citations are only issued if the matter is not addressed after the property owner has been notified about the ordinance and has been given an opportunity to comply. She emphasized she does not drive around looking for violators but only responds to complaints.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are inviting the public to celebrate and remember civil rights icon John Lewis in a dedication ceremony next week. Earlier this year, Nashville’s Metro Council renamed a large portion of Fifth Avenue North to Rep. John Lewis Way. Councilwoman Zulfat Suara submitted the request last year, focusing on Lewis’ work to desegregate Nashville’s lunch counters before becoming a long-serving congressman in Georgia. The city will host a dedication July 16-17. The event was originally scheduled for February but was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. As a college student at American Baptist College and then Fisk University, Lewis helped desegregate public spaces in Nashville and pushed for racial justice across the South. Lewis was a Freedom Rider, spoke at the March on Washington, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Lewis died July 17, 2020. He was 80.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Air Force is mostly responsible for a former serviceman killing more than two dozen people at a church in 2017 because it failed to submit his criminal history into a database, which should have prevented him from purchasing firearms. U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez in San Antonio wrote in a ruling signed Wednesday that the Air Force was “60% responsible” for the massacre at First Baptist Church in the small town of Sutherland Springs, where Devin Kelley opened fire during a Sunday service. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant. The attack remains the worst mass shooting in Texas history. “The trial conclusively established that no other individual – not even Kelley’s own parents or partners – knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,” Rodriguez wrote. Kelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child’s skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers and from possessing body armor.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hospital leaders renewed their pleas for people to get vaccinated Wednesday as the state experiences another surge in new coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant. That strain has begun to surge in Utah over the past month and now represents about 80% of cases in the state, said Dr. Michelle Hofmann, deputy director of the state health department. Utah has averaged about 386 confirmed cases per day over the past week, nearly double the case rate the state was experiencing at its lowest point in early June. The surge is largely occurring in unvaccinated people who are being infected and hospitalized at six times the rate of vaccinated people, Hoffman said. “The frustrating part about all of this is that, unlike last year, we have all the tools to stop this pandemic in its tracks,” Hoffman told reporters during a virtual briefing. “The COVID-19 vaccines work.” Utah now ranks fourth in the nation for new cases per capita, and the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 31% over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Utah met health officials’ goal of vaccinating 70% of adults and 25% of children ages 12 to 15 with at least one dose by the Fourth of July, but hospital leaders say more people need to be vaccinated to avoid hospitals from being overrun again.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: The FIS Ski World Cup will be returning to the Killington Ski Resort this November. Over the years the event has drawn tens of thousands of people to the town on Thanksgiving weekend. It was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington Resort & Pico Mountain, said in a news release that in addition to skiing, there will be a full weekend of activities, including live music. Joshua Eckler, owner of Trailside Inn, told the Rutland Herald he thinks this will be a big year for the World Cup, given the past 14 months of travel restrictions. “We try to encourage a lot of guests to come for it even if they’re not ski racing fans because it’s more of an experience,” Eckler said. “You don’t have to be a die-hard racing fan to enjoy the event, just because of the music and the atmosphere and the excitement – everybody is screaming for everybody.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Workers removed a statue of Harry F. Byrd Sr., a former governor, U.S. senator and staunch segregationist, from the state’s Capitol Square on Wednesday morning. A crane hoisted the larger-than-life statue off its pedestal, and workers then strapped it to a truck to be hauled into storage until lawmakers determine its final disposition. Byrd, a Democrat, ran the state’s most powerful political machine for decades until his death in 1966 and was considered the architect of the state’s racist “massive resistance” policy to public school integration. Lawmakers voted to remove the statue earlier this year, a decision that came amid a years­long movement in history-rich Virginia to rethink who is honored in the state’s public spaces. The statue erected in 1976 was located a stone’s throw from the Capitol. A nearby plaque said the statue was dedicated in appreciation of Byrd’s “devotion throughout a long public career to governmental restraint and programs in the best interest of all the people of Virginia.” Byrd’s son, the late Harry Byrd Jr., a Democrat-turned-independent who began his career as a segregationist, succeeded his father in the Senate, serving until 1983.\n\nWashington\n\nRichland: A new state report finds that more than 57% of Hanford Nuclear Reservation workers reported exposure to hazardous material on the former nuclear weapons production site in south-central Washington state. The Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board recently released its final report and recommendations on the unmet health care needs of Hanford workers. The report’s central recommendation calls for creation of a new, independent Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Center. It would provide a centralized clearinghouse for dissemination of accepted scientific literature. Important functions would also include evaluation and communication of newly available studies about Hanford-specific hazards. For incurable diseases such as chronic beryllium disease, information sharing could be key to finding cures. Additionally, the center would promote research to increase the body of knowledge for the Hanford workforce. Hanford for decades made plutonium for nuclear weapons, and thousands of workers are now tasked with cleaning up the nation’s largest volume of radioactive wastes. “The working families that make up the Hanford community represent a very unique population, with occupational risks not easily quantified or identified,” said Nickolas A. Bumpaous, Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board co-chair.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Traffic on the West Virginia Turnpike around the Fourth of July weekend was the heaviest since 2010. The turnpike saw 668,000 vehicles pass through its toll booths between Thursday and Monday, the state Department of Transportation said in a news release Tuesday. That’s 28% higher than for the five-day period a year ago, when travel was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “It was a huge Fourth of July period,” said West Virginia Parkways Authority executive director Jeff Miller. “People are just ready to get out and travel.” Miller said many travelers started trips the weekend before the Fourth of July and returned home the weekend after. Between June 27 and Monday, more than 1.12 million vehicles went through the turnpike’s toll booths, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: In a cheese-obsessed state that proudly touts itself as America’s Dairyland, the dairy cow is the official domestic animal, milk is the official state beverage, and cheese is the official dairy product. But even though Wisconsin produces more cheese than any other state at 3.4 billion pounds each year, there is no official state cheese. A bipartisan bill heard by a state Assembly committee on Wednesday would change that. The measure makes colby, which was created in Wisconsin more than 100 years ago, the official cheese. Colby may be as “gouda” choice as any, but the choice threatens to turn fans of cheddar, swiss, provolone and other varieties red, or perhaps blue, in the face with rage. Colby also holds a special place in Wisconsin cheese history. It was created in the central Wisconsin city of Colby in 1885 by Joseph Steinwand, who named it after the township where his father built northern Clark County’s first cheese factory, according to a state historical marker in the city, located about 40 miles west of Wausau. Colby isn’t the most-produced cheese in Wisconsin. Mozzarella is tops, followed by cheddar and some Italian varieties, according to the USDA. Still, more than 45 million pounds of colby are produced at Wisconsin’s 150 cheese plants each year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s first female federal district judge plans to semi-retire in 2022, opening the way for Democratic President Joe Biden to nominate a judge in the deeply Republican state. Going on senior status will give U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal in Cheyenne more control over the number and type of cases she oversees. She plans to spend more of her free time with her husband, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal, and grandchildren, Freudenthal told the Casper Star-Tribune. She hasn’t decided yet how she will use her time as judge but might stop taking new criminal cases to provide freedom from speedy trial requirements, she said. Freudenthal had no experience with criminal cases before becoming a federal district judge in 2010. She has found those cases the most rewarding because they can be life-changing for convicts, Freudenthal said. “Yes, their lives going forward will still be very challenging, but they have the opportunity to rebuild that life, take advantage of resources, hopefully live a life of sobriety,” she said. Freudenthal, 67, holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. She was an attorney in the offices of Govs. Ed Herschler and Mike Sullivan from 1980 to 1989.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/08"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\n(CNN) Research on ancient footprints has previously challenged what's known about when people arrived in North America, and a new discovery could shed more light on the story.\n\nScientists have found 88 fossilized prints belonging to adults and children, likely dating back 12,000 years, in shallow riverbeds on the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range . This is only the second set of human tracks from the Ice Age to be identified in what is now the United States.\n\nFootprints record a specific type of evidence that most people cannot get from other types of archaeological or fossil records, said Kevin Hatala, paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was not involved in the discovery.\n\n\"You can understand how large these individuals were,\" Hatala said. \"You can understand how they were moving. When you see multiple trackways of footprints within the same site, you can start to understand how many people were likely there.\"\n\n\"Were they likely traveling together or were they moving in different ways?\" he added.\n\nDaron Duke shows visitors footprints discovered on the Air Force's Utah Test and Training Range.\n\nThe fossils can offer important insight on present-day populations as well, said Daron Duke, principal investigator for the research and archaeologist for the Nevada-based Far Western Anthropological Research Group.\n\n\"It also connects the people ancestral to the area to the finds,\" he said.\n\nAn inadvertent find\n\nThe discovery occurred somewhat by accident, according to Duke and Tommy Urban, a research scientist at Cornell University in New York.\n\nDuke and Urban were searching Utah Test and Training Range in early July for remnants of purposeful prehistoric campfires, which were used by ancient humans as a source of light and heat. As they were driving around the Air Force base and talking about what fossilized footprints look like, Urban noticed one and the men stopped to inspect the print. After further examination, they identified dozens more in the area.\n\nAt first, they were unsure the footprints had been made by humans. But after several days evaluating the tracks' size, shape and stride length, the researchers determined they were the work of barefoot human adults and children. While the archeologists are still working to confirm the age of the footprints via radiocarbon dating, they believe the tracks are 12,000 years old based on the previously dated sediment layer beneath them, and the fact that the prints were exposed to the surface around the same time as artifacts found to be 12,300 years old, Duke said.\n\nAdditionally, the freshwater wetlands needed to preserve the prints have not existed in the area for at least 10,000 years.\n\nIn 2021, scientists used radiocarbon dating to find that 61 footprints discovered in 2020 in White Sands National Park in New Mexico -- many belonging to teenagers and young children -- were 21,000 to 23,000 years old. This would mean that humans inhabited North America during the Pleistocene era, or Ice Age, around 7,500 years earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"Once I realized that (the Utah tracks) were barefoot human footprints, it was very exciting,\" said Urban via email. \"I had been working on footprints at White Sands for the previous five years, so it was astounding to think that we had just stumbled onto a second White Sands.\"\n\nGoing forward, the researchers need to preserve and protect the Utah prints and find out who the prints belonged to and when exactly they are from, Duke said.\n\nA distant human connection\n\nThe find is an exciting one for the field of archaeological research, said David Madsen, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada-Reno. He was not involved in the discovery.\n\nThe researchers are working to preserve and learn more about the prints.\n\n\"Now that we have this human element, the story of the very early people becomes more real. There's more funding available, there's more interest in it, there'll be more recovery,\" Madsen said.\n\nThe location of the latest footprint discovery is near a site in northwestern Utah where researchers found numerous human artifacts in 2015, including stone tools and the earliest evidence of human tobacco use in the world . The relics date back to around the same time the prints were made.\n\nThe proximity of the sites and the fact that the evidence is likely from the same time period tells archeologists a greater story about the people who may have inhabited the area during the Ice Age, Duke said.\n\nAdditionally, learning more about the prints may offer a better understanding of the Indigenous population in the western US.\n\nThere are 21 Indigenous communities in the region, and people from these communities are helping the researchers in the examination of the footprints.", "authors": ["Rachel Fadem"], "publish_date": "2022/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/09/10/prehistoric-native-american-arrowhead-artifact-found-alligator-mississippi/8271061002/", "title": "Prehistoric Native American artifact found in gator's stomach", "text": "JACKSON, Miss. – What does a 750-pound alligator eat? Well, just about anything it wants, but items found in this particular Mississippi alligator's stomach defy odds and date back thousands of years.\n\nShane Smith, owner of Red Antler Processing in Yazoo City, Mississippi, said he was examining contents of a 13-foot, 5-inch alligator that weighed 750 pounds and discovered two unusual objects. One he couldn't identify, but the other was clearly a broken stone arrowhead.\n\nThe find was so unexpected, he almost didn't let the news out.\n\n\"At first, I thought 'I'm not posting this on Facebook,' because no one will believe it,\" Smith said.\n\nThen, he had second thoughts.\n\n\"This is too cool not to post of Facebook,\" he said. \"This has probably never happened before. We gotta post this.\"\n\nAlligators in Mississippi:5 things you may not know about the South's apex predator\n\nDog tags in an alligator's stomach\n\nThe story first began to unfold in April when a wild game processor in South Carolina reported opening the stomach of an alligator and finding unusual items. Smith read it and was skeptical.\n\n\"The curiosity struck me when I saw a post online about someone finding dog tags in an alligator's stomach,\" Smith said.\n\nTo satisfy that curiosity, Smith decided to examine contents of the larger alligators he processed. The first was a 13-foot, 2-inch, 787-pound gator taken by Ty Powell of Columbia, Mississippi.\n\n\"We found a bullet in it, and it had not been fired from a gun,\" Smith said. \"I don't know how it got in there.\"\n\nThe second alligator he opened, which was harvested at Eagle Lake, located 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg on the Mississippi and Louisiana border, contained many of the things the first did, including bones, hair, feathers and stones. Then, something else caught his eye.\n\nA find like no other\n\n\"Everybody was standing around like I was opening a Christmas present,\" Smith said. \"We kind of put it all in a bin.\n\n\"I looked over and saw a rock with a different tint to it. It was the arrowhead.\"\n\nSmith said he was dumbfounded.\n\n\"It was just disbelief,\" Smith said. \"There's just no way he had an arrowhead. Your first thought is it ate (a Native American) or (a Native American) shot it in the stomach.\"\n\nSmith knew that wasn't the case, though.\n\n\"My best hypothesis is wherever he scooped up those other rocks, he got that (Native American) point,\" Smith said. \"We joked about it and said I'm probably the only person on Earth to pull an arrowhead out of an alligator's stomach.\"\n\nPoint dates back thousands of years\n\nJames Starnes, director of Surface Geology and Surface Mapping for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, examined a photograph of the point. He estimated it was made about 5000-6000 BC.\n\n'That is the latter part of the Early Archaic and early part of the Middle Archaic (periods),\" Starnes said. \"How the base is made is real tell-tale in estimating the time period.\"\n\nStarnes also noted the object is not an arrowhead. It's a point used on an early weapon that launches a spear using a second piece of wood with a cup on one end which acts as a lever to increase velocity.\n\n\"That's an atlatl dart point,\" Starnes said. \"People think all heads are arrowheads, but those (arrowheads) would be the little bitty points.\"\n\nAs bizarre as the find was, it was about to get even stranger. Smith found a heavy, tear-shaped object roughly 1½ inches in length. Both he and the hunter who was permitted to harvested the alligator thought it was something more modern — a lead weight used for fishing.\n\n\"It's heavy like lead,\" Hamilton said. \"It looks like it's got two holes in it, but they don't go through it.\n\n\"It's got a little hole and a bigger hole on top. I guess it goes in and comes back out.\"\n\nWhat's a plummet, and why would an alligator eat it?\n\nStarnes said it's known as a plummet and dates back to the Late Archaic Period, or about 1700 BC.\n\nThe weight is accounted for because it's made of hematite, an iron oxide traded between early groups and shines when polished. Starnes said what purpose plummets served is unknown.\n\n\"The plummets, we really have no idea what they were used for,\" Starnes said. \"These things had some significance, but we have no idea. We can only guess.\"\n\nSo, how did these ancient objects get into the alligator's belly? Ricky Flynt, Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks Alligator Program coordinator, explained very hard objects, typically stones, aid the reptiles in digestion.\n\n\"Alligators, like other animals such as birds and other reptiles, are known for ingesting grit and rocks to help with digestion,\" Flynt said. \"We know alligators and crocodiles do that.\"\n\nHowever, alligators differ from fowl such as chickens and ducks. Those animals have gizzards and the grit and sand is stored there to help grind seeds and grains they consume. Alligators don't have gizzards and the stones go into the stomach.\n\n\"Sticks, wood; things they can't digest get into their stomachs,\" Flynt said. \"I found a piece of cypress in an alligator's stomach that was 15 inches long.\"\n\nFollow Clarion Ledger Outdoors on Facebook and @BrianBroom on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2020/10/12/two-venice-businesses-turn-searching-for-fossils-and-sharks-teeth-into-lasting-memories/3581950001/", "title": "Venice businesses turn fossils and sharks' teeth into lasting memories", "text": "VENICE – When Visit Sarasota County wants to differentiate south Sarasota County beaches from the rest of the state, they quickly point to the Venice area and the pastime of searching sand near the surf for fossilized shark teeth.\n\n“It’s very important,” Visit Sarasota Vice President Erin Duggan said. Many beach communities have fine restaurants, she said, but, “talking about the shark's tooth draw and Venice being the shark’s tooth capital of the world, it’s always given us something to differentiate us from other beach locations.”\n\nOn its web site, Visit Sarasota County points to the beaches from Casey Key south to Manasota Key as wonderful places to search for shark’s teeth, but south Brohard Beach and Caspersen Beach stand out for the sheer quantity of teeth – though shark tooth and fossil aficionados are quick to point out that prized large fossilized megalodon teeth are most frequently found by divers offshore.\n\n“I personally have met plenty of people on the beach and you can tell when you see somebody on the beach looking for shark’s teeth,” Venice MainStreet CEO Kara Morgan said. “They come to Venice specifically for that, it certainty plays into the town’s identity and is something of importance in terms of our character and charm and our culture, so to speak.”\n\nTeeth from Lemon and Bull sharks are what people scouring the shoreline most frequently find.\n\nTwo stores on the island of Venice – Earth Treasures at 207 W. Miami Ave. and Shark Frenzy at 262 S. Tamiami Trail – specialize in fossilized shark teeth and sell a variety of fossils to enthusiasts.\n\nVacation led to the perfect sifter\n\nBrittanie Hervas and her parents Roy and Linda are exactly the type of people Visit Sarasota likes to see frequent Venice area beaches.\n\nFor years, they traveled from Schaumberg, Illinois, to the Gulf Coast of Florida for vacation.\n\nThey started in Captiva then moved north to Venice, where they became fascinated by shark’s teeth.\n\n“For about 15 years we’ve been coming down to Venice, just vacationing down here,” Roy Hervas said. “When we came down here to look for sharks’ teeth, we felt there’s got to be more than a sand flea rake, and there wasn’t.”\n\nThe Hervases used resources at their snow plow shop in Schaumburg to create the Shark Tooth Sifter. Enough people asked about the hybrid shovel/sifter that Hervas decided to ask his brother, an attorney, to help draw up a patent.\n\nAfter selling the sifter through other shops, they opted to open Shark Frenzy in Dec. 2019.\n\nThe interior color scheme of their shop is aqua and purple, with a plentiful supply of Shark Tooth Sifters, as well as other similar devices that allow families to sift for shark’s teeth together, along with the requisite tourist trinkets, hats and souvenirs.\n\n“We want people to have the experience that we had when we first found shark’s teeth,” said Brittanie Hervas, who’s the face of the shop on an active social media presence that includes Facebook groups and TikTok.\n\n“I post my finds to let others see what we're finding at the beaches, and it starts the conversation,” Hervas said.\n\n“We want it to be an amazing, amazing time for them, we certainly fell in love with collecting sharks teeth, we know that’s something that’s amazing to do here in Venice,” she added.\n\nBrittanie Hervas notes that her main demographic is young and female – just as she was a young girl captivated by sharks’ teeth.\n\nFrom flea markets to Miami Avenue\n\nDon and Draeanne Rivette know all about the joy of collecting sharks teeth and fossils.\n\n“I like the sense of discovery, like customers do,” Don Rivette said. “It’s a very thrilling experience to look down and pick something up and then to realize it’s a part of an animal that has not existed on this earth for millions of years.”\n\nThe New England transplants started collecting and selling through flea markets seven years ago in Port Charlotte. They went on to their first shop in Englewood, before settling into their current location on Miami Avenue almost five years ago.\n\nOf course it hasn’t been easy going since the relocation. First it was Hurricane Irma, then red tide, followed by the reconstruction of Tampa, Venice and Miami Avenues by the city of Venice, and this year the COVID-19 pandemic that cut short the season..\n\n“We’ve seen a lot of stores go and by the grace of God, we’re still here,” said Draeanne Rivette, who can craft unique jewelry from the treasured finds customers bring in.\n\n“Fossils shells, sea glass, she can wire wrap any object,” Don Rivette said. “People have brought in stones that are important to them, that they want to remember a loved one.”\n\nOne customer came in five straight days with different finds from a fossil hunt with Don that she wanted turned into jewelry.\n\nWith the requisite model of a jaw of a 45-foot-long Megalodon, alligator heads, sculptures, and walls decorated by art available on consignment from a local dealer, Earth Treasures has an old Florida charm that comes with time.\n\nThe shop was featured on the PBS Fossil Hunters Mammoth Special from 2018, which is available in its entirety on YouTube.\n\nTo take advantage of the late-September off-season lull, the Rivettes were doing a little shop remodeling, including a rearranging of shelves, with white sea-foam accents being painted on the blue floor.\n\nThey’re planning to augment their web presence with a Google 360 tour of the store, so people can get a better sense of what’s inside.\n\n“We’ve tried to diversify to respond to customers' needs,” Rivette said. “We’re competing with them down the street and we are competing online.”\n\nOver the years, Don Rivette has befriended local archaeologists and can talk for hours on fossils of all sorts. Shark’s teeth, for many enthusiasts, are a gateway fossil.\n\nHe proudly points to a necklace Dreanne made from a Glyptodont scute – an armored plate from a long-extinct relative of the armadillo.\n\n“It’s an example of an ice age creature that a lot of people don’t know ever lived here,” he said, then continued to explain how it came up from South America through the isthmus of Panama some 50 centuries ago. “When you start looking for shark teeth, you find other things.”\n\nHe loves when people bring in items that he can help identify.\n\n“It opens up a whole other universe of exploration for people who love looking for shark teeth,” Rivette said. “I enjoy finding the fossils just as much as the shark teeth.”\n\nFor some people, that can lead to snorkeling or diving for larger pieces, or just walking the beach eyeing the sand for a prize.\n\n“You can use your hands and eyes or get all kinds of fancy equipment,” Rivette said.\n\nFor young children, he said, a household colander can work as a great entry into searching for fossils or shark’s teeth.\n\nFruits of an offshore ancient riverbed\n\nMost of the teeth on Caspersen Beach are from Lemon sharks. One shark, be noted, can make 45,000 teeth. Multiply that by the generations of sharks offshore and the variety of species – though the next most plentiful are bull sharks – and it’s easy to see why the local shores seem to boast an endless population of shark teeth and fossils.\n\nAn ancient river channel off the coast is a fertile source of fossils, Rivette said. Divers will search for finds there, while storms loosen material that eventually moves onshore with the wave action.\n\nMost of the teeth, both Don Rivette and Brittanie Hervas note, aren’t perfect, since teeth get damaged when they eat.\n\nLarger megalodon teeth Rivette said, can have blunt tips because the fish had such a powerful bite force to cut through the cartilage and vertebrae of whales.\n\nThough each shop has different aesthetics and they’re clearly in competition, the proprietors all pride themselves on providing hands-on customer service and understand that they’re offering both novice vacationers and returning hobbyists memories.\n\n“We sell an experience,” Brittanie Hervas said. “They’re going home with bags of teeth and that’s what they came here for.”\n\nDon Rivette said that some of the most memorable gifts they’ve made have been the finds of children who “worked hard to find shark teeth but they wanted to give them to their friend in school or ship them up to grandmom up north.\n\n“It’s wonderful to see how people give shark teeth and love to family members or friends.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/2021/06/21/glen-rose-texas-things-to-do-history-dinosaurs/7679142002/", "title": "Dinosaurs, pristine water, books and history in Glen Rose, Texas", "text": "GLEN ROSE — This historic Texas town's first tourist attractions were formed about 100 million years ago.\n\nSeveral types of dinosaurs left their huge tracks in the limestone beneath the often pristine Paluxy River, another longtime tourist attraction in these parts. Discovered in 1908 by Ernest \"Bull\" Adams, they were considered novelties until decades later, when layers of excavated tracks were sent to the American Museum of Natural History and Texas universities for further study.\n\nAt one point, local citizens carved human footprints into the same layer of limestone to suggest that people lived in the time of dinosaurs. Experts say they were either fake or from another time period.\n\nMore:Texas History: The Texas State Cemetery shapes its identity for 21st century\n\nThe real dinosaur tracks became part of the area's identity as \"Dinosaur Capital of Texas.\" You can spot the shapes of dinos almost everywhere, including in Dinosaur Valley State Park and the fanciful Dinosaur World roadside attraction. These spots compete — or complement, depending on your beliefs — with the nearby Creation Evidence Museum.\n\nIn Glen Rose, which includes the remains of petrified forests that decorate area buildings, it is perfectly OK to be a tourist. Unlike its neighbor, Granbury, it has not sprawled out. It remains a small, mostly walkable town of 2,500 folded into the canyon of the Paluxy River, one watery reason tourists have been drawn here to escape the heat of bigger cities during the summer.\n\nHistorical, not prehistorical Glen Rose\n\nWhile the evidence of dinosaurs remains a magnet, this valley has been inhabited for thousands of years for a variety of reasons. Tonkawas, Comanches and Caddos, driven out of East Texas, camped by its many springs. Ranches and farms arrived in the 1860s, especially attached to the grist mill built by Charles and Juana Cavasos Barnard directly on the Paluxy. This mighty stone building still stands, along with the adjacent cotton gin and a later sanitarium. Barnard's Mill now serves as one of the town's two main museums.\n\nCultivating cotton, once the primary cash crop, lasted only so long as Somervell County's hardscrabble soil held out. As early as the 1870s, medical tourists arrived to imbibe the mineral waters from a multiplying number of artesian wells. For that reason, the town, whose slogan once was \"Glen Rose for Health and Pleasure,\" was home to hotels, sanitariums, parks and tourist camps, quite a few of them still alluring for tourists and locals.\n\n\"Folks could stay in cabins and relax under under massive oaks, elms and pecans,\" writes Gene Fowler in the pictorial paperback, \"Glen Rose.\" \"Visiting Glen Rose for 'health and pleasure' indeed became a substantial part of the local economy.\"\n\nDuring the 1920s and early '30s, moonshine joined the mix, thanks to Prohibition. The rugged hills around Glen Rose — and the distances from bigger places such as Waco and Forth Worth — translated into another sobriquet, \"Moonshine Capital of Texas.\" In 1923, Texas Gov. Pat Neff sent the Texas Rangers with undercover officers into town to break up the business and 50 people were arrested. The town fought back.\n\nMy time in historic Glen Rose\n\nI arrived in Glen Rose on an early June Saturday morning via scenic U.S. 67 from Stephenville. After the heavy spring rains, the bluffs, valleys and meadows of this region radiated green. I pulled off the highway briefly to photograph the first petrified wood structure I encountered along the way, what looked like a former gas station turned into a residence or studio.\n\nI hung around the courthouse square, where a dinosaur track is on public display, and chatted with a woman selling sprigs of peppermint and other heady herbs at a farmer's market. A nearby truck advertised \"Eggs\" and \"Ammo.\" A morning walk took me through neighborhoods and parks along the river, which despite the swift current, looked inviting.\n\nNext up: Not one, but two unrelated historical museums.\n\nThe Somervell County Museum on the courthouse square is run by the amiable, alert and genuinely amusing Dennis Moore. I don't think I've ever encountered a better docent at a Texas historical museum. He has even discovered his own dinosaur tracks! Oftentimes, small local museums are packed with assorted historical treasures, but no one is available to explain them effectively or efficiently.\n\nNevertheless, the clearly well-informed Moore passed along a shady legend — shared with several Texas and Oklahoma towns — that stage actor and presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth not only escaped a barn fire and fatal gunshot wound, he lived for years as the mysterious John St. Helen. The legend differs from town to town — he's a teacher in some versions — but I don't know a serious historian who backs it.\n\nStill, don't miss this place, located in the rebuilt newspaper offices of the Glen Rose Herald, destroyed by a terrible 1902 tornado, or Barnard's Mill, found not far away on the banks of the Paluxy. Part of this complex serves as a museum of mostly Southwestern art, another is a transitional space that will soon house an exhibit on Comanche leader Quanah Parker. Yet the heart of the old mill with its massive timbers and ancient building techniques remains the main attraction.\n\nMore:Take your time at Texas State Cemetery, where history is written in marble\n\nThe shaded grounds are worth a stroll. Ann Carver, president of the Somervell History Foundation, was my guide here. She helpfully explained how the riverbed lay 25 feet below the mill's floor and that grinding was done on the second floor. The walls are 36 inches thick and, when the attached building was used for a hospital from 1936 to 1972, patients were lowered down into the mill's waterhole.\n\nBooks and brunch in downtown Granbury\n\nWhat a rapture, as an inveterate reader, bibliophile and history buff, to find three operating bookstores on or near the courthouse square in Glen Rose.\n\nRhythm & Co. Books focuses on new books. Its smallish Texas section is amazingly well curated. I felt like buying out owner Janet Mills' whole stock of Texana.\n\nBone-anza Barn: Books and Antiques is, as the name indicates, about older objects, a good number of them vintage books. I found some rarities here and the well-informed clerk also warned me about the pricing of a book, which I hadn't double-checked and was way out of my range. I also picked up some local petrified wood for $3.\n\nStoriebook Cafe started out primarily as a bookstore, but the soups and sandwiches that they offered on a limited basis were so good, it now serves three dining rooms and a patio. Owner Storie Sharp is a former newspaper reporter and editor — she wrote features for the Glen Rose Reporter, part of our Gannett / USA Today chain — and she's a firecracker. My sandwich of honey-baked ham and cheddar with chips and iced tea hit the spot.\n\nI could totally see renting a cabin for a week in this sweet town. Plenty to do and plenty of peace to do nothing.\n\nGlen Rose's bookstores\n\nThis small Texas tourist town is home to three very different bookstores located in and around the courthouse square: Storiebook Cafe, Rhythm & Co.

But overall, fishing had been slow, almost certainly a byproduct of the challenging and unstable weather conditions. The 20-foot Lund swerved through the swirling currents. McCarthy’s rod bowed and for an instant he suspected another hang up.\n\nThen the line moved. A bulldogged fight brought an arm’s length lake trout to hand.\n\n“How big, you think?” McCarthy asked, happily holding the salmonid with an Original Fish Grip tool made by his Jackson, Miss.-based employer.\n\nCapt. Joe Marra eyed the silvery and gray tinted fish.\n\n“About 9 pounds. Maybe 10.”\n\nWe had been employing a tried-and-true approach: drifting bait (minnows and trout egg) from three-way swivel rigs along the rocky riverbed through the churning, roiling, cross currents that define a 300-yard stretch of the Niagara River known as Devil’s Hole. The area is located about six miles below Niagara Falls and immediately upstream from the imposing Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station and its Canadian counterpart, the equally formidable Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station.\n\nMarra, who fishes about 70 days a year around his day job as an inventory manager for a regional beer distributorship, decided to change tactics. He exchanged the bait rods for long-lined, deep-running crank-bait rigs.\n\nTwo drifts. Two steelhead, the largest about 15 pounds.\n\n“That’s more like it,” said Marra, whose sunny, optimistic angling outlook came through even on the dreariest day.\n\nThe mighty Niagara\n\nThe Niagara River flows northward from Lake Erie for about 30 miles before emptying into Lake Ontario. It’s a powerful, productive and historic slice of water that forms the border between western New York and Ontario, Canada, and, of course, is primarily defined by the famous waterfalls that bear its name. But the river, along with the two Great Lakes that feed and receive it, form one of the most diverse and productive sport fisheries found anywhere.\n\nMarra has been fishing these waters all his life, as has Capt. Frank Campbell, who owns and operates Niagara Region Charter Service and for whom Marra occasionally guides. Both men view the river above and below the falls as separate fisheries, equally productive but markedly different.\n\n“Lake Erie and the upper river are generally thought of as a warm water, or cool water, species area and the lower river and Lake Ontario is more cold water species mixed with a few warm water species,” said Campbell, who has been guiding full-time on these waters for more than 20 years and enjoys a customer base that’s two generations deep.\n\n“In the lower river and (Lake) Ontario it’s predominately steelhead, brown trout and lake trout,” he said. “Also salmon. And we do have some of the warm water species; smallmouth bass, muskellunge, walleye and a few others.”\n\nFor anglers plying the upper Niagara and Lake Erie, the predominant sportfish are smallmouth bass, walleye and muskellunge.\n\nIt’s a combination that provides year-round action.\n\n“We fish for cold water species basically from November to the end of May and warm water species from May to November or December, depending on the weather,” Campbell said. “I really just like to fish and I’m kind of spoiled in that I can pick and choose what I want to fish for.”\n\nSo are his fishermen.\n\n“This was my first time to fish this area,” McCarthy, who is business development manger for Jackson, Miss.-based United Plastic Molders, said after the near hypothermic morning that yielded smallmouth bass, steelhead and lake trout from the same patch of water. “I wasn’t fully aware of the very fertile fishing grounds in this area.\n\n“But if you fish the Niagara, to enjoy this experience to the fullest, you should have an experienced guide that knows the quirks of the river,” he added. “It was crazy hooking that steelhead at Devil’s Hole and finally landing the fish as the boat spun like a top down at the power stations because of the strong currents. I couldn’t have done it without Capt. Joe.”\n\nThe wonders of Devil’s Hole\n\nDevil’s Hole is a stretch of the Niagara that’s as both as foreboding and tempting as its name. Difficult to reach and a challenge to fish, it can, depending on the season, serve up a smorgasbord of North American sportfish, a lineup that includes steelhead, salmon, lake trout, smallmouth bass, brown trout, an occasionally walleye and, rarely, a sturgeon. Double-digit weight fish are common.\n\nAt the cusp of the towering bluff is Devil’s Hole State Park, which includes a stairway that leads to the river’s edge, an access route for shore-bound anglers.\n\nBut it’s what you can’t see, according to Marra, that attracts the fish. Roughly 12,000 years ago, the falls were located here. In the ensuing centuries, they have eroded their way several miles upstream but the ancient footprint remains. This stretch of the riverbed is strewn with an unimaginable field of Ice Age-era boulders. It’s exactly they type of cover that attracts big, strong, brawny sportfish. It’s also a barrier to most boaters. Only shallow draft, jet boat-style rigs can navigate the shoals and surging whitewater above the hole.\n\n“The Devil’s Hole is one of the toughest places in the world you’re ever going to fish because of the bottom you’re dealing with,” said Marra. “And you’ve got to be near or on the bottom to catch fish.\n\n“But it’s a great fishery. And a year-round fishery,” he added. “It’s one of the few places where you can catch steelhead, brown trout, lake trout. And we have the (fall) salmon run. We also have a great smallmouth fishery. And we’ll get some walleyes. We do get some sturgeon in here, also, although they’re usually caught by mistake in the fall. But they are something to see.”\n\nIt isn’t, however, without risks.\n\nThe currents are always contentious, augmented and aggravated by fluctuating water releases from the twin power-generation stations.\n\nWater levels on the river also fluctuate, a byproduct of a water control system and an agreement that dates to 1950 that allows the American and Canadian power generation stations to divert water from the river above the falls into reservoirs. But that diversion stops at 9 a.m. daily, so the full force of the river can pour across the falls during the time of day when tourism peaks.\n\n“You really notice when they’re filling the reservoirs and not filling the reservoirs,” Marra explained. “They usually stop filling them at 9 (a.m.) because they want to show the falls in their full glory. So, when more water starts to come over the falls the water comes back up (downriver) and we usually get a bite going.”\n\nFishing can and often is phenomenal anytime but river and boating conditions are often tricky and occasionally treacherous.\n\nMarra advises caution and, at the risk of sounding self-serving, strongly cautions inexperienced boaters against plying these waters.\n\n“One thing (boaters) have to understand, especially in this Devil’s Hole area, is there are a lot of rocks and a lot of fluctuation in the water levels,” he said. “Until you come up here with a guide I really would not recommend someone trying it on their own. There’s just too much going on. There’s too much current. There’s too many things that can cause you problems.”\n\nCampbell agrees.\n\n“A guide is the shortcut. Not only to catching fish. But staying safe and learning the waters,” he said. “A lot of the ways people fish other areas just don’t work here. And vice versa. A lot of our techniques have been developed over time just for the river.”\n\nCatching local history\n\nEven fishing guides and charter captains can’t control the weather. The next morning dawned dry, mild and calm but thunderstorms and a small boat advisory were in the forecast. We climbed into Campbell’s boat and headed downriver and were soon fishing the fringe of Lake Ontario, just off the point where Fort Niagara still stands guard.\n\nThe fort, which was established by the French in 1726 following two previous efforts (1679 and 1687-88) to stake a foothold in what was then the Iroquois Confederacy, later flew British and American flags. It is one of the must-see area attractions.\n\n“Lewiston is a beautiful little town,” Campbell said after releasing the first of about two dozen smallmouth bass and one 20-pound lake trout that Charlie Puckett, Pat Duncan, Campbell and I caught and released before midday thunderstorms chased us back to the Lewiston Landing dock. “There is a lot of history in the area. The French and Indian War. The War of 1812. The Underground Railroad. The fort is something you don’t want to miss. And there’s also a lot of natural beauty. Hiking. Biking. Birding. And of course, Niagara Falls.”\n\nFor more information go to niagarafallsusa.com.\n\nContact Campbell at niagaracharter.com or 716-523-0013.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/10/07/report-america/3869291002/", "title": "Report for America", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY Opinion is partnering with The GroundTruth Project to publish essays written by Report for America corps members sharing their perspective on the communities where they live and report.

Bill Lee knows this, and his executive orders to stop the spread of COVID-19 reflect it: Churches are essential.\n\nIn any other time of crisis, there come the churches. They set up tents to care for the poor and comfort the sick. They are the ones leading marches. They mobilize recovery crews and organize community meals. But, as we all recognize, these are not normal times, and the institutions that hold together life in Chattanooga, and much of America, are searching for their footing during this pandemic.\n\nCoronavirus threatens people living in shelters. Here's how an agency rushed to save them.\n\nNEW HAVEN, Connecticut — Columbus House typically bustles with staff doing laundry and cleaning beds as volunteers prepare and plan meals for people who are homeless. When people in need arrived at the shelter in the late afternoon looking for dinner and a place to spend the night, they’d find food and a bed.\n\nNow, the shelter sits mostly empty. The lights are off and hallways are quiet as most of the staff work remotely during this pandemic. Their jobs now include racing to move an unprecedented number of people out of shelters and into alternate housing, including hotels, to avoid spreading the coronavirus among one of the most-at-risk populations.\n\nLife in Paradise: A deadly wildfire raged. Then the pandemic hit.\n\nCHICO, California — Business was finally picking up in Paradise, the Northern California town devastated 17 months ago by the deadliest, most destructive fire in the state's history. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\n\nButte County has seen few hospitalizations and no deaths from the coronavirus. But the crisis highlights the area’s health, social and economic vulnerabilities. The county has more people older than 65 than the state average, according to the 2019 Community Health Assessment, as well as slightly higher percentages of hypertension, kidney disease, pulmonary disease and asthma. The only hospital in Paradise closed because of damage from the Camp Fire, which killed at least 85 people and destroyed about 14,000 homes.\n\nChanges brought by the pandemic to daily life in Paradise have tested residents' hard-earned lessons on survival and resilience.\n\nIn California farm country, growers struggle with labor shortage\n\nAcross the nation, there is a tendency to reduce California to its economic heavyweights, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nBut in a state that extends more than 163,696 square miles, with a population pushing 40 million, there’s far more to life here than Hollywood or Silicon Valley. Each of California’s major regions — Southern California, the Inland Empire, the Central Valley, Bay Area, Northern California — carry their own identities, and their nuances are easily overlooked.\n\nIn rural Utah, local journalism shrinks as government controversies grow\n\nBLUFF, Utah — Drought maps of the southwestern United States looked like a target in 2018, dark red ringing a brown bulls eye. The center, indicating the most severely dry region, was on top of my home in San Juan County.\n\nSnow and rain that winter brought relief, but in May, the region began to slip back into drought. Where I live in Bluff, a tiny town along the northern edge of the Navajo Nation, there wasn’t a soaking rain all summer. Humidity was so low at times that when I pet my cat, we both got a static shock. My laying hens scratched around the yard, looking for insects that had long since disappeared.\n\nSan Juan is the largest county by geography in Utah and one of the largest in the nation. It fills in the entire southeast corner of the state, stretching from the Colorado River across tangles of canyons, bare mountain peaks and high farmland to the arid Navajo Nation and lands belonging to the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe.\n\nLife under a bridge: In California, children enduring homelessness face daily hardships\n\nMODESTO, Calif. — After a dip in the Tuolumne River, a 10-year-old girl who didn’t know how to swim but had no fear of the river chatted with her “street sister” in their invented language, crafted so they had something private in their otherwise exposed lives.\n\nThe July sun sizzled as the tent city approached 100 degrees, and with no breeze or electricity, a swim in the Tuolumne was their only relief. The two girls, who reverted to English when they wanted to discuss rap songs, school or surviving on the streets, were drenched from head to toe as they headed barefoot under the Ninth Street Bridge.\n\nFighting for health care: Rural America struggles with loss of doctors, clinics\n\nFAIRFIELD, Washington — Drive 20 minutes south of Spokane and pine trees give way to rolling hills, which in fall are golden with remnants of the wheat harvest and in winter dusted with snow. This part of eastern Washington state is the beginning of the Palouse region. Its small farm towns once thrived but now struggle to offer essential services such as health care.\n\nFor decades in Fairfield, residents received care from a doctor in a community clinic on Main Street. Alongside a post office, community center (which doubles as Town Hall), drug store, bank and library, a stucco building where the health clinic used to be sits vacant.\n\nLongtime Fairfield residents recall giving birth to their children at the clinic and visiting for regular checkups. But in 2019, after Kaiser Permanente acquired the health care group that operated the clinic, it closed and the doctor moved to Spokane, a 30-minute drive north.\n\nPoverty still plagues West Virginia, but signs of hope can be found\n\nCHARLESTON, West Virginia – Last June, I was dispatched home to West Virginia as a Report for America corps member to cover poverty for my hometown newspaper, the Charleston Gazette-Mail.\n\nOur corner of Appalachia is rooted in poverty — think black and white images of Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty.\" Today, West Virginia remains one of the poorest states in the country, where one in five children struggle to access food. The history and policy failures here — our vulnerable children, cyclically disadvantaged — are complex in a place where despair lingers in the damp air between rolling hills and in people who can’t “just pick up and leave,” as outsiders advise, or who simply object to doing so.\n\nThe story of West Virginia’s entrenched poverty is told in data points, which land the state at or near the top of ominous national rankings: worst health, worst education levels, worst employment. But it is often more nuanced than that. A puzzling factor of the state’s ailing economy, for example, are our rolling mountains, which isolate towns from sorely needed industry and internet access, especially in \"coal country\" in the southern part of the state.\n\nTo fight health disparities, Native Hawaiians return to their agriculture, wellness roots\n\nHONOLULU — Up Highway 93, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu's west coast, the crisp air and crystalline water beckon from Makaha Beach. Urban Honolulu and touristy Waikiki fade into the distance. Here, one can imagine an ancient Hawaii, of shores pocked with salt ponds and deep valleys flushed with kalo loi, or taro fields.\n\nCenturies ago, before the golf resorts, fast-food strip malls, dialysis centers and waste landfills, Oahu was divided into land slivers, called ahupuaa, which still mark the land from summit to shore. Native Hawaiians used the ahupuaa system — a socioeconomic, geographic and climatic subdivision of land — to sustainably source food in tune with the seasons, never taking too much, sharing with neighbors and caring for the earth in return for the bounty it provided, a traditional practice today’s locals are trying to revive and maintain.\n\nIn the Afro-Caribbean heart of Puerto Rico, locals fight erosion, government indifference\n\nLOÍZA, Puerto Rico — The waves crashed loudly on the collapsed ruins of the Paseo del Atlántico, a walkway that once partially protected residents here from the volatile ocean. Erosion along this northernmost coast of Puerto Rico, nearly 20 miles east of San Juan, precipitated the promenade's destruction for more than a decade and, in 2012, it finally fell into the Atlantic, exposing the Parcelas Suárez neighborhood to the water's edge.\n\nIts 1,560 locals now fear daily for their homes and lives.\n\nConnecticut's 'monument' to tough-on-crime era sits almost empty as justice reforms shine\n\nSOMERS, Conn. — It’s not the rows of barbed wire along the building’s exterior, nor the locked metal door at the entrance. It’s not the buzzer for requesting entry, nor the distinct lack of windows; not the guard at the entrance and not the metal detector. It’s the thick, stale air inside Northern Correctional Institution that cuts you off from the outside world. The trapped oxygen between its silvery, worn floors and ceilings, caught between narrow hallways and cinder-block walls, lock you in.\n\nThe prison is a “monument” to another era, when officials locked up the “worst of the worst,” Dan Barrett, American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut’s legal director told me during the course of my reporting on the facility. “I see Northern as the apex of a failed model.”\n\nI returned home to report on poverty in California. We're strained, but not broken.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. —The first thing locals mention are the homeless who line the streets of densely populated city blocks. They sleep restlessly in RVs; in vast encampments under the freeway; in tents in front of artisan coffee shops; on scraps of cardboard and discarded mattresses; on subway car seats that lurch from one end of town to another.\n\nThis is the Bay Area in 2020, infamous for its homelessness crisis and rising inequality, where the gulf between the rich and the poor can be seen every day on the street. Tents are propped up in front of swanky restaurants and boutique gyms; the impoverished pick through techies’ trash; misery laps up against luxury, all while the elements rage — fires, earthquakes, drought.\n\nHow many women in Puerto Rico must die before there's change? Women are done waiting.\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Women from multiple generations walked together late last year down trafficked avenues flanked by government buildings with a view of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSome held their daughters’ hands; others held signs reading, “Peace for all women” and “Justice, respect and equity.\" They joined others, many wearing purple as a symbol of resistance against patriarchy, transforming the marchers into a single color wave that descended onto San Juan. They chanted to demand a tally of how many women must be killed to cause an official acknowledgement, and reaction.\n\nReporting on climate change from Cape Cod, where sea levels could put everything at risk\n\nWOODS HOLE, Mass. — As you jog along the curving 3-mile road that leads down to the water on the southernmost tip of Cape Cod, you’ll pass five of the world’s leading marine and environmental institutions.\n\nYou’ll glimpse the solar arrays and wind turbine of the Woods Hole Research Center, where scientists and scholars study climate change and its impact around the world. You’ll wind your way past our local U.S. Geological Survey center, within the Quissett campus of the famed Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Just as you begin questioning why you started running in the first place, you’ll hit the Marine Biological Laboratory, a private nonprofit affiliated with 58 Nobel Prize winners since 1929. And finally, after passing exhausted doctoral students working in the coffee shop, you’ll reach the harbor by the national marine fisheries services.\n\nI grew up amid addiction, abuse. Now I report on similar stories so no one is forgotten.\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — In the nearly 2,300 miles between here and my hometown of Las Vegas are the stories of resilience I’ve always wanted to tell. They’re the stories of people who were brought to their knees by life and somehow got back up: childless mothers, traumatized veterans and sex abuse survivors.\n\nI cover mental health for a local cable news station in Buffalo, known in its glory days as \"Queen City,\" when it was the largest and most prosperous on the Great Lakes throughout the 19th century. To get here — now a glimmer of its former self, slowly recovering from decades of decay — my father and I drove from Las Vegas through the Rocky Mountains, and the Denver I knew a decade ago when I bounced among family members and watched as my biological mother battled her addiction and lost each time. I grew up in halfway houses and took beatings so bad, the bruises blossomed for months after the blows that caused them landed.\n\nHow wildfire victims are rekindling community a year after devastating, deadly Camp Fire\n\nPARADISE, Calif. — In October, hundreds more Californians joined the ranks of those who’ve lost homes and businesses to wildfire as hurricane-force winds blew flames through the vineyards of Sonoma County and the chaparral on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The news media told a story of grief and destruction. The coverage was dramatic enough that some have started questioning why people are living in California at all.\n\nA year ago, it was Paradise in the spotlight. On Nov. 8, 2018, fierce winds blew a spark from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. equipment into bone-dry trees, then pretty wooden homes throughout Paradise and other remote communities in Butte County. The resulting Camp Fire became the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, burning nearly 14,000 homes and killing 85 people.\n\nTeaching the blues to Mississippi Delta kids shows them they have a culture to be proud of\n\nGREENVILLE, Miss. — I recently moved to the heart and soul of the Mississippi Delta, the birthplace of the blues. Signs of this rich music heritage are all around me in this part of the state — the town where B.B. King was born, the railroad station where “Father of the Blues” W.C. Handy first heard the blues and, perhaps most famously, “The Crossroads.”\n\nThis crossroads is not just any intersection. Legend has it that blues musician Robert Johnson came to this place where Highway 61 and Highway 49 meet and sold his soul to the devil in order to play guitar — and that it inspired his famous song “Cross Road Blues.”\n\nKids, teens have their own stories to tell. Reporters like me should be ready to listen.\n\nMACON, Ga. — Jy’Nivea Troutman hides on the floor of her bedroom when she hears gunshots outside her window. That’s just what you do on Saturday nights in her neighborhood, she’ll tell you.\n\nBut Troutman, 16, would much rather talk to you about her school’s dress code. She thinks that her school’s policy is too strict — and that girls are more likely to be penalized for wearing what they love. She even made a 16-minute podcast episode about it.\n\nOut here in New Mexico, life and death flow at the pace of the vulnerable Rio Grande\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — El agua es la vida. Water is life.\n\nDoris Rhodes knows that mantra well. She inherited a riverside property from her father about an hour south of the city more than a decade ago. The land, in arid Socorro County, is nestled against the Rio Grande. Sprawling along 629 acres on the east side of the river, where there are no levees, it is one of the few wetlands in the area.\n\nMy print-only local newspaper won't chase Twitter likes, Google searches — just the story\n\nBUFFALO, Wyo. — The paper was late.\n\nNormally, the newest weekly edition of the Buffalo Bulletin hits our rack just before 1 p.m. on Wednesdays, driven 40 miles down Interstate 90 from the printer by a Bulletin employee.\n\nOur readers know the schedule, and Wednesday afternoons in the newsroom are regularly punctuated by the jangle of a large, brass cowbell hanging off the push-bar of our glass front door.

Now those trees have been ripped from the ground, leaving bare earth and dead stumps.\n\nGroundwater has been severely overpumped by farms in Morocco’s Souss-Massa region, and the water table has fallen dramatically. When the family’s well dried up, their farm was transformed into barren land.\n\nThe orange grove’s disappearance nearly five years ago eliminated the main source of income for Mbarek Belkadi, his three brothers, and their families. They’ve turned to whatever work they can find, often buying and selling fruit. Earning enough to survive has become a constant struggle.\n\n“All this land was irrigated with this well. Now it’s dead,” Mbarek said, standing beside piles of dry branches. “It’s finished here.”\n\nAs the family crowded around their old well, they pulled back the metal cover. A rusty cable lay in a heap next to it. This cable, they explained, was used to lower people into the hole to dig deeper. They dug down to more than 600 feet, and then gave up as the water level kept dropping. They could no longer afford a more powerful pump to lift the water from so far underground.\n\nAlongside farms that are still pumping from deep wells, many fields around the town of Sebt El Guerdane lie parched and abandoned. The faint patterns of ridges and furrows spread out across the soil, with only a stubble of weeds pushing through the hardened crust.\n\nThe overpumping of groundwater in this part of Morocco is symptomatic of a pervasive trend across North Africa and the Middle East. Much more water is being drained from the ground than is naturally recharged, and aquifers have been declining in countries from Tunisia to Iran to the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nNatural springs that once gushed into oases in the desert have dried up and disappeared in places across the region. As pumping has driven groundwater levels lower, some wells have been abandoned and farmlands have turned to dust.\n\n“In all these countries, groundwater is going down – no exception,” said Mohamed Aboufirass, a hydrogeologist who heads the Moroccan engineering consulting firm Resing. “We have to do something about it. And I think most of the governments in this region are aware of this. Morocco’s certainly is trying to.”\n\nIn fact, the Moroccan government has done more than most to combat its groundwater depletion problem. The government has invested in capturing more surface water and directing it to recharge aquifers. It’s promoting regional aquifer plans, charging many well owners based on how much they pump, and providing subsidies to encourage farmers to switch to water-saving irrigation systems.\n\nThe government helped back the construction of a water pipeline that carries water from dams to some of the citrus groves around Sebt El Guerdane. The distribution network from that pipeline, though, doesn’t reach Mbarek’s farm, so the family has been unable to buy the water.\n\nThey’ve managed to keep alive a couple rows of lemon trees using small amounts of water from the same municipal pipes that supply homes in the area. The lemon trees don’t produce nearly enough to support the family.\n\n“We are out hustling every day, trying to earn some money to bring it home,” Mbarek said. “But it’s always hard to find work because all the farmers around here have the same problem.”\n\nMorocco is a land of springs. Water that originates as rainfall and snow high in the Atlas Mountains filters down through fissures in the rocks and runs in streams, seeping into the aquifers of the lowlands.\n\nFarming towns have for generations depended on the streams gushing from the ground. But in the Souss-Massa plain, some springs have dwindled and stopped flowing. In farming villages near the town of Oulad Berhil, several water holes have vanished.\n\n“The springs were coming from there, where the palms are,” said a man who declined to give his name, motioning to date palms growing in a depression surrounded by plowed fields.\n\nDown a meandering dirt road, another dry spring has become a grassy pit filled with trash. It stopped flowing about 15 years ago.\n\nFor centuries, Moroccans dug underground irrigation tunnels called khettaras to capture and guide flows of groundwater to their fields. In many areas, the khettaras no longer flow and have been abandoned.\n\n“We used to get water from the spring on the mountain,” said Khadija Bouanek, a woman who was harvesting olives on the side of the road. “We used to go with mules to bring water for drinking.”\n\nSpeaking in Arabic through an interpreter, she explained that the spring went dry about a decade ago. That natural source of water was replaced with an artificial one when the government built a drinking water system that brings water from a well to people’s homes.\n\nIn parts of the Souss-Massa plain, groundwater levels have declined more than 200 feet, and that has had major consequences for farmers who have run out, said Nour-Eddine Laftouhi, a professor of hydrogeology at Cadi Ayyad University in Marrakech.\n\nMany rural people have been driven from their lands by the lack of water and have resettled in cities. Laftouhi said the entire country has seen “this phenomenon of migration from the rural areas to cities – because of water, because of drought, because of the depletion of water.” In places, he said, it’s because the springs that once sustained communities no longer exist.“In some areas of Morocco, it’s a very catastrophic situation,” Laftouhi said. “In some other regions, we have a rise up of the water level because of the introduction of irrigation systems, but this rise up of water level is not sufficient to balance, to counterbalance the depletion.”\n\nNear the western edge of the Sahara, the fertile alluvial plains at the base of the Atlas Mountains stretch out into some of the country’s most productive farmlands – greenhouses filled with tomatoes, fields of strings beans and olive trees.\n\nVast citrus groves produce navel and Valencia oranges, clementines and lemons. The fruit is sold in Russia, the Netherlands and other European countries, as well as the United States and Canada. Some of that fruit comes from the large groves around the towns of Sebt El Guerdane and Taroudant.\n\nAt one citrus grove, farmer Tarik Ait Hessi said he has access to water from the pipeline but prefers to pump water from wells because it’s less expensive.\n\n“We have to dig deep, like 250 meters underground, to find the water,” Ait Hessi said, standing beside the orange trees.\n\nOutside the walls of his orchard sits an abandoned farm. He said when the water level fell, the farm’s owners could not afford a new pump to draw water from such depths, so they left to look for work elsewhere.\n\n“Moving on is better than staying there and suffering,” Ait Hessi said.\n\nWhere the orchard used to stand, a lone tree remains in the field of barren furrows.\n\nAt Mbarek’s farm, the children used to help pick the oranges and lemons to sell. Now there’s relatively little work to do on the farm other than feeding the goats and three cows.\n\nHis 26-year-old nephew Mustafa found a job in construction. His 19-year-old nephew Khalid is working as an industrial electrician.\n\n“I want my kids to stay attached to the land and not sell it, to try to work the land even though it’s a hard time,” said Zahra Boulaich, Mbarek’s wife, whose youngest son is 14.\n\nMbarek explained that when the well first dried up, they dug deeper, about 30 feet at a time, until they reached more than 600 feet. Even then, they didn’t find water to pump.\n\n“I felt so sad when I had to take the trees from the ground, but I had to do it,” Mbarek said. After that, the brothers went to large farms to look for work. One of them started buying and selling fruit and vegetables.\n\nAs the family stood around the old well, Mustafa held up a broken piece of a mirror and reflected a shaft of sunlight down into the well. Other boys threw in rocks and listened to them ricochet off the walls until they hit the bottom with a faint thud.\n\n“There’s nothing to do here anymore,” said Abdel Kabir Belkadi, Mbarek’s brother.\n\nThe family owns another piece of farmland but has been renting it out because they don’t have enough money to invest. They tried to form a farming cooperative but couldn’t make it work.\n\nAcross the road, another farmer had just ripped out his orchard. The stumps has been sawed into pieces and lay in piles. Workers were loading the wood onto the back of a truck.\n\nThe dead trees are hauled out into the desert and left in mounds. Men shovel a layer of dirt atop the mounds and burn them, sending off smoke as the wood is turned into charcoal.\n\nAs groundwater has been depleted across the Middle East and North Africa, natural springs have gone dry in many places that were once desert oases. In a 2013 report published by the United Nations Development Program, researchers listed some of those lost springs – in Syria’s Palmyra oasis as well as springs in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Libya, western Egypt, southern Algeria and southern Tunisia.\n\nFarming consumes about 85 percent of the water that is used in Arab countries, and agricultural water use rose an estimated 32 percent in the region between 1995 and 2013, researcher Waleed Zubari of the Arabian Gulf University said in another report. He said much of the water that flows to farms is being wasted due to inefficient irrigation methods.\n\n“We have to practice agriculture wisely,” Zubari said. “We have to minimize the losses in agriculture.”\n\nHe and other scientists have warned that the region is vulnerable to climate change, which is increasing the pressures on water supplies in the same areas where aquifers are receding.\n\nAs water scarcity worsens, it threatens to limit countries’ development, shrink farming areas and contribute to the sorts of tensions that have already erupted into conflicts in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.\n\n“I think the worst-case scenario is already playing out in the Middle East, in Syria,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies groundwater depletion around the world using satellite measurements. Famiglietti, who is also the senior water scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, pointed out that while the war in Syria is about much more than water, the tensions that led up to it were aggravated by severe drought, declines in groundwater and the government’s failure to provide water for agriculture. Many farmers were forced to abandon their lands and move to cities, and resentment festered.\n\nUsing measurements from NASA’s GRACE satellites, a team including Katalyn Voss, Famiglietti and other scientists found that the north-central Middle East encompassing the Tigris-Euphrates region lost about 144 cubic kilometers of freshwater – an amount comparable to the Dead Sea – between 2003 and 2009.\n\nThey estimated that 60 percent of those water losses in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran were due to groundwater depletion, largely water pumped from wells for farms. Turkey has also been holding back water in massive reservoirs, reducing the flows in rivers and contributing to falling groundwater levels downstream.\n\nThe satellite data also reveal enormous losses of groundwater beneath the Arabian Peninsula and across the Sahara, where Algeria, Libya and Tunisia are drawing down their aquifers.\n\nMany of the countries in North Africa and the Middle East rely on “fossil” aquifers that contain water deposited long ago when the climate was wetter. Scientists have estimated that water pumped from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System in western Egypt has been underground for ages ranging from hundreds of thousands of years to more than a million years. As that water is drained from the ground, the aquifer is irreversibly diminished.\n\nIn places, those changes are visible aboveground as lakes recede. Lake Urmia in western Iran, for instance, has shrunk dramatically, mainly due to diversions of surface water but also due partly to groundwater depletion. In Ethiopia, Lake Haramaya has mostly dried up, and researchers say its decline was partly caused by groundwater pumping for the thirsty crop khat, a leafy plant that people chew as a stimulant in parts of East Africa and Yemen.\n\nTracing exactly how tensions over water contribute to larger conflicts can be difficult. But falling groundwater levels are a major problem in some of the same countries where conflicts are raging, including Yemen. There, khat farms have long been draining groundwater, and water tables have fallen to perilous lows.\n\n“We don’t see wars over water. But what we see is water is a contributing factor to conflicts that may start for another reason. They may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” said Peter Gleick, a water researcher who is president of the Pacific Institute and has studied how drought and mismanagement of water contributed to the conflict in Syria.\n\nHis organization keeps a detailed chronology of water-related conflicts around the world. In 2014, the incidents ranged from deadly protests over water shortages in South Africa to clashes over land and water sources pitting herders against farmers in Nigeria.\n\n“Conflicts over water turn violent when institutions fail,” Gleick said. “That’s one of the reasons in fact why more and more of the water conflicts we’ve seen in recent years have been sub-national conflicts and not between nations, because nations have diplomats, nations negotiate treaties, nations go to war only as a last resort. But ethnic groups, communities are much more likely to resort to violence if they feel they have no other recourse.”\n\nSome conflicts can simmer for years when groups of farmers or towns argue over water.\n\nIn Morocco, the village of Assads has a longstanding grievance with farmers who divert water from a spring upstream. The town’s mosque stands high above a dry riverbed in a valley where the mountains rise from the Souss-Massa plain. All around Assads, old irrigation canals are dry and strewn with rocks.\n\nTerraced fields have been abandoned, leaving them dotted with the dry stumps of dead date palm trees.\n\nYazid Nait, who grew up in the town, said he remembers there used to be plenty of water to grow grapes and other crops. Then a longstanding water-sharing agreement between the villages broke down.\n\n“They take all the water,” Nait said of the farmers upstream. He said that without water, his village has withered and many people have moved away.\n\nNait, who now lives in the United States and was back home for a visit, set out on foot for the spring, hiking through a deep canyon where seasonal downpours have sculpted the steep rock walls in smooth, undulating patterns. He passed citron farms on the hillsides where the canals were brimming with water and croaking frogs.\n\nAt the spring, the water gushed from a cavernous opening in the rocks into a dammed pool. Nait squatted down and splashed the cool water with a hand.\n\n“It’s pure water,” he said. “We need somebody to manage it well and give it to the other people. That’s it.”\n\nLarge-scale acquisitions of farmland are on the rise, and many land deals are occurring in Africa as agribusiness companies and other foreign investors move in to secure land with ample water supplies.\n\nThose deals are being tracked by researchers through an initiative called Land Matrix, a database that shows substantial and growing investments in Africa.\n\nSaudi Arabian, Indian and Chinese companies have acquired farmlands in Sudan. Companies from Portugal and the United Arab Emirates have started farming operations in Egypt. And companies from Israel, Austria, Turkey and other countries have signed deals for land in Ethiopia.\n\nSome researchers have labeled it “water grabbing” and have sought to quantify the amounts of water involved. Others have raised concerns about how rural communities will be affected as large companies move in and pump water to their fields.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government has been promoting increased tapping of groundwater to boost food production. Seifu Kebede, a water scientist at Addis Ababa University, said less than 75,000 acres are irrigated with groundwater today and the government plans to increase that to nearly 5 million acres.\n\nIf the groundwater boom goes unregulated, Ethiopia will face some of the same pitfalls that other countries are grappling with, Kebede said. He cited severe depletion problems in India and parts of the United States such as California.\n\n“So there should be a balance, some level of regulation,” he said.\n\nIn a 2012 report published by the Rome-based International Land Coalition, a team of researchers concluded that Africa has become a prime target of investment in the land rush and that the “rights and livelihoods of rural communities are being put in jeopardy by the prevailing model of large-scale land acquisition.”\n\nThey called for governments and investors to not only recognize the land and water rights of small farmers but to also provide them with assistance and financing. They recommended “enforceable limits” on the extraction of water based on assessments of how much can be used sustainably.\n\nThat didn’t happen around Sebt El Guerdane, where small farmers were put out of business while big farms continued pumping.\n\nDown the road from Mbarek and Zahra’s farm, neighbor Ibrahim Akroud said that since his well ran dry, he has been hiring out his tractor for jobs on large farms.\n\n“Everybody is out of work in this area,” he said, sitting on his tractor. “And those who are left don’t have money and are hoping for better days.”\n\nElsewhere, near Taroudant, the government has helped small farmers by drilling deep wells that supply their fields. Mohamed Amine El Khesoini said he and his family used to struggle to find enough water to farm, but those problems went away when the government drilled the wells two years ago. A cooperative administers the wells and charges farmers for the water they use.\n\n“Everybody prefers to be on the government infrastructure,” El Khesoini said. His family sells their turnips and other vegetables at the weekly souk, where farmers spread out their produce on tables along with boxes of dates and bags of spices.\n\nAnother government program supports farmers with subsidies, paying those with small landholdings up to 100 percent of the cost of switching to drip irrigation or other efficient systems.\n\nSome large farms are also adopting more efficient irrigation systems out of necessity in order to control pumping costs and keep their wells running.\n\nAt one orange grove near Taroudant, manager Abdel Majid Etaouil said the farm already uses drip irrigation and is starting to experiment with underground tubing that sends water directly to the roots.\n\nStanding next to the farm’s irrigation pond, he said the groundwater has declined and the farm’s pump had to be lowered deeper into the well.\n\n“The big change was these last six months,” he said. If the water table keeps falling, they will soon have to drill deeper.\n\nMorocco has about 135 dams. Most of them were built during the rule of King Hassan II from 1961 to 1999, when the government’s water policies were focused largely on expanding the country’s water storage capacity and bringing drinking water to more Moroccans.\n\nIn the latter part of his rule, the government’s emphasis began to shift toward managing water supplies. A national water law passed in 1995 created river basin agencies and gave them responsibility for developing water management plans and monitoring groundwater use, among other tasks.\n\nBecause much more groundwater is being pumped than can naturally be recharged, the Souss-Massa river basin agency has a long-term plan to bring that deficit into balance, said Hamza El Himri, head of the agency’s sustainable water management division. “We’re trying to make up for this deficit and keep underground resources as strategic sources.”\n\nHe said the plan is based on halting the expansion of irrigated land, promoting conservation and moving toward the use of more treated wastewater and desalinated water.\n\nThe government is backing the construction of a desalination plant in Chtouka that will draw in seawater from the Atlantic and churn out water for agriculture – more than 100,000 cubic meters per day, or 26 million gallons. The aquifer has fallen nearly 100 feet beneath farms in Chtouka, and the area is in danger of losing its water supply due to saltwater intrusion. The desalination plant is intended to keep lucrative greenhouses in business and, at a cost, lessen the strains on the aquifer.\n\nThe Moroccan government, both under Hassan II and now under King Mohammed VI, has declared groundwater to be a strategic resource. In its national water strategy, the government lists the preservation of groundwater as a priority and calls for the reduction of pumping from overexploited aquifers. The document also emphasizes “participation, involvement and accountability” in managing groundwater.\n\nGovernment officials acknowledge that some of their efforts have failed and that a great deal more needs to be done. Abdeslam Ziyad, the national director of water research and planning, said most of the country’s aquifers are still being overexploited and attempts at controls have been ineffective. So the government is instead promoting an approach that involves engaging farmers and other water users and having them participate in deciding how to address the problem. They are working on regional plans called aquifer “contracts,” in which government officials and water users meet to diagnose the issues facing their aquifers and then agree collectively on actions to take.\n\n“There are solutions, but to succeed with this proposition, you cannot be too ambitious with the contracts,” Ziyad said. “We must be modest, and not have too many objectives.”\n\nIn the first attempts at contracts, it became clear that for farmers and others to meet the goals of reducing pumping, the bar couldn’t be set too high, Ziyad said. “The most important thing is to stop the hemorrhaging, not to continue with the same trend of overexploitation.”\n\nHe said the government is focusing on projects to artificially recharge aquifers by capturing surface water and directing it to areas where aquifers are depleted. But that has a relatively small impact and raising groundwater levels can take many years. So he said the government’s strategy emphasizes limiting pumping through the contracts, which are signed by participants once they are finalized.\n\nEven with those agreements, the challenges are monumental, especially because large farms have the ability to keep pumping while small farmers often don’t.\n\n“That is the big problem with groundwater resources: if we do not exploit this resource, there are neighbors who will exploit it,” Ziyad said. “And so it is a race for exploitation.”\n\nWhile trying to raise awareness, water regulators don’t plan to give up on enforcement. They are developing a monitoring system that uses satellite images to track any expansion of farmland. If an area that was previously brown turns green in the satellite images, they will be able to crack down on violators that are pumping more without permission.\n\nMuch of Morocco’s export crops are grown in the Souss-Massa region, where agriculture accounts for about 90 percent of the water consumption.\n\nThere are more than 25,000 wells in operation, and that’s only the number with permits, said Lhoussaine Bouchaou, a hydrogeologist at Ibn Zohr University in Agadir. He said many other wells have been drilled illegally and the groundwater has been so severely depleted that recharging the system would take a very long time.\n\nHe and other experts say the country has made significant progress. Aboufirass, whose consulting firm deals with water management, said the advantage of using aquifer contracts is that all parties are involved in the diagnosis and there is buy-in to work toward objectives.\n\nHe said government subsidies are also helping more farmers switch to drip irrigation.\n\n“If we save let’s say 10 percent by bringing drip irrigation, or 20 percent, that’s like building a dam,” Aboufirass said. “So we are in the learning curve, but I think we are getting somewhere.”\n\nMore still needs to be done to encourage farmers to install new irrigation systems and switch to crops that use less water, said Laila Mandi, director of the National Research Center on Water and Energy at Cadi Ayyad University. She said the river basin agencies also need more funding and staff to effectively enforce limits on pumping.\n\n“Everything must be changed to cope with this problem and to stop this,” Mandi said. “We have to preserve these resources for the future.”\n\nMorocco’s struggles mirror problems of declining aquifers around the world.\n\nMost aquifers are poorly monitored and poorly managed, so improving monitoring is one of the first steps that needs to be taken, Famiglietti said. He said there is tremendous potential for improving efficiency in agriculture.\n\n“We need to be thinking about more judicious crop choices, growing the right things in the right places,” Famiglietti said. “We need to be thinking about water pricing and charging the true value for water.”\n\nIf the world doesn’t take action to change course, he said, the results will be abysmal. More farmers are likely to be displaced. Depletion could lead to the collapse of farming regions. Water could become a source of greater conflict.\n\nIn many areas, the quantities of water that can be tapped haven’t been well studied. Famiglietti said that means people are “flying blind, and that is incredibly risky.”\n\nHe called for exploration of the world’s major aquifers and said the United States ought to have a coordinated national water plan.\n\n“I think one of the biggest things that has to happen is that people, the general population needs to really take ownership of this problem, really understand how heavily we rely on groundwater and really push for its sustainability over the long-term,” Famiglietti said. “It’s a very challenging problem because we’re basically addicted to groundwater and there is no one there to help. Globally, there’s no one there to help wean us off the groundwater.”\n\nFamiglietti said one of the biggest hurdles to addressing groundwater depletion problems on a global scale is the lack of a body where scientists and others can work on solutions.\n\nFamiglietti suggested creating a coordinated global conversation about water – a body that would parallel the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the equivalent of a Kyoto Protocol for water.\n\nIt may be just a matter of time, he said, until the world needs to hold its first global summit on groundwater.\n\nThis special report was produced with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2016/09/08/newest-national-park-service-sites/90066458/", "title": "Protected lands: The National Park Service's newest sites", "text": "Tracy L.

Other sites run by the National Park Service are more modest, provoking curiosity and reflection about our country’s past. Our newest protected spots tend to fall more into the latter category.\n\nKatahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, Maine: The newest addition to the National Park System, Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument is a 87,500-acre expanse of the Maine North Woods donated by the founder of Burt’s Bees. The rugged wilderness that inspired Henry David Thoreau, John James Audubon and Teddy Roosevelt offers spectacular vistas with views of Mount Katahdin, Maine’s highest peak. Paddlers revel on the whitewater streams and quiet lakes, while the dark night skies are ideal for stargazing, with occasional displays of the aurora borealis. The park is home to abundant wildlife including moose, black bear, white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, American marten, bobcat and the federally threatened Canada lynx.\n\nKatahdin, which is already open to the public, offers a contrast to Acadia National Park, a two-hour drive to the east, said Christina Marts, community planner for the new monument. “Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument captures the unique culture and ecology of the north woods in Maine, a very different experience than the coastal environment and history of Acadia,” she said. Visitor amenities are still in the planning phases but some basic facilities are in place. There is limited cell service in the area, so visitors are advised to come prepared for a true wilderness experience.\n\nNew national monument won't settle Maine's north woods debate\n\nPullman National Monument, Chicago, Ill.: More than once in its 150-year history, this model community became a battleground for what remains some of the most heated issues of the day: labor relations, race relations and income inequality. Today those who administer it hope that it can be a place that fosters understanding. Highlights include monthly walking tours (the first Sunday of the month), and a new train service from downtown Chicago, with rangers meeting visitors on the platform. “They’ll be traveling on the same right-of-way that Abe Lincoln’s body came in on in the funeral train,” said Michael Shymanski of the Historic Pullman Foundation. “When it left for Springfield, it had a Pullman car attached.”\n\nValles Caldera National Preserve, N.M.: 150 years may seem like a long time until you contemplate the history of this ancient landscape in the Jemez Mountains. Formed by the collapse of a vast supervolcano more than a million years ago – hence the name “caldera,” or crater – Valles Caldera has been home to human beings for at least 11,000 years. The 89,000-acre former ranch, habitat for elk, cougar, deer, prairie dogs, and much more, is new in the administrative sense only; acquired by the federal government as a preserve and working ranch in 2000, access was limited until 2013. Now it has quickly become a favorite destination of cross-country skiers, hikers, anglers, equestrians, mountain bikers and nature-lovers of all kinds, and with the transfer to the National Park Service, will undoubtedly acquire an even larger following.\n\nWaco Mammoth National Monument, Waco, Texas: Sometime in the Ice Age, a cataclysmic event – perhaps a flash flood – trapped a nursery herd of Columbian mammoths grazing along the Bosque River. Fast-forward 70,000 years, when a couple of hikers were wandering along the riverbed and spied a large bone jutting out of a ravine. They dug it out and presented it to researchers at Baylor University. The four-decade paleontological project that ensued has revealed 24 of the massive beasts and a host of other Pleistocene-era creatures, and a dig shelter displaying the remains of six mammoths in-situ – that is, in the ground where they were found. So people get to see a real dig site, just with the benefit of air-conditioning.\n\nTule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nev.: Another window onto the Paleolithic era can be found just a half-hour north of the neon lights of Las Vegas. Scattered about a 22,650-acre expanse of desert is a collection of fossilized remains spanning two Ice Ages – 250,000 years, unlike the Waco Mammoth site and other fossil beds. Here lie the remains of thousands of ancient mammoths, camelops (a larger relative of today’s camel), American lions (huge cats weighing up to 1,100 pounds) and sloths the size of grizzly bears. Paleontologists have found the remains of at least three species of wild horse, the dire wolf, saber tooth cats and even llamas, as well as mammoth tusks as tall as a man.\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, during what’s known as the “Big Dig,” giant equipment, funded in part by the Las Vegas casinos, dug a series of long trenches to break loose some of the fossils, looking for evidence of human remains. None were found, and the dig was abandoned – until years later, when the site was mapped and slated for development. A citizens group under the banner Protectors of Tule Springs realized what was at stake, got organized and lobbied to protect the site.\n\nHiking along the trenches can yield ancient discoveries – but take only photos, as all fossils must remain in place. Come prepared to “rough it” as there are no facilities and not much signage, but if you’re interested in paleontology, geology or even the peaceful desert landscape, you’ll enjoy a trip to this rare place. Hike early to avoid the brutal heat or come in the fall, when it cools down, and check the Facebook page to see what sorts of activities the park staff is organizing in other venues. A visitors center is in the works, but until then they are pushing the idea of “virtual visits” and taking the park to the community.\n\nNational Park Service: 10 hidden gems that deserve a visit\n\nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, Mass. and R.I.: Like the Pullman National Monument, this new park highlights a much more recent period in history, the dawning of the industrial age. Unlike Pullman, however, Blackstone was born out of an existing National Heritage Corridor. That corridor is a sprawling complex of 24 towns, a river and a canal that encompasses a variety of landscapes and a window into the natural and industrial history of the region. Blackstone is by far the most developed of the new national parks, with seven visitors centers to help travelers sort out their options.\n\nPlans foresee the National Historical Park being composed of six distinct nodes: the Slater Mill in Pawtucket, site of the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in North America; Blackstone River State Park; the mill villages of Ashton and Slatersville in Rhode Island; Whitinsville, once the nation’s largest manufacturer of textile machinery, and Hopedale in Massachusetts.\n\nIf it’s nature you’re looking for, you’ll find plenty of that, as well; the park also includes the Blackstone River and Canal and its tributaries. The Blackstone River is a playground for canoeists and kayakers, meandering 46 miles from Worcester, Mass., to Providence, R.I., flowing through cities, quaint villages, farmlands, and forests. The Blackstone River Bikeway will also eventually extend 48 miles from Worcester to Providence; currently, about 20 miles of trail are open. So don’t miss a chance to pedal – or paddle – your way through a fascinating slice of New England’s past. But you can begin exploring the history of the park and corridor without leaving your home, as the National Park Service has posted hours of interpretive videos to share some of the many stories of the region, from the underground railroad to the women’s rights movement to the Nipmuc people who originally inhabited these lands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/01/droughts-human-caused-global-warming-have-worsened-dry-times/3643819002/", "title": "Droughts: Human-caused global warming have worsened dry times", "text": "Tree ring data can be used to find droughts as far back as 1400.\n\nGreenhouse gases caused by humans have been affecting global drought since the early 20th century.\n\nLead author Kate Marvel, a climate modeler at Goddard and Columbia, said, “It’s mind boggling.\"\n\nThe secret was in the trees.\n\nLooking at tree rings from ancient trees, scientists in a new study say they've finally found the fingerprint of human-caused global warming on drought and rainfall patterns worldwide from as far back as 1900.\n\nAmazingly, tree ring data is an accurate gauge to determine past climates: The rings are thinner in years when it's dry and may not grow at all in stressful conditions like drought.\n\nIn fact, researchers can use tree ring data to \"find\" droughts as far back as 1400, centuries before reliable weather data was available.\n\nAccording to NASA, \"we now know that greenhouse gases caused by humans have been affecting global drought since the early 20th century.\"\n\nClimate change, aka global warming, occurs because fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal are burned to power our world. This burning process releases carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into our atmosphere.\n\n\"The big thing we learned is that climate change started affecting global patterns of drought in the early 20th century,\" said study co-author Benjamin Cook of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"We expect this pattern to keep emerging as climate change continues.\"\n\nThis is the first study to provide historical evidence connecting human-generated emissions and drought at near-global scales between 1900 and 2005.\n\nLead author Kate Marvel, a climate modeler at Goddard and Columbia University, said, “It’s mind boggling. There is a really clear signal of the effects of human greenhouse gases on the hydroclimate.”\n\nIt's also the first time researchers have identified long-term global effects on the water supplies for crops and cities around the Earth.\n\nIn a warming world, some regions are expected to get drier, while others will get wetter. The study suggests this pattern will continue:\n\n\"All the models are projecting that you should see unprecedented drying soon, in a lot of places,” Marvel said.\n\nMany of the areas expected to dry out are centers of farming, and could become permanently arid. “The human consequences of this, particularly drying over large parts of North America and Eurasia, will likely be severe,” the study said.\n\nThe study was published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/desert-magazine/2019/08/20/california-desert-artists-offer-poetry-prose-essays-beauty/1842913001/", "title": "California desert artists offer poetry, prose, essays on beauty", "text": "There’s beauty to be found in the California desert.\n\nI’ve learned to predict the best sunsets by the number of clouds in the sky. The fewer there are, the less sorbet streaks across the horizon.\n\nSo, when dusk settles in amid myriad white puffs, I jump in my car with my camera to race the sun to the West.\n\nJagged peaks line the distance as I wind around bends and turn down the static that blares from the radio. Boulders stand stoic in spite of their imperfections. Sometimes, I pull over to capture the beams of light illuminating their crooked edges. And still the sun sets.\n\nHere’s the thing about this journey – there is no destination. When the golden moment comes, I pull into a ditch on the side of the road and venture out to find Joshua trees forming black silhouettes against the watercolors seeping upwards into the sky. My shutter flits to preserve the instant before it’s gone, but more often than not, I find myself kneeling down in the dirt to take in the sight without the lens. There’s something wild about reveling in the nip of wayward winds as the sun melts into the horizon.\n\nPoet Arthur Chapman once wrote, “Out where the world is in the making, where fewer hearts in despair are aching, that’s where the West begins.”\n\nWherever you are in the desert, you can watch dusk fade into dust.\n\nFor centuries, locals and visitors alike have searched these peaks and valleys.

Since September 2016, DESERT magazine has published responses submitted by artists from Palm Springs to Joshua Tree and beyond.\n\nThese are “the ways in which we seek – and find – beauty in the desert.”\n\nHere’s to simply showing up.\n\nKristin Scharkey, Editor\n\nkscharkey@gannett.com\n\nIt’s 1980 and I’m 9 years old, walking down Palm Canyon at dusk with my grandfather. He’ll only live another five years. A heart attack will kill him – his fourth, or maybe his third, since I’m not sure if the story of him having a heart attack while catching a marlin is actually true – so this is borrowed time, which is probably why he’s smoking a cigar. “Don’t tell your nana,” he says, lighting up.\n\nIt’s fall and everything is reddish-gold: gaudy baubles in their jewelry store display cases. Brake lights from cruising Cadillacs refracting out from store windows, painting the sidewalk brilliant. Even Morrie Geyer – proprietor of Morrie Geyer Menswear, standing outside his shop in a scalloped shirt opened halfway to his belly-button, his tan chest exposed – seems to glow. Or maybe that’s the life-sized mannequin of Morrie. It’s hard to remember the difference all these years later. You ever saw a person standing next to a mannequin of themselves, well, it distorts reality.\n\n“Have you heard from your dad?” my grandfather asks. I tell him I haven’t. He takes a puff from his cigar, let’s it go from his mouth. “When was the last time?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I say. “My birthday?”\n\nWe linger in front of See’s Candies, across the street from Bullock’s. The sweet smell of chocolate and confection rises around us, but then it’s been like that the entire time we’ve been walking, Palm Canyon seemingly filled with candy stores, men in the front windows spreading out fudge, their aprons smeared. Teenage girls stepping out to give you a sample, and it’s like magic, candy from nowhere, and free.\n\n“Well,” my grandfather says, “I’m right here. If you want to talk about something, just talk about it with me.” He gazes down, forces a smile, which makes him look like my mom. They have the same lips. This morning they got into a screaming fight, she stormed out of the condo, spent the day by the pool, smoking, my grandfather’s last words hanging between them: If I gave you a dime, you’d spend a dollar. “You understand? Man-to-man, Man.” A pause, the street moving fast around us now, lights, snippets of conversations, the roar of a muscle car, a breeze that feels like winter ... or maybe none of these things, just a boy and an old man on the street. “We should get some lollipops,” he says, and we go into the store. “Get whatever you want and whatever your sister would want. Buy the whole store if you want.”\n\nHere’s the thing about beauty: It doesn’t need to be physical. It doesn’t even need to be emotional. It can be a moment of simple kindness that you forget about entirely, until one day you’re stopped on Palm Canyon, a street you hardly drive down anymore, because you live across town.\n\nYou know how that goes.\n\nYou hardly get west of Bob Hope during season.\n\nYou look at the people crowding the sidewalk, something to watch while you wait for the light to change. To get on with your life. Get off this street. All this traffic. All these tourists. But then you see a boy in front of See’s and you remember yourself, standing right there, so long ago that you’re closer in age today to your grandfather than your childhood self. And it’s all you can do not to run out into the street to find your grandfather, too. To tell him you heard him, that you still hear him, on beautiful fall days, at dusk, in the smoke of a stranger’s cigar, always when you least expect it, like driving through the city of your past or waiting for some distant golden future.\n\nTod Goldberg is the New York Times best-selling author of more than a dozen books, including the novels “The House of Secrets,” which he co-authored with New York Times best-selling author Brad Meltzer and “Gangsterland,” a Hammett Prize finalist.

Not the chosen solitude where it’s 78 degrees at the start of summer, the air is perfect, the sun a soft lemon. It’s the kind of solitude that leaves you stranded. The air is heavy and the rain hasn’t lifted for days. The streets, which in a different light run silver, today are rivers of mud and all is a murk of gray. A lingering rain has soaked the fire logs. They burn smoke. There are four cartons of eggs in the refrigerator, half expired, along with a bag of old apples.\n\nOn days like this I would drive. But I’ve been without my pickup truck, a winter heartbreak. The drive would lift the solitude, the unchosen kind. It’s a freedom unmeasured. And one unmeasured freedom I’ll share with you. There’s a lookout on the 15, high in the San Bernardino Forest. In the valley below, a freight train comes through, diverting and romantic. The first time I saw it I pulled over. The train was long and winding and rolled cautiously downward. I watched and thought of its countless journeys, each a tale. The moon shone bright on the valley and I, a speck in those mountains all around me, wanted to throw my hands up and be lifted like a child. The train vanished into cottoned layers of fog. It was time to go home. I took the backroads to Highway 247 and then through Johnson Valley.\n\nEach time I’d drive to the outlook to see the train in the valley, it would somehow be there faithfully, a familiar anticipation, the kind that fulfills a seeking heart. It made my heart remember an anticipation of a different kind. A time I put on a dress and a faux fur stole and went out to a concert hall to hear the strings, at the hopes a companion might be there, and he was, on the other side of the crowd waiting for me.\n\nAnd what else is beauty but an anticipation, a symphony in our hearts.\n\nOn this morning, the morning of expired apples and mud rivers, sometime around three o’clock in a dream, a train appeared at my door hovering in its own steam. I heard the gardenia branches thrashing against my window and saw the train waiting there. It was a lustrous black metal, with passenger benches of shining leather.\n\nI was tired and disoriented. I got out of bed, my feet cold on the winter floor. Putting on my hooded robe draped over the bedpost, I walked through the door and stepped onto the train. We glided past the creosote bushes through the desert down through Morongo Valley and up to Tahquitz Peak where I stepped off, and walked through the pines, kindling under my bare feet. I turned to see if the train was still there. And perhaps I awoke.\n\nRecovering from illness at her mother’s farmhouse in Pennsylvania in 2012, Mercy read the Hemingway letters.

It took 25 years of living in the Coachella Valley for me to be drawn into the mystic, spiritual beauty of the desert landscape.\n\nThe awakening was more than what my eyes could see. It was an out of body experience, a feeling that hit an emotional nerve, like a familiar song on the radio that brings back good childhood memories. I felt sensitive and emotional, and I silently cried.\n\nIt began in the summer of 2017, assigned to an investigative story in Joshua Tree. Missing hikers. The twists and turns, like a Law & Order episode, were constant. I was in the high desert for secret meetings and interviews, early mornings, and weekends. My seasoned reporter instincts kept me coming back for more. Or, was it the need to see the high desert sunrise? The calm across the desert? The individual Joshua trees backlit by the perfect light of the rising sun? Breathtaking, leaving a gulp in my throat every time. For me, the beauty of the desert includes the people. Their stories, their seemingly self-confidence to be themselves and find a home and life where others only see sand.\n\nThe hikers were found dead. A murder/suicide. An emotional ride for me as I got to know the father of the male hiker and the group of people who showed up every week to help him find his son. We now share a bond, brought together by tragedy.\n\nTragedy with a backdrop of truly amazing beauty, so heavenly, something more than who we are. My eyes have been open all along the way, but I only began to see the true beauty of the desert in the summer of 2017.\n\nKaren Devine is an award-winning television journalist and investigative reporter for KESQ News Channel 3, the ABC affiliate and Fox in the Coachella Valley.

I would spin the globe as fast as I could and stop it with my finger. Wherever my finger would land, I declared that I would travel there one day. My little game was the precursor to the bucket list concept. Since my finger mostly stopped in the middle of an ocean, I had to spin and spin until I hit some land. One time, I spun the globe so hard that it orbited out of its contraption onto the floor. I retrieved the globe like a basketball player readying to take a foul shot — one hand on the North Pole and the other on Antarctica. Antarctica subsequently went onto my bucket list.\n\nAfter becoming an adult, I no longer left my travel inspirations to chance. I informed myself the old-school way — by reading. I read adventure stories and pondered over travel magazines and maps.\n\nIn 1966, Francine, my best friend and I, were standing in front of Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood. Two guys drove up in a convertible. One of the guys asked if we wanted to go to Palm Springs for the weekend. I eagerly responded with a yes! There were no mothers around to tell us otherwise. I had never heard of Palm Springs, but I did wonder if it was some place magical since these guys were leaving the excitement of Hollywood even if just for a weekend. I presumed that this Palm Springs must be the place to be. Well, Francine put a damper on this notion. “We-are-not-going-anywhere-with-these-guys,” she said in a motherly tone. I recovered after a fleeting moment of disappointment when I soon realized that I could just add Palm Springs to my travel list.\n\nI finally made it to Palm Springs — the first time in 1974 just to see if it was really real, and the second time in 1992 when I came to stay. I have made a continent-full of scratch offs on my travel list. The desert surroundings mirror and even surpass some of the exotic destinations that I have traveled. If I want a little bit of the outback, I take to the Lykken Trail. If I want the Aegean Sea, I go to — you guessed it — the Salton Sea.\n\nThe desert provides a dramatic backdrop for which artists practicing all art forms can create and curate their craft.

Strong enough to hold my weight and the weight of another, their grayish-white trunks and branches lay barren of leaves all winter. Despite the harsh desert climate, they seem to still grow with little water.\n\nIt was last summer that it started. Laying in my hammock, I would feel water drop from the clear blue sky onto my warm skin.\n\nTiny droplets sprinkled my face and arms.\n\n“Do you feel it raining?” I’d ask a reclining hammock friend.\n\n“No. There are no clouds in the sky,” they’d reply.\n\nEvery time I felt a water droplet on my skin, I would rush to find it.\n\nBut it would cease to be there.\n\nAs the mysterious disappearing act continued in this way, I started to feel I was going mad.\n\nWeeks into spring this year, I went out to revisit the trees to discover they were bare. Despite having one of the wettest winters the desert has had in decades, the trees were not part of the super bloom. I hurried to water them immediately. Two days later, they sprouted their first leaves. Ecstatic, I lay in my hammock for the first time in a while.\n\nSoon, I felt a drop of water on my skin again. I gazed up at the sky, embraced by its radiating sunshine. Then, turning to look down at my arm, I saw it – a clear, tiny water droplet!\n\nI digested for just a moment that I had seen it with my own eyes. Admiring these two trees in wonderment, I asked myself how many lives have they lived before?\n\nThese magical raining trees – are they crying? If they are crying … is it from joy or sadness?\n\n“Which is it, oh magical trees?” I asked aloud.\n\n“What has happened to your spirits that have resulted you to communicate this way? As the wind rustles your branches and you sprout new leaves, is it growing pains? Is it the happiness of being alive?”\n\n“Will you tell me if I listen?”\n\nIn my blue striped hammock, I pray.\n\n“I will listen intently, and watch for your tears,\n\nFor you both have been my confidantes these past few years,\n\nYou saw me weep as well,\n\nBared witness to my struggle on a fateful day,\n\nThat it takes to heal and grow in the desert.\n\nYou saw me laugh ’til I couldn’t anymore,\n\nWhisked away as I read adventures through your branches.\n\nI will hear your story, just as I have told you mine.\n\nI will live inspired by your strength,\n\nLean into your supportive trunks,\n\nCherish it,\n\nFor there are so many stories your branches have to tell,\n\nAs they twist and turn throughout your life.\n\nAs you continue to thrive in the harshest of deserts.”\n\nLauren Bright resides in Morongo Valley. She considers her loves to be writing, dancing and painting. Also, she has a cat named Cat.\n\n“Desert time” was a concept I heard often before finally moving to the desert. I understand that it means things just take longer here. The plants and trees grow slower. People’s lives move slower. I heard it is hard to get things happening because, well, “desert time.” I thought, “I have been living in cities and working in fast-paced industries for 15 years. I am going to keep my usual pace.”\n\nLiving in the high desert for over one year now, I have lived through all the weather changes, the wildlife cycles. I have observed the subtleties of each season. I have experienced how the light changes throughout the year. I have been shocked at how the position of the sun varies so much from winter versus summer. In the winter, the light shines well into my living room on the south side of the house. In summer, the sun is so far north that it is on the other side of the house and doesn’t even shine into the living room at all.\n\nTime is funny here.\n\nIn the summer, it is easy to naturally wake up at or before sunrise. Get up and try to cram in as much as you can before the midday sun forces you indoors to a slow halt. The animals are out as well, to make the most of the morning. The roadrunners and gamble quails scurry around for snacks. Ground squirrels scramble from bush to bush to avoid becoming one. A nap in an air-conditioned space is the best way to avoid the afternoon heat. The hours from 1 to 6 p.m. are slow. Sluggish. The sun is relentless and I am convinced it will never drop below the mountains to the west. Five hours that last seemingly forever. As the sun is about to dip, but there is still light in the sky, turning on the stove or grill to cook dinner doesn’t seem so insane anymore. While cooking dinner, get some chores done before daylight is totally gone. Eat dinner al fresco. Take a walk around the neighborhood. The light on the plants then is magical. Saturated colors make everything look so rich. The bunnies come out to hop around and eat.\n\nIn the winter, days look beautiful from inside the house. The sun is shining, but finally not oppressive. Skies are clear and blue. But, go outside and the winds are maddening. They can last days, weeks. Everything around your house blows away unless it is heavy or bolted down. Our old aluminum windows rattle and shake all night. Will the Joshua tree finally uproot and fall over? Am I safe sleeping under a giant window of glass? Will the windows break and blow in? We pick up roof shingles around the yard after the big winds. Nature is slowly taking our house apart. The view is beautiful, but there are small opportunities of good working time. Then you race against daylight, because once the sun sets, it is pretty much time to be inside. Eat dinner and head to bed. Desert midnight is around 8 to 9 p.m.\n\nWe all know the desert is a place of extremes. Hot and cold. Dry weather and flash floods. Time is also an extreme here. There are days that fly by, when the sun time is short and you can never get enough done. Then there are those summer months that it seems will never end. You have cabin fever and wonder why the hell you moved to such an unsustainable environment.\n\nMy favorite days are the ones where I need to get to the studio to work, but I am so in awe of the beautiful landscape that I procrastinate by wandering around the land, checking on new blooms and plants. I know that I need to hurry up and get to work, but for some reason my instinct is to slow down and enjoy the scenery because, well, desert time.\n\nJanelle Pietrzak is a full-time weaver. After a lifetime of moving all around the country, she has settled in the high desert town of Yucca Valley where she owns a textile design studio and tiny shop called All Roads.\n\nAfter a long week of work, the last thing I wanted to do was get up from my couch. As I watched my Miami Dolphins squeeze out a last-second win, I could see the sun starting to cast a faint pink glow on the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and the weight of regret tugged at me.\n\nI’d told myself I would find a way to get outdoors that weekend, but with a bum ankle, a party Saturday night and the remnants of a hangover still lingering, I figured it might have to wait. The mountains and their hiking trails would still be there next Saturday.\n\nThen my gaze caught my Canon DSLR, almost forgotten in the corner of the room. It brought me back to the afternoon I first drove up the 10 freeway, and saw Mt. San Jacinto and its snow-covered tip two Februarys ago. My bookshelf, my TV, my kitchenware, my closet of clothes – once removed from a moving truck and carried into a room that felt so foreign then – now set the stage for a place that felt a little too much like a home I took for granted.\n\nI’d always promised my mom, who screeches for joy whenever she walks out of my apartment to see the mountains in the morning while visiting, that I’d never stop appreciating this indescribable place where I lucked into a job. So instead, I got up, quickly grabbed jeans and a long-sleeve shirt from my bedroom floor, snatched my Canon and my car keys, and hopped in my Ford Fusion to try and beat the sunset.\n\nDespite my heavy foot on the gas – screaming up Highway 62 as fast as other cars and traffic lights would allow – when the young woman at the gate to Joshua Tree National Park said, “Have a great day,” I worried I would leave disappointed.\n\nStill, I wove back and forth through the park and finally reached Keys View, taking the last parking spot as droves of people with their tripods had beaten me. Rather than try to shuffle between them, though, I struggled to find the unmarked rocky path up to Inspiration Point, nearly breaking into a dead sprint in my boots to cover the half-mile as quickly as my legs would move.\n\nAt the top, though the wind whipped and the couple sitting next to me snickered in between kisses and puffs of their blunt, it was the deepest quiet my ears had sensed in quite some time. As the big ball of light began to inch its way behind the towering mountains that create Palm Springs’ border, the click of my shutter broke the silence in the most pleasing way.\n\nTime was only defined by the dipping of the sun, the settling of the clouds, the ebbing and flowing of the reds, oranges and pinks of the sky, and the adjusting of the exposure on my camera. No Facebook notifications. No football scores. Just an unparalleled front seat to the greatest light show in Southern California.\n\nI was right. That trail, those mountains, the majestic sunset will be there tomorrow, next weekend, even next year, but I may not. And when I wake up in an urban high-rise apartment with towers of brick, metal and glass obstructing my view, I’ll regret those days and nights I put off adventure and beauty for another day.\n\nNathan Brown grew up in the freezing winters and humid summers of the Midwest, just north of Indianapolis in Indiana.

The invitation appeared the way all things do in the desert, by secret prayer, answered. The house was small: one room with sand-plastered walls painted magnolia, one wooden bed, one cane-backed plantation chair, and a large arched window.\n\nI accepted the invitation and spent afternoons curled on soft cotton, piled high, white with warmed patina. Protected by the sacred fronds, I’d drift in and out of daydreams and look out onto the desert.\n\nAt the end of the rows of date palms and ranches was a sea, neglected and forgotten, with waters of murky lavender that lapped onto powdered fish bones. Spellbound, after sleep, I would visit and stand on the sacred bones as the spun gold of the heavens faded.\n\nOne duskfall, I noticed across the sea on another shore, inklings of splendor and echoed lullabies. I wanted to be nearer, so I pushed a paint-chipped boat into the water, climbed in and without oars, trusted the sea’s current.\n\nI drifted across the wakes until I arrived at a row of quiet dwellings. Upon stepping out of my boat, I noticed a girl sound asleep. Hovering above her bed, her black hair fell like a waterfall. She slept in the looming twilight as the ruffled gauze of her faded apricot gown whisked the air.\n\nShe had been there all along on the opposite shore and had slept all winter. I kept my distance so as not to wake her. I wondered who loved her. And couldn’t help but imagine love must have sent her into such a peaceful sleep that she floated above her own piled cotton. She glowed in the sea’s reflection of the arriving moon.\n\nI left her sleeping and continued on. The ghostly sands blew onto the streets past the lonesome shacks.\n\nI heard a melody in the distance. A chanteuse sang through an open window. Her porcelain fingers plucked notes from the strings of a well-traveled guitar. She sang of her heartbeat just as I could feel mine. Strangers gathered around to listen to her words of sweet loss and heard her long after the singing. I fell asleep under a grand tamarisk tree in her yard and in the morning as I opened my eyes, its branches swam in the air, still lullabied.\n\nI walked to the sand to find my boat. The sea was now a shade of mint tsavorite. A poem set softly alight by the sun read: “I still love you.”\n\nMercè Clay wrote this in homage to the Bombay Beach Biennale 2019, and was especially inspired by installations “Loving, Loving” by Vera Sola, “Levitation” by Josèphine Wister Faure featuring gown by Heidi Merrick and “I Still Love You” by Olivia Steel.

So many people talking at me, the sound of dishes clanking and froth wands whistling at my regular coffee shop. Music playing at work. Class lectures. The sound of the dishwasher running. Somehow, even at the end of the day, when the lights are turned off and my phone’s across the room, I can still hear the electricity of the city humming through my walls and my pillow.\n\nAnd then it starts all over again.\n\nAlarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming. Alarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming.\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd I hold my breath, cause surely this is a dream.\n\nIt’s still...silent.\n\nAm I dreaming? I guess it’s not technically silent. But there’s no noise.\n\nI hear the wind whispering and the sand grinding beneath my feet. As if I were pinching salt between my fingers.\n\nI’m back to the infinite golden hills at sunset. No man or skyscraper in sight.

That kind of intentionality in art puts my soul at ease and my mind to sleep.\n\nI don’t live in the desert anymore.\n\nI live in a busy city, within a busy life with a lot of noise.

This woman meant well, I’m sure, but I didn’t plant the rosebushes.\n\nI did spend many hours in my rocking chair on my front porch, staring across the arroyo into the chaparral covering the neighboring mountain. I breathed in the air scented with pungent white sage, the spicy vanilla of the blooming redshank, and the patchouli-like stink of our tiny native wildflower whose name no one knows. I drew the desert air deep into my lungs and released it as slowly as I could. Seconds of breathing turned into hours which turned into days. Time passes slower in the desert, it seems. Time passes, but grief does not.\n\nEach loss carries its own means of navigation, but no promise that the next one – because one thing life can promise is that there will forever be a next loss until finally, restfully, we reach the ultimate one ourselves – but there is no promise that the next one will hurt any less. With each loss we learn to bear not only this one, but that one. That next one coming.\n\nWhen I was a little girl growing up in the Imperial Valley, 15 miles from the Mexican border, after every earthquake my family would drive into the desert and search for signs of damage. It was never hard to find.\n\nThere were rifts, fissures and ridges. There were fresh new cracks in the rocky sand whose soft edges crumbled into the tiny abyss when we stepped too near. The earth had changed. The face of the map had been re-drawn. One had to learn a new method of navigation, if, say, the road had shifted a few feet away. But the journey wasn’t over. The journey didn’t end because the road did.\n\nMy heart, my life, is a quake-damaged landscape with areas labeled ‘Here there be monsters,’ but I’ve learned not to avoid them. I explore those areas tentatively, offer a gentle stroke of recognition to the monsters I encounter, tell them they are welcomed to take up residence. My monsters are my battle scars, my mythological reminders that I fought and lost but yet live. I welcome them, each one, lovingly, because even the wildest beast may be tamed.\n\nThe desert sky is wide enough that I don’t need to plant a garden to reflect my losses. The dry wind bears it, each scent supports it. Ultimately, the space here may hold multitudes. Grief is a monster that never goes away. We carry him forever; but in time we learn to manage the weight of him. Just carrying him makes us stronger.\n\nSara Marchant received her Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts from the University of California, Riverside/Palm Desert.

I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and tiny tennis shoes. I’m 6 years old and I’m happy.\n\nMy mom, my sister and I drive to the entrance of the Sabas Nieves trail of the El Ávila Mountains in Caracas, Venezuela. I always get lazy at the start, but once we start going up the trail, the trees, the views of downtown Caracas and the promise of my favorite ice cream once we get back down keeps me going.\n\nHiking the Sabas Nieves trail was a weekend tradition back then. Years have passed, our family grew and traditions changed, but the memories of our hikes have always stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nIt’s been almost eight years since I left Venezuela and almost five years since I left my parents’ house in Texas for college. When I accepted an internship at The Desert Sun and relocated to Palm Springs almost two years ago, I knew nothing about the Coachella Valley. I had lived in the U.S. for six years and, having resided in Houston and Baton Rouge, I forgot that living in an area surrounded by mountains was a possibility.\n\nNow, Caracas and the Coachella Valley could not be more different. One’s a city within a valley in a tropical, humid area merely an hour from the Caribbean Sea, and the other is an arid, desert region with cactuses, intense heat in the summer and a whole lot of sand. But the first time I saw the San Jacinto Mountains along the desert cities, I remember feeling like I was back home.\n\nBut being far away from family and old friends, working hard and dealing with life’s ups and downs can be isolating. So, I hold on to old memories and make sure I create new ones by exploring the world I now found myself in.\n\nEvery Friday, I set my alarm for an early morning wake-up call, hit the snooze button about 10 times.

Between admiring the recently revived plants (thank you rainy winter) and each other’s support, we make it to the top.\n\nAs I look at the valley from above, I think about my family and how they’re always with me even when we’re apart. I think about my friends and the many adventures we’ve gone on. I think about how lucky I am to have landed in a place like this and in that moment, even after the worst of weeks, I am happy.\n\nJose Bastidas is the food reporter and producer for The Desert Sun.

He first moved to the Coachella Valley when he accepted an internship at The Desert Sun in 2015.\n\nWhen I travel, I struggle to find time to sit back, enjoy, contemplate and observe my new surroundings sufficiently. Meticulously calibrated schedules sever my connection to my natural senses and leave me stressed out. It is no easier to find time to think and ponder at home.\n\nAs a recent resident of Palm Springs, I still enjoy some anonymity in public spaces where I can meditate uninterrupted (at least until a friend or neighbor greets me). Somehow I get energy from being in the presence of other people, especially those I don’t know. I can gather up their vibes, store them and feel revitalized enough to give them all back to others.\n\nI discovered this power in New York City, where I could walk among thousands of people, collecting energy like a squirrel collects acorns. In Florence, I would sit in the Piazza della Repubblica and absorb the history in every stone, monument and tower. At Leidseplein square in Amsterdam – filled with chairs and tables on a sunny, warm day – I imagined comedy and drama flowing from my fellow diners.\n\nOnce while sitting outside the Starbucks at the corner of Tahquitz and Palm Canyon, I realized I had found a similar space in Palm Springs. My local, public square is bounded by the Starbucks, the Welwood Murray Memorial Library, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and the empty space under construction where I hope the 22-foot-high statue of Marilyn Monroe will return. While the desert modernist grandeur of the library represents the sole architectural focal point, adding Marilyn across from the library could create the perfect architectural counterweight (as it once used to be).\n\nIn my square, like other European plazas, I can sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and a pastry while watching the downtown foot traffic. After finding the optimal seat for viewing, I savor the aroma and flavor of my brew, nosh a bit and enjoy the parade. If I am in a restless mood, my thoughts go to, “Oh, no! What is that he’s wearing?” But more often, I play games like “What country are they from?” or “Are they married or dating?”\n\nIf the passersby don’t grab my attention, there is sometimes a person at a nearby table whose life story I can fabricate. What to others may look like an ordinary tourist in my mind has become an international opera star trying to avoid the paparazzi, while the man behind her tries discreetly to take her photo with his phone. I might even play the role of a secret agent or slumming celebrity.\n\nThese moments alone are rarely guilt-free because there is always some other more productive use of my time. But for the small rental fee embodied in a purchased cup of coffee, a seat at my public square provides a welcome respite from my daily routine.\n\nDavid Kelly is a former banker, executive chef and lawyer who currently enjoys writing and performing his works at CONNECTED, Bohemian Café and The Desert Sun’s Coachella Valley Storytellers Project.

Benitez-Brown) is a Filipino-American artist, who splits his time between Quezon City and LA.\n\nHot weather is a regular part of life in the Coachella Valley.\n\nThis past summer, temperatures soared above 120 degrees; even during fall months, the heat often rises above 100, sometimes late into October. How can anyone live through this – months of triple-digit temperatures – let alone find beauty at this time of year, when, due to the understandable mass exodus of fair weather residents and tourists, it often feels like we’re living in a ghost town?\n\nLike many others, I hide behind dark curtains, holding a seemingly endless vigil of waiting for the sun to go down. When it does finally slide behind Mount San Jacinto and cover the valley with a long curtain of shade that begins in Palm Springs and slides across the desert floor to the Little San Bernardino Mountains, I venture outdoors to mostly empty roads.\n\nEven though temperatures often hover in the 90s or higher at this time of night, I emerge from my South Palm Desert condo to go on my daily walk. I wear my reflective, fluorescent green Nike tank top, the lightest shorts I have and a small backpack that holds my 2-liter CamelBak reservoir filled to the brim with water and a 1-liter water bottle, frozen solid.\n\nDuring my one-hour, 4-mile roundtrip walk, the water bottle will completely melt. As the sky darkens, I walk uphill along Highway 74, passing Silver Spur trailer park and Cahuilla Way. I steadily sip water and hold the frozen bottle alternately to the back of my neck, the front of my chest and under each arm, to help cool myself down.\n\nAs I begin to unwind, my senses tune in to the sound of raucous crickets hiding in the thick desert landscaping in front of Bighorn Golf Club. The rhythm of walking helps to ease the tension in my housebound muscles, and I start to breathe more easily. I get closer to the edge of the wild desert, to the curve in the road where Highway 74 begins to switchback up into the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument, and I look up at the dark sky and am astonished by the beautiful view of warm stars and a toenail of new moon. I feel the sudden rush of a connection to the deep magic of the desert, with its infinite possibilities and ancient history, and I sense the rustling of the palm tree oases I know are tucked into the canyons just beyond where I stand. I imagine a family of thirsty bighorn sheep picking their way down rocky cliffs to drink, and I’m overwhelmed with the understanding that this is a wild desert that few people truly know, evoked only during times of intense weather such as this.\n\nAnd then, I hear the yips of a pack of coyotes cascade down from Cahuilla Hills. When their cries fade into the darkness, I savor the silence, which now feels like a warm balm rather than loneliness.\n\nRuth Nolan is professor of English at College of the Desert.

She spends most of her time taking photographs, writing poetry, or wandering around the desert.\n\nEvery desert trip began with a quick stop off Highway 10 for date shakes and chili at Hadley’s. We’d sit at the counter beneath black and white signed photos of old Hollywood stars I was too young to recognize. Giant tour busses parked alongside the green and yellow building while tourists took a bathroom break or browsed the aisles of mixed nuts and novelties. This was our desert ritual that meant we were almost there…\n\nTurquoise waters sparkled against the stucco and concrete of a generic condominium complex pool, which overlooked a brilliant green golf course in Palm Springs. This is where my dad taught me how to swim.\n\nOverwatered lawns and manicured sidewalks encircled a royal blue manmade lake in La Quinta, where in the mud between the grass and concrete path, my cousins and I played with army green toy soldiers and mini plastic farm animals while my grandparents made sandwiches or went out for a round of tennis.\n\nA few years later my sister and I took the 10 on our own, to dance across the emerald green polo fields of Indio. We moved to the sounds of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV On The Radio in little jean cut offs and big sunglasses under a cloudless sky.\n\nThe desert I seek now is not painted in such vivid greens and blues, after all my parents are divorced, my grandparents are long gone, and Coachella now costs half my paycheck to listen to bands I no longer know. So those desert memories are magic to me, as they capture the time when my family came together and actually shared meals. When adults and children spent just as much time playing as the other. The desert was our haven, where life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nToday I know how water is such a precious resource, how 330 acres of manicured lawns is unnatural, almost criminal, and how life’s worries will follow you wherever you go. But I still long for the desert, seeking the magic it carried for me before I knew magic was something to be sought after. I continue to come back here, not just to relive those memories that undoubtedly shaped who I am today, but to chase the desert’s brilliant sunsets, expansive horizons and magnificent super blooms. To look up at the sky and see stars I forgot were always there. To watch the sunrise because I want to – not because I have to on my way to an early work shift. To look out at a sea of dirt, dust and Joshua trees. To marvel at the blanket of yellow gold wildflowers across the desert floor. To sit in quiet, far from any reception or media, so that my mind can finally think for itself. To sip on a date shake while I recall the time I first learned to swim, or when I danced the night away beneath the desert sky, or when life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nNina Harada is a writer, actor and artist.

Nearly a year together means that we both know this. There is a certain irony then to the sun beating down on our exposed arms as we stand in a group of 20 or so listening to a woman as old as my grandmother explain the difference between alligator and Utah juniper. The average age of our cohort is not far off the age of our guide, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that this two-hour “nature hike” isn’t going to be leaving the parking lot. My Earth Day date idea, so good in theory, is rapidly seeming more like the opposite with each passing minute.\n\n“Want to go find a trail?” I ask under my breath so as not to offend our volunteer naturalist.\n\n“Yes please,” E. replies.\n\nJavelina Trail guides us deep into Red Rock State Park, following the path of an irrigation canal dug by the original homesteaders of this land.

Wolfberry. Desert marigold.\n\nThe plants of a childhood spread out across the high deserts of Arizona and California, always present by never quite appreciated. Now I cling to their names like a free climber to a ledge, determined not to take for granted the landscape that dominates my life, waking and sleeping.\n\nI will admit I have an ulterior motive. Our early dates revolved around taking advantage of the natural beauty of Arizona. Somehow, despite living in a place renowned for its expansive landscape and access to nature, we seem to have lost the magic of those first explorations together. Our Sedona trip for me represents a lifeline back to that place where everything is new and each discovery together is a forking in the trail with no clear end in sight.\n\nWe pause at a rock wall on top of a ridge to take advantage of the shade provided by a ponderosa pine. It’s our first opportunity for conversation that doesn’t involve one of us having to stare at the back of the other. Our conversation, observed by the red and umber striped peaks of nearby Cathedral Rock, meanders in a way that is both pleasant and familiar. We talk about erosion and the nature of colors. We discuss how we would foster a sense of curiosity in our theoretical children by encouraging them to explore the natural world. We make plans for more hikes, more time away from our community, more intention in how we spend our time together.\n\nOn that lookout in the land of tourists and overpriced crystal shops, it becomes clear that this day was not a bad idea; it was exactly what we needed.\n\nA guitar plays.\n\nThe sound bounces off art-laden walls, filling the concert space.\n\nI sing an Indian folk song which wildly enters the sonic forest.\n\nOutside, the desert is quiet.\n\nJoshua Tree takes me as I am this cold night. Barren land makes space for me to croon in the language of my grandparents, “Kesariya Balam, padharo mhare des!” Oh my Beloved, come to my land!\n\nI drove into the desert in May of 2015, freshly divorced and hoping for the kind of redemption that breathing new air always seems to offer. As I passed a familiar, color-changing mountain, the cacophony of heartbreak rang in my ears, and I almost missed its message. The mountain’s message, that is. It came to me as two clear, sequential instructions:\n\n1. Write a poem, and\n\n2. Have courage\n\nI thought exactly what anyone would think: That’s a dumb, bossy mountain that clearly has no real-life experience. It’s never gone through a complex problem requiring a robust solution.\n\nI unloaded my car of the clothes and books I’d brought from Texas, and rested my head in my mother’s lap before doing the inevitable – Googling “local poetry reading.”\n\nThe next morning, I formulated a poem in my head while driving to an open mic. I ordered an organic brew and dribbled the words of the poem onto the back of the receipt.\n\nComing down from the creative high, I could smell the words. They reeked of having loved too much. They smacked of the sort of pining that remains popular in Bollywood films but is too buttery thick for my American sensibilities. Adding to its deficiencies, the poem had too many driving metaphors. I decided it couldn’t be released into the Universe, so I placed the whimpering piece in my back pocket. Without skipping a beat, the saucy mountain let out an “ahem!” for ignoring instruction No. 2.\n\nA couple of cloistered months later, I went to another open mic and did what I swore I wouldn’t do – I became that kind of poet and apotheosized both my lost relationship and my slowly fading identity. My ex-husband and I got the two-become-one-thing right, but in all the wrong ways. As he disappeared from my life, “I” disappeared from my life. Standing before several desert poets, I festered in the fury of all the avoidable mistakes we had made. They clapped for me. Smiled at me. Deflected from the smell of pity in the air by telling me they liked “this image” and “that simile.” They forgave me.\n\nThe barren desert wasn’t barren after all.\n\nMore than two years later, I’m under the balcony seats of a secluded concert venue, not far from the Joshua Forest.

A car was already marooned in the current, with its driver standing on the other side, waiting for some help.\n\nIf not for the harrowing possibility of being washed away, the day was as picturesque as they come. Migrating birds with white feathers and long legs wading through shimmering water, set against the backdrop of snow-topped mountains and a cobalt sky.\n\nI heard the water rushing over the hidden asphalt. The current carried rocks and vegetation, making a roar and muting the otherwise audible noise from people and engines. I was astounded by the force and speed of this impromptu river, crashing into civilization as residents were on their way to Target or the Post Office.\n\nI hear stories from people who were raised here, about a time when the whole valley would shut down while the wash crisscrossed every major artery of Palm Springs and the surrounding towns. I am learning the power of the Whitewater River and its distributaries, as well as its primary source, Mount San Gorgonio. Also known as Old Grayback, and part of the Transverse Ranges, its snowmelt feeds the river and its frenzied washes.\n\nIt’s not hard to be in awe of the dramatic changes we experience in the Coachella Valley. We live in this desert of opposites. Nature and technology. Cactus and rain cloud. Our senses are surrounded by beauty so raw, we are drawn to touch it. Engage with it. Immerse ourselves utterly and escape the digital rhythms of our lives. The harsh summers provide us with a Mother Nature so unforgiving, we are reminded of our tenuous hold on this planet. We witness the cycle of birth and death annually, as the rain and river give life, and the arid heat takes it away.\n\nI returned to the same spot today on Cathedral Canyon, hoping to see those white birds. The yellow grasses told me what I already suspected. Other than a rill no wider than three feet, the landscape was transformed back into a field.\n\nThat day by the wash will remain with me forever. Life was reinvigorated for a momentary season of excess and plenitude. Down here in the valley, the lizards, the saltbush and we humans are but passing through. Our inventions of conditioned air and roaming vehicles help us to survive, but I will always have respect for the power of wind, water and temperature.\n\nThey come for the winter, visitors from northern climes, and indeed it is sight to behold the nature that flourishes here. The mountain draws our eye to the sky. A netherworld of snow and cloud peers down on us as if from another time zone. Ancient and silent, the mountain’s silhouette is an elder. San Jacinto speaks to us in a language of memory, and we may listen freely, if we choose.\n\n“Remember this cycle of abundance and growth, of lack and conservation. Imprint it in your DNA.

I stood there numb to everything.\n\nNow, what? What about that loft we were going to get? Or the two children we imagined running in our backyard?\n\nSnapping out of my daze, I heard his voice shouting from downstairs, “Grab my bike off the mantle, will you?” The studio now looked like it did the day we arrived. Empty. Sunlight hit the wooden floors, and I closed the door before slipping the keys under. The smell of the panadería across the street whiffed into my nose as I took one more glance at the old man who waited to die on our street every day, smoking his last cigarette while notes of jazz filled the city. All of this ultimately became a part of me.\n\nBut this isn’t our story; it’s mine, and you’re just a part of it.\n\nI hauled everything I owned into my car, with my ex-lover’s bicycle attached to the roof. The fog eventually disappeared, the roads shifted from pavement to gravel and the heat seeped into my skin. Mountains on every corner replaced buildings, and we were back on 1-10 headed for the desert. The only noise you could hear was the clamoring of the wine glasses we bought together, the rattling of his bike and a loud, vast, open sound only the desert landscape can produce. Two summers ago, after a stint of city living and what seemed to be an enormous amount of young love, I found myself back at my childhood address. Seeing the windmills silhouetted against the mountainside, the comfort of home rushed into my body. The desert held a familiar scent – my grandmother’s Filipino cooking, soy sauce mixed in with vinegar, ginger and garlic simmering ever so slowly in a huge metal pot, along with the subtle smell of coconut bundled in banana leaves – and the feeling that everything was going to be alright. Or at least that was the sensation I craved.\n\nThere I was, unpacking everything in my parents’ garage. I’d left behind one of the best teaching jobs in Oakland and a life I thought I knew. On the evening of my return to the desert, the gradient of colors from the sunset melded into a fiery warmth that embraced my existence. Within that moment, I realized I needed to let all of it happen.\n\nExhausted from the drive, I went to the backyard and dug my feet into the earth. The damp grass felt good against my hot skin, and I wasn’t sure how to move forward or if I even could. As I looked up at the summer moon, my body knew this was the end of a relationship but the beginning of something new. Sometimes people, places and things happen because they help you arrive at your next destination. I never planned to move back here, but the desert chose me.\n\nMichelle Castillo is a writer, educator, community arts organizer and social activist based out of Palm Springs.

While the car is on. It’s 4:30 a.m. and I’m wondering if the McDonald’s in Baker is open 24 hours. I’m wondering if I’m up for whoever would be at a McDonald’s in Baker in 5 a.m. I’m gauging the drive to Tecopa and imagining, over and over, sinking into the hot mud of the spring. I lift my head into the cold air, hands still rubbing each other in the exhaust, and see the first light hit the white cross and then bleed out on the pink rocks. Mojave Desert Preserve, January.\n\nMy 9-year-old daughter scratches the ice on the inside of the SUV window, thrusting her hand out of the mass of her sleeping bag wrestled into a sitting position. Heart, she scratches. Smiley face. And then the dog’s name. We’re up.\n\nIn the next hour, she’ll watch the local college field trip cool older kids at White Cross Campground get up from their dozen tents and start packing for their day’s trek. She’ll get growled at by the dude in the remote back of the dispersed camping area who wants us to stay further than 200 yards from his motorhome. She’ll scramble through scree to find petroglyphs peeking through chia flowers. Until we are parked and drinking hot tea made on a burner in the back of the truck while the trains rush by, the conductor blasting the horn at her, at us, the only humans standing within a few miles, waving back at him, as he shoots past and sinks back into the desert.\n\nLater, after the dog barks at being left standing on the lava rocks as we crawl into a cave, after we carry the dog down the ladder into the lava tubes, stand in the cave a bit, and carry the fool dog back up, a guy says to her, watching the entire circus enterprise, “You should know, you have a really cool mom.” But I want to tell him, oh tell her anything at this age, she also thinks I’m a good singer and God knows that’s not true. But she also knows I just tossed her a cup in the back of the car and said pee here then. She knows there comes a moment in every night in every tent where I say enough, please stop talking. She is just now getting old enough to know all moms are not like me. If I get the balance just right, somewhere between tough love and gentle listener, that may in the end be said to be to my credit.\n\nIn the meantime, January in the cold desert still sounds good to her, so I haven’t broken her yet.\n\nLiving in the far southeastern end of the Coachella Valley was not always something I appreciated. Definitely not when I was a younger person. Growing up on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Reservation in Thermal, the desolateness seemed to stunt my ability to dream. The vast open desert, agricultural fields and treacherous-looking mountains represented infinite emptiness at the time. I remember feeling so far away from anywhere, and believing that everything was happening someplace else.\n\nIn high school, my parents facilitated an interdistrict transfer for me to Palm Desert High. They believed I would receive a better education there. It was a different world from the community of Torres Martinez. Some of my fellow students had cars at ages 16 and 17 that were more fancy and expensive than those of our teachers. Life seemed privileged for a lot of my peers. But not for me and not for the young people I knew growing up. Our reservation and the surrounding rural community was, as it still remains, a place where many who live there work the hardest and also earn the least.\n\nExperiencing this proximity of poverty to extreme wealth in the desert was suffocating to me. Thus, as a teen, I could not wait to leave. Fortunately, my university education led me to schools in South Dakota, Humboldt County in Northern California and the Bay Area. All places of tremendous beauty. America’s vast great plains. The regal redwood forest. The state’s largest estuary. These journeys had the same origin and led me back to the same place, Torres Martinez. Each voyage away from home strengthened my appreciation for the reservation landscape. The distance from the rushing nature of city life now fosters my ability to think clearly.\n\nPeople often come to our area and see nothing but poverty and potential for expansion. But the reality is that Desert Cahuilla history, lifeways and culture have been there far longer than anything else. Those of us who were taught to can see the places relevant to our creation all around us. Everything, down to the natural colors of the earth, has meaning to us.\n\nIt’s clear that not everyone sees it this way. To some, our home area is a place where they can leave things they don’t want near them. Unwanted human waste, polluted water, old furniture and useless appliances are dumped in our homelands. Developers don’t see the wide open space as a sanctuary for free desert animals and plants to live, like my family does. Though the tribe has authority on what happens within our boundaries, there’s no regulating everything.

The official is pleading with Russian President Vladimir Putin to reopen the channels, and the EU is proposing ways to ease the blockade of produce exports like corn, wheat and barley out of Ukraine. The EU's top diplomat announced today that the bloc will provide $521 million in military support to Ukraine. Meanwhile, a sustained Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region was hampered after at least two bridges vital to continuing the Ukrainian advance were blown up. However, Ukrainian forces are reportedly pressing on in the area\n\n2.Baby formula\n\nParents are looking for answers and alternatives as the baby formula shortage continues to worsen in the US . A recall and plant shutdown from Abbott Nutrition in February snowballed into larger supply chain issues, resulting in extremely high out-of-stock rates for baby formula -- 43% for the week ending May 8. Manufacturers say they are producing at full capacity , and Abbott says its plant could be open in a matter of weeks, but it's all not enough to keep up with demand. The American baby formula market is relatively shut off from other countries due to regulatory constraints and recent trade agreements, which is helping drive the product shortage.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear what experts are saying as baby formula crisis grows Replay More Videos ...

On the Democratic side, Stacey Abrams is running unopposed , setting up a potential rematch with Kemp following a previous loss to him in 2018. However, since her defeat, Abrams has soared to national prominence and is no longer an underdog with little following outside of Georgia. This comes as early voting has surged to record levels in the Georgia primary, with more than 800,000 ballots cast ahead of today's contests.\n\n2.

These highly choreographed hearings will be the panel's first opportunity to show the public what it's learned from more than 1,000 witness interviews and 135,000 documents during its 10-month investigation.

It marked a rare moment for Congress to hear testimony from someone as young as Cerrillo on a subject as sensitive and disturbing as gun violence. Family members of shooting victims also made passionate pleas for gun legislation. The hearing, however, clearly displayed the partisan divide in the debate on guns as Democrats urged stronger gun control, while Republicans pushed back on restrictions.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'She had blood everywhere': Uvalde pediatrician describes treating young girl Replay More Videos ...

Notably, however, the leaders of several countries that are crucial to addressing the influx of migrants at the border -- including Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- are boycotting the summit, dealing an embarrassing blow to the White House at a time when it is scrambling to handle the issue. At the US southern border, US Customs and Border Protection stopped more than 310,000 migrants from the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador from October through April, according to the latest agency data.\n\nJUST WATCHED Blinken: Immigration challenges beyond anything that anyone has seen before Replay More Videos ...

Tapping the stockpile of 600 million barrels of crude oil, which are stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas, probably won't have a huge effect on gas prices because of limits on how much oil can be released at a time. But it's a political sign from Biden that he is trying to address the problem. The US price of a gallon of regular gasoline spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine, hitting a record high of $4.33 earlier this month.

Nonetheless, the Biden administration has kept the measure in place. About 1.7 million migrants have been sent back to Mexico or their country of origin since March 2020, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.

It's the biggest increase in 28 years and will affect millions of American businesses and households by pushing up the cost of borrowing for homes, cars and other loans. Many consumers who are already concerned about the soaring cost of living will now face higher mortgage rates that will make it harder to afford homes. However, that weaker demand could cool off prices in the future. The goal of the Fed's interest rate hikes is to get inflation under control while keeping the job market recovery intact, but experts say the war in Ukraine, supply chain issues, and Covid-19 could impact that progress.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nCovid-19 vaccines could be available for children as young as 6 months as early as next week, according to the White House. FDA vaccine advisers voted unanimously on Wednesday to authorize the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines for emergency use in the youngest children. The FDA, which typically follows the committee's decisions, is expected to vote on the authorization this weekend. Children younger than five are the only age group not currently eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19. About 17 million kids will become eligible for vaccines once they're authorized for this age group. Separately, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, has tested positive for Covid-19 and is receiving treatment.\n\n3.

The hearing, aides said, will also reveal new materials about then-Vice President Mike Pence's movements on January 6, including his whereabouts and what he was doing when rioters breached the Capitol.

During a search of the gunman's home, federal authorities found a laptop with a document containing a detailed plan of the attack he had allegedly been planning for years, according to a criminal complaint.

Ukraine\n\nRussia said today some of its troops would return to base after completing recent drills , but stressed that other major military exercises would continue. For weeks, Moscow has steadily built up its forces around Ukraine, with everything from submarines and ships in the Black Sea, to ballistic missiles and tanks near the border -- raising fears that an invasion is imminent. Videos of these movements, mostly from satellite imagery and social media , are putting global stock markets on edge . While there were some signs of a possible last-minute openness to a diplomatic de-escalation by the Kremlin yesterday, officials are worried by Russian President Vladimir Putin's erratic moves as more than 130,000 troops remain near Ukraine's border. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the US for sending his country $1 billion financial aid amid the ongoing crisis. He also thanked Canada for sending half a billion dollars in financial aid.\n\n2. Pandemic protests\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time to address the impact of continued protests across Canada over Covid-19 mitigation measures. The Emergencies Act can provide the use of the military, but may not necessarily lead to that. It can also temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly. The Canadian government is going after those who financially support the groups by freezing personal and corporate accounts believed to be funding the protests. This comes after the Ambassador Bridge -- North America's busiest land border crossing -- reopened after a blockade was cleared and Ontario, Canada's most populous province, announced plans to loosen pandemic restrictions.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trudeau invokes rare emergencies act to stop protests Replay More Videos ...

The measure seeks to overhaul the Postal Service's finances to help allow it to modernize its service.

Voting rights\n\nVoting rights are the focus on Capitol Hill this week as Senate Democrats seek to advance legislation that would impact voting procedures nationwide ahead of the midterm elections. Several Republican-controlled states have enacted new restrictions on such things as mail-in voting and early voting in the name of election security -- measures Democrats fear may affect turnout, especially in battleground states. In response, Democrats are considering measures to counter such restrictions, including making Election Day a federal holiday and setting minimum national standards for voting by mail.

It appears to be the first time the select committee has issued a subpoena targeting a member of the Trump family, marking a significant escalation of the investigation into the former president's role in the insurrection. The records obtained by the committee show incoming and outgoing calls, and the calls' date, time and length.

In a court filing yesterday, investigators stated the office \"intends to make a final determination about who is responsible for those misstatements and omissions.\" The Attorney General's office emphasized it is zeroing in on miscategorized assets, misstatements about the processes Trump and his associates used to reach valuations, and even the size of the Trump Tower penthouse.\n\n5. Antitrust Laws\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and US Justice Department announced yesterday they are reviewing guidelines for corporate mergers and will announce updated rules by the end of the year. The move is an effort to combat the concentration in a range of industries that can reduce competition and consumer choice. Decades of less aggressive antitrust enforcement has led to an increase in merger filings, which nearly doubled from 2020 to 2021.

In addition to extending the existing payment pause, borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness. So, what steps do eligible borrowers need to take ?

During the attack, the shooter remained in two adjoined classrooms for more than an hour before officers entered the rooms and killed him, authorities say. The delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that calls for police to immediately stop the threat. State officials identified Arredondo as the on-scene police commander, though he has said he did not consider himself in charge.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Turn in your badge': Child demands Chief Arredondo be fired Replay More Videos ...

Would submarines reach historic depths? Who would lead nations, and which ones would be global superpowers? Would Planet Earth even exist as we knew it?\n\n\"I shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday I am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car,\" mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan wrote in 1968.\n\nSome, like Brennan, were overly optimistic. Others were spot-on. Here's what happened, what didn't and what was just plain crazy.\n\n1. Life expectancy will rise past 100\n\nFuturist Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to \"over one hundred\" by 2019.\n\n\"Computerized health monitors built into watches, jewelry, and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used. In addition to diagnosis, these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions,\" he wrote in \"The Age of Spiritual Machines.\"\n\nNope: While Kurzweil may have accurately predicted health-related gadgets (such as fitness watches, BioScarves and EKG apps for your smartphone), he jumped the gun on life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, the average life expectancy of the global population was 72.6 years, according to the United Nations. That average is slightly higher in the USA, at 78.6 years in 2017, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThough life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up, it has been going in the opposite direction in America. The United Nation predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77.1 years by 2050.\n\nLife expectancy:What countries have the longest?\n\n2. Computers will be invisible\n\nKurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019, including invisible computers.\n\n\"Computers are now largely invisible. They are embedded everywhere – in walls, tables, chairs, desks, clothing jewelry and bodies. People routinely use three-dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses. ... This display technology projects images directly into the human retina.\"\n\nKeyboards and cables would become rare, he said.\n\nIt's true: Computers are embedded everywhere these days. We have smart homes, smart tables, smart chairs, smart desks and more. Though we may not project images directly into our retinas, Google Glass comes pretty close.\n\n(Per Kurzweil's prediction, scientists are developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid that could provide \"real-time, noninvasive medical diagnostics.\" Several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes.)\n\n3. Books will be dead\n\n\"Paper books and documents are rarely used or accessed. Most twentieth-century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network,\" Kurzweil predicted.\n\nWrong: Though the net revenue of the U.S. book publishing industry has decreased since 2014, the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly $26 billion in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers' annual report.\n\n4. Your every move will be tracked\n\nKurzweil predicted that privacy would be a huge political and social issue and that \"each individual’s practically every move (will be) stored in a database somewhere.\"\n\nTrue, most say: Your TV watches you. Your smartphone follows you. Your web browser traces your digital trail. In an era when some populations worldwide live under 24/7 high-tech surveillance, most U.S. adults say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government, according to a survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center.\n\nMore than 80% say the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits.\n\n5. World's population will reach 8 billion\n\nIn 1994, the International Food Policy Research Institute projected the world population would increase by 2.5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the continent of Africa would add 1.5 billion people, the institute predicted.\n\nClose, but no cigar: The world's population is 7.7 billion, according to a report in June from the United Nations. The report expects the population to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years. Around 2027, India is projected to overtake China as the world’s most populous country, the report says.\n\n6. China will be the world's largest economy\n\nSpeaking of China... in a 1997 article titled \"The Long Boom,\" futurists Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden said China would be on top.\n\n\"By 2020, the Chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world. Though the U.S. economy is more technologically sophisticated, and its population more affluent, China and the United States are basically on a par,\" they said.\n\nClose: In 2019, China still trailed the United States as the world's second-largest economy, by nominal GDP. Recent reports predict that China and India will overtake the United States by 2030.\n\n7. We'll have self-driving cars\n\n\"Self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s, with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty-first century,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nKind of: Dozens of companies – including Tesla, Google spinoff Waymo and ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft – are testing self-driving vehicles in select locations, such as Boston, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWidespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle is not yet here: Experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases.\n\nSelf-driving shuttle:Why a Rhode Island police officer pulled it over\n\nIn April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would have fully self-driving cars ready by the end of the year and a \"robotaxi\" version – one that could ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel – ready for the streets next year. Tesla owners can \"summon\" their cars, which can drive themselves from parking spots to the curb, where the owner is standing.\n\nWhat about flying cars? Porsche and Boeing partnered to create \"premium urban air mobility vehicles,\" and Uber plans to launch a flying taxi service in 2023.\n\n(Planes are landing themselves.)\n\n8. It will be normal to retire at 70\n\nIn his 1994 book \"The World in 2020,\" British commentator and editor Hamish McRae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70.\n\n\"The main motive for this in Europe is cost to the state. Governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised, the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them,\" McRae wrote.\n\nNo: In the USA, the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women, according to the Center for Retirement Research. That number has stayed relatively steady for men over the past few decades but has increased for women. For full Social Security benefits, the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born.\n\nSome European countries set 67 as retirement age, the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions, and several plan to raise the age in the next few years, according to the Finnish Center for Pensions. For many Europeans, the topic is a matter of fierce debate.\n\n9. Americans will vote electronically from home\n\nAs the millennial generation comes of age, they'll be able to vote electronically from home, Schwartz and Leyden predicted – possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008.\n\nNot yet: Amid fears of foreign interference in U.S. elections, lawmakers aren't about to let you vote in next year's presidential election on your iPhone. Proponents of online voting say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations.\n\nStartups are developing solutions for online voting, such as the Voatz mobile voting platform, which has used biometric/facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the USA. Last year, West Virginia began using Voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas. In one Utah county, citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election.\n\n10. China will be on a path to democracy\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that, despite taking \"draconian measures\" to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century, China \"is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics – though not in the image of the West.\"\n\nNot really: China faces scrutiny over human rights abuses against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and against nearly 1 million Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim population, members of which have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in \"reeducation\" camps in China's Xinjiang region.\n\n11. We'll have 'personal companions'\n\nIn his 1999 book, \"Business @ the Speed of Thought,\" Bill Gates predicted personal devices that \"connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data.\"\n\n\"The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up. It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you're doing,\" Gates wrote.\n\nHey, Alexa: Add milk to my shopping list.\n\nThough Alexa isn't sorting through your emails (that we know of) and your smart thermostat isn't tracking your purchases, Gates isn't far off. Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and an array of smart tech in the Internet of Things readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands.\n\n12. Cars will be able to go months without refueling\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that by 2010, \"hydrogen would be processed in refinery-like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles – and many months – before refueling.\"\n\nBy 2020, they said, almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles, mostly using hydrogen power.\n\nWhat's the future of the auto industry? Hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric\n\nNot yet: Toyota and Honda lead the hydrogen-powered car market, but it's an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery-powered electric vehicles. In 2018, 2,300 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were sold in the USA – less than 1% of the number of electric cars sold, according to InsideEVs, which covers electric vehicle news.\n\nIn other green transportation news: Last year, European railway manufacturer Alstom launched the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train, and next year, London is likely to roll out double-decker hydrogen-powered buses.\n\n13. Heart disease, depression will be world's top diseases\n\nIn 1996, the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization predicted that by 2020, the world's top two causes of the global burden of disease – a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost because of sickness, disability or early death – would be ischemic (coronary) heart disease and unipolar major (clinical) depression.\n\nAt the time, the leading causes were lower respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) and diarrheal diseases, the study said.\n\nClose: In 2017, the most recent year that the data set was published, the five leading causes of the global burden of disease were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n14. Global surface temperature will increase\n\n(Climate predictions tend to have a longer range, but here's a snapshot of where 2020 stands.)\n\nA report in 1995 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.\n\nThe report predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year.\n\nOn track: With 80 years to go, both predictions appear possible. The global average temperature has risen a tad more than 1 degree Fahrenheit since the mid-90s, according to NOAA. Since 1992, the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches, according to NOAA.\n\nMore:Were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate? Here's a look\n\n15. Humans will set foot on Mars\n\nA report in 1996 by the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council said NASA would launch \"possible human exploratory missions to the moon and Mars within the next quarter century,\" predicting that humans would land on Mars by 2018.\n\nSchwartz and Leyden envisioned a similar scenario: \"In 2020, humans arrive on Mars. ... The four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment. The expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet, the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal.\"\n\nNot quite: Though we haven't set foot on Mars, we've landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet's surface.\n\n16. Boris Johnson would lead Brexit\n\nIn 1997, British news organization The Independent forecast that in 2020, Boris Johnson would become a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, a decision-making body composed of the prime minister and a team of handpicked members of Parliament.\n\nAt the time, Johnson, 32, was an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office. \"Not shy in clashing with party lines, Boris would 'renegotiate EU membership so Britain stands to Europe as Canada, not Texas, stands to the USA,' \" the journalists wrote.\n\nPretty close: Have you heard of Brexit? Johnson became prime minister in July. He served in the Cabinet, starting in 2016 as foreign secretary under Theresa May. In December, Johnson led his Conservative Party to victory in a national election on the promise to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\n17. Antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare\n\nImagine a world where battles are fought a few feet above the ground, as soldiers hover in midair. In 1968, mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan predicted that antigravity belts would \"revolutionize the tactics of land warfare,\" writing that \"even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion, relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided.\"\n\nHe suspected that by 2018, humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes.\n\nNo: (Unless you're Luke Skywalker or Buzz Lightyear.)\n\n18. Nuclear will replace natural gas\n\nIn 1968, Stanford University professor Charles Scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors would make up the majority of U.S. energy production by 2018 as natural gas faded.\n\n\"Energy from water power, solar radiation, the wind, tides, or earth heat will not figure large in the totals. Power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost,\" Scarlott wrote.\n\nWrong: In 2018, fossil fuels – petroleum, natural gas and coal – accounted for about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About 12% was from renewable energy sources, and about 9% was from nuclear electric power.\n\nFor the electrical power sector, in particular, nuclear creates 19% of energy.\n\n19. Americans will work 26 hours a week\n\nIn 1968, physicist Herman Kahn and futurist Anthony J. Weiner said that by 2020, Americans would work 1,370 hours a year (or 26 hours a week), instead of the 1,940 hours (37 hours a week) that was average at the time.\n\nUnlikely: Though we work less than we did in 1968, the average American worked nearly 1,800 hours in 2018 (35 hours a week), according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\n20. Nationalism will wane\n\nIn 1968, Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted that better communication, easier translation and greater understanding of the nature of human motivations would make it easier for people to connect across ethnic and national lines.\n\n\"By the year 2018 nationalism should be a waning force in the world,\" he wrote.\n\nThe opposite is true: Fueled by backlash against immigration, globalization and the political establishment, populist nationalism was a driving force behind Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the rise of right-wing politicians in France, Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland, among other countries, academics said.\n\n\"Everywhere one looks, in fact, one sees nationalism at work in today’s world,\" Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/10/26/hydrogen-trucks-nikola-gm-toyota-hyundai-zero-emissions/5981340002/", "title": "Nikola, Toyota, Hyundai seek zero-emission hydrogen trucks", "text": "Sick of the road noise and pollution caused by semitrucks barreling down the road near your house?\n\nThey could soon be harder to hear, and healthier for you and for the planet.\n\nThe 3.7 million heavy-duty trucks that ship goods to consumers, haul raw materials across the country and transport components for manufacturers have long been powered by diesel engines that emit pollution and create significant road noise.\n\nBut an ambitious startup and several established automakers are promising to deliver hydrogen-powered semitrucks that would create zero harmful pollutants, emitting only water vapor, and no engine noise but for the whirl of an electric motor.\n\nThe bottom line? Living next to a highway with trucks could eventually become a much more pleasant experience – but only if the promise of hydrogen fuel cells finally pays off after decades of development.\n\n“They’re quiet. The emissions, the environmental impact, the noise – these are really great benefits for just the person that sees it on the road day to day,” said Yuval Steiman, director of corporate planning for Hyundai, which recently projected there will be 12,000 hydrogen trucks on the road in the U.S. by 2030. That would represent less than 1% of heavy-duty trucks on the road.\n\nHow a typical hydrogen vehicle works\n\nHydrogen vehicles run on electricity created through an on-board fuel cell that generates zero emissions.\n\nFor years, the technology made theoretical sense, yet a lack of hydrogen fuel pumps largely limited its reach. But advancements in hydrogen technology and an emphasis on beginning the technological rollout with heavy-duty trucks instead of cars is beginning to make fuel cell vehicles a reality.\n\n“Hydrogen, which never made sense to me as a consumer powertrain, makes complete sense as a heavy-duty commercial powertrain,” said Karl Brauer, an automotive analyst at vehicle-research site iSeeCars.com, referring to a vehicle's engine and other parts that propel it.\n\nThe stakes for the truck manufacturing industry are significant: The sector is projected to have $27.5 billion in 2020 revenue, employ more than 25,000 workers and pay $1.7 billion in wages, according to research firm IBISWorld. A shift in powertrains could require the industry to overhaul how it sources components, hires workers and meets regulatory standards.\n\nSeveral companies are driving the trend, including:\n\nToyota\n\nThe Japanese company is the leading seller of hydrogen cars in the U.S., with the Toyota Mirai midsize sedan starting at around $59,000. It sold more than 1,500 units of the vehicle in 2019, mostly to customers in California who live close enough to hydrogen fueling stations to make it feasible. The 1,500 units sold represent a fraction of a percent of the total vehicles sold in the U.S.\n\nNow, the company is moving into semitrucks. Earlier this month, Toyota announced a deal with truck maker Hino to jointly develop hydrogen fuel cell trucks for the North American market. The trucks will get the Toyota Mirai’s hydrogen fuel cell technology and Hino’s vehicle body, with plans to deliver a “demonstration vehicle” in the first half of 2021. That deal comes after Toyota in 2019 announced a separate collaboration with Kenworth Truck to develop heavy-duty hydrogen trucks for North America.\n\n“We’re at that tipping point,” said Andrew Lund, chief engineer of heavy-duty trucks for Toyota. “The technology has proven to be available.”\n\nHyundai\n\nLike Toyota and Honda, Hyundai has been working on hydrogen fuel cells for years, including recently selling the technology as the Nexo SUV, which starts at about $59,000 and gets 350 miles on a tank of hydrogen.\n\nEarlier this month, the Korean automaker announced it had delivered the first units of its new hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck, the Xcient, to customers in Switzerland. The company expects to ramp up production capacity of 2,000 units per year by 2021 with plans to bring hydrogen trucks to the U.S. through a $1.3 billion investment in hydrogen infrastructure here.\n\nHyundai expects to become “the world’s first company to mass produce heavy-duty fuel cell trucks,” Steiman said. “We have the vision of this hydrogen society and we think this is bigger than cars, this is bigger than trucks. This is really a power source that can have a lot of implications for the future.”\n\nVolvo, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler\n\nThe two automakers in April announced a joint venture to make hydrogen fuel cells for heavy-duty trucks and other purposes.\n\nEarlier this month, Daimler revealed a hydrogen fuel cell concept vehicle called the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck, saying it would be able to travel up to 621 miles on a single tank.\n\nDaimler said it expects to begin customer trials in 2023 and enter production in the “second half of the decade.”\n\nNikola and General Motors\n\nThe upstart, Phoenix-based Nikola made a splash this year by arranging a deal to go public and reaching a tentative manufacturing and technology partnership with GM. The startup has promised to deliver two hydrogen-fueled heavy-duty trucks, the Nikola Two and the Tre, within the next few years. Nikola founder Trevor Milton predicted to USA TODAY in 2017 that diesel trucks would no longer be available for sale within 10 years.\n\nBut the company has faced increasing skepticism in recent months amid questions about the legitimacy of its plans, leading to concerns that it may not finalize its deal with GM, which is up in the air while negotiators rework their deal.\n\nShort-seller Hindenburg Research published a report accusing Milton of orchestrating an “intricate fraud” with the company, saying that many of its claims were exaggerated or purposely misleading.\n\nSoon after the report, Milton, who has denied those accusations, left the company, which is now facing multiple investigations by the federal government, including one by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe next Tesla?\n\nDespite its troubles, Nikola’s emergence has reminded automotive industry observers of how Tesla exploded onto the automotive scene more than a decade ago, promising new electric-vehicle technology and pledging to revolutionize transportation.\n\nSkepticism about Tesla eventually gave way to a recognition that CEO Elon Musk’s penchant for bombastic proclamations on social media did not change the fact that Tesla’s design and engineering prowess was legitimate. Tesla is now the world’s most valuable automaker in terms of total value on the stock market.\n\nBut can Nikola replicate that model for success?\n\nNikola CEO Mark Russell, who has been charged with helping to stabilize the company following Milton’s exit, said Nikola’s model of installing hydrogen pumps for customers, selling them the fuel and leasing them the truck as one complete package will help the company prevail.\n\nHe told USA TODAY that Nikola has “the potential to show the world that hydrogen can be a cost-effective fuel for long-haul trucking” and the company will “prove that in the next several years.”\n\nBut Nikola’s success may be predicated on whether it can seal the deal with GM or find an alternative manufacturing partner.\n\n“We don’t have any ambition of trying to do everything ourselves,” Russell said. “We’re taking the path of partnerships.”\n\nIf Nikola is successful, that could help popularize hydrogen trucks, which would be “good for everyone,” Toyota’s Lund said.\n\nBut “our strategy is different,” Lund said. “They’ve been outspoken about what they’re going to do. Our culture is to explain to you what we’ve done.”\n\nRussell said he’s been studying Toyota’s success for two decades. “Some of the smartest-led organizations in the world are pursuing hydrogen-fueled vehicles,” he said. The fact that “some of them are also working on hydrogen infrastructure is a validation of Nikola's plan.”\n\nWhy now?\n\nFor years, the joke in the automotive industry has been that hydrogen cars are always 10 years out – but a decade passes, and they’re still 10 years out. Put frankly, hydrogen cars simply haven’t yet made a dent.\n\nSo what makes hydrogen so much more promising for trucking than for passenger cars?\n\nQuite simply, it’s fueling infrastructure. Trucking companies and shippers can plot out their fueling plans by installing hydrogen fuel stations along fixed shipping routes, usually locating them at their regular stops or vehicle maintenance areas. That way truckers don’t have to hunt for hydrogen fuel in the wild, which is effectively impossible to find right now except for a cluster in California.\n\n“You know where to put the stations,” Lund said. “We already see the truck routes.”\n\nBut Lund argued that traditional fuel stations that currently sell gasoline and diesel will eventually find it enticing enough to install hydrogen tanks too.\n\n“We already have a fueling infrastructure throughout the world,” he said. “It’s just a matter of changing it out. It all depends on the adoption rate.”\n\nSome remain skeptical, particularly about Nikola.\n\nHydrogen is simply still too expensive for most shippers to justify investing in fuel cell trucks, said Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrial materials and energy at investment researcher Third Bridge.\n\nThe average price of hydrogen for vehicles in California was $16.51 per kilogram, according to a 2019 government report. But the price is dropping quickly – and Nikola’s Russell said the company can deliver hydrogen for $2.50 per kilogram, which he said is about equivalent in energy to a gallon of diesel fuel.\n\nGovernment mandates like California’s recent announcement that it’s banning gas-powered vehicles by 2035 will also help drive the costs lower, Russell said.\n\n“You’ve got jurisdictions all over the world actually – cities, counties, provinces, states, and even nations are putting outright bans on fossil fuels on their books,” he said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/26"}]}

He’s due to land in Bulgaria on Wednesday.\n\nHis aim: to displace Travis Ludlow of Britain, who was 18 when he set the record in 2021.\n\nRutherford is flying a Shark, one of the fastest ultralight aircraft in the world with a cruising speed reaching 186 mph, which has been specially fitted out for the long journey.

We'll make it work.'\"\n\nThey did make it work, because Rutherford is in the midst of her solo flight across the globe, and if she completes it, she will be the youngest woman ever to do so.

The first thing she asked me, she said, 'Is it OK if I break your record?' I was like: 'Absolutely Zara. Records are meant to be broken.'\"\n\nRutherford's route began in her home nation, Belgium. She took off from an airport in Brussels on Aug. 11 and has since made stops in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Greenland and Canada. She is now in New York City, where she has two rest days, and her next stop is North Carolina, where she will visit the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kitty Hawk.\n\nThe teen aviator flies about five hours nearly every day; the longest solo flight she had ever done before her world record attempt was about 4½ hours. Rutherford said she avoids eating or drinking much before she boards her plane so she doesn't need to use the bathroom while she is in the air.\n\n\"I say that, but on my flight from (Goose Bay, Canada) to Montreal, I had to make an emergency stop,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nThe long hours in the plane can get lonely; Rutherford said she mostly listens to podcasts to pass the time. She said her favorite is 20-year-old YouTuber Emma Chamberlain's podcast \"Anything Goes.\"\n\n\"Especially like over Greenland, you lose radio almost immediately, so it's really quiet, she said. \"If you get a podcast that's just one person talking, then it feels like there's someone there with you.\"\n\nRutherford said her favorite stop has been Kulusuk, Greenland, because of the scenic landscape.\n\n\"I saw my very first whale, so that was amazing, and it's such a stunning sight,\" she said. \"You know the wallpapers that come with a computer of like beautiful scenery? If you take your phone out and snap literally any picture, it looks like that.\"\n\nFor Guinness World Records to consider the trip truly \"around the world,\" Rutherford has to cross points on opposite sides of the globe. On her route, those spots are just below the equator in Columbia and just above the equator in Indonesia. She added nearly 5,000 miles to the trip so she would be able to visit more places.\n\nWaiz said that while she did not directly help Rutherford plan her route, she did offer advice about weather and other challenges she might face during the journey.\n\n\"The weather can really turn on you at any time, so you really have to be just aware of what to expect in different parts of the world during the season,\" she said. \"I told her: 'Only you know if you should take off. Try not to let anything pressure you or commitments you've made around the world. People can wait. At the end of the day, it's you in that plane, so do whatever is best for you.'\"\n\nRutherford said her flights have been mostly smooth sailing, but she did have one stressful moment on her flight from Iceland to Greenland. Her plane cannot fly through clouds, and she hit an overcast system where the clouds forced her to drop to 600 feet. She said she considered turning back, but the clouds cleared up and she was able to continue to her next stop.\n\nWaiz believes Rutherford's humility and intelligence give her a good chance to succeed.\n\n\"If you have an ego going into it, it can really hurt you, so I think Zara being very humble is definitely going to help,\" she said. \"You just never know what Mother Nature's going to do. I feel like she's a pretty grounded person, and she has a really great intuition.\"\n\nWaiz is founder and president of a nonprofit called Dreams Soar, which educates girls around the world about aviation. Dreams Soar is one of Rutherford's charity partners on her flight, and the teen will meet up with Waiz and local Women of Aviation chapter on her stop in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nRutherford is projected to complete her trip on Nov. 3, and though she said the three months remaining are daunting, she is taking things one day at a time.\n\n\"It sounds like a lifetime, but actually, I'm really enjoying it.

A special Texas House committee tasked with investigating the shooting determined that the embattled school district police chief failed to act quickly enough to shoot and kill the gunman. The report, released in July, also determined that Arredondo held the role of incident commander at the scene and was responsible for directing law enforcement officers. Parents and community members have been calling for Arredondo to be fired along with the other five district officers who responded to the shooting.\n\nUkraine marks Independence Day, six months after start of war with Russia\n\nResidents of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city, woke up to air raid sirens Wednesday as the nation observed its Independence Day, six months since the start of the Russian invasion that the whole world appears to be losing. Authorities in Kyiv banned large-scale gatherings until Thursday, fearing the national holiday might bring particularly heavy Russian missile attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the public to be vigilant. \"Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility,\" he said in a statement. Wednesday's holiday commemorates Ukraine's 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department issued an alert Tuesday urging Americans to \"depart Ukraine now,\" citing concerns of possible Russian attacks. As Ukraine marks its holiday, the Biden administration is expected on Wednesday to announce an additional roughly $3 billion in aid to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nClosing arguments in Vanessa Bryant civil trial vs. LA County continue\n\nClosing arguments resume Wednesday in the civil trial of Vanessa Bryant, the widow of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, against California's Los Angeles County after learning that deputies and firefighters had shared photos of her husband and 13-year-old daughter Gianna's remains after their death in a helicopter crash. Seven others were killed Jan. 26, 2020, crash. Tuesday marked what would have been Kobe Bryant's 44th birthday and the first time an attorney put a dollar amount on what he wants the jury to award Vanessa Bryant and Chris Chester, her fellow plaintiff: $75 million for past and future distress. The jury will be tasked with making a series of decisions about the case: First, did these county first responders violate Bryant's and Chester's constitutional privacy rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by publicly disseminating crash-scene photos? If so, is the county liable for it as an organization? Also, if that's the case, how much should the jury award them in exchange for their past and future emotional distress?\n\nTeen pilot poised to become youngest person to fly around the world solo\n\nA Belgian-British teen on Wednesday could become the youngest person to fly around the world solo in a small plane. Mack Rutherford, who turned 17 during the journey, touched down Tuesday near the city of Charleroi, Belgium, where he originally learned to fly. He's due to land in Bulgaria on Wednesday. His quest, which began March 23, took him through 52 countries over five continents, crossing the equator twice to conform with Guinness World Records requirements. Rutherford hopes to displace Travis Ludlow of Britain, who was 18 when he set the record in 2021.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/24/six-months-ukraine-student-loan-forgiveness-5-things-podcast/7882932001/", "title": "Six months in Ukraine, student loan forgiveness: 5 Things podcast", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Six months of war in Ukraine\n\nInternational reporter Kim Hjelmgaard reports on investigations into war crimes.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 24th of August, 2022. Today, six months of war in Ukraine, plus student loan debt forgiveness, and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nThe US military said earlier today that it carried out airstrikes in Eastern Syria. They targeted areas used by militias backed by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. No immediate casualty figures were available. An attorney for Vanessa Bryant urged a jury to award $75 million to her and fellow plaintiff, Chris Chester. They're suing Los Angeles County accusing officials of taking pictures of the crash scene where their loved ones, including NBA star, Kobe Bryant, were killed in a helicopter in 2020. And a new survey from the Harris poll found that 84% of parents learned more about their kids' education during the COVID pandemic. You can find the poll's full findings on USATODAY.com.\n\n♦\n\nToday marks six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. And it also happens to be the country's Independence Day. The holiday commemorates Ukraine's 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, though many across the country won't be celebrating much. Authorities in Kyiv have banned large scale gatherings until at least Thursday. There are fears the holiday might bring particularly heavy Russian missile attacks, and tensions are high after a car bomb killed a hard line Russian commentator outside Moscow this past weekend.\n\nGlobally, the US and EU are still throwing support behind Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated the defense alliances, \"support for Ukraine for the long term so that Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation.\" Former US ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, told the AP that Ukrainians remain determined to push back on Russia's advances.\n\nIvo Daalder:\n\nFar from the cakewalk and greeting Russia as liberators that Moscow seemed to think would happen, the Ukrainians offered extraordinary resistance. There is war worry, and war wariness. At the same time, there's also determination. It is very clear that the Ukrainian people and overwhelming majorities are behind their government's determination to not only resist the Russian military advances, but ultimately, to regain full independence of every inch of Ukrainian territory, and are willing to fight to that end.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd in the US, the Biden administration is expected to announce today an additional $3 billion to the country to help train and equip Ukrainian forces. To date, the US has provided more than $10 billion in military aid to the country since the start of the Biden administration.\n\nMeanwhile, we're learning more about suspected war crimes committed during Russia's invasion. And international reporter Kim Hjelmgaard tells producer PJ Elliott that the pursuit of justice in war time is far from clear.\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nKind of six months into this war between Ukraine and Russia, there's almost 30,000, 26, 27,000 war crimes allegations by the Ukrainians against Russians. These include ordinary soldiers, military commanders, also high level officials, propagandists, judges, cabinet ministers, and of course Mr. Putin himself. And Ukrainians launched their investigations pretty much within the first week of this unprovoked invasion by Russia. And there's been a range of claims and allegations related to sexual violence, torture, kidnapping, much of which was conducted in the suburbs in and around Kyiv in March. Since then, in fact, since late February, all of Ukraine has been bombarded with missiles, shells, rockets, pretty much nonstop. And a lot of these munitions are falling into residential neighborhoods. They're hitting schools, they're hitting apartment buildings, they're hitting warehouses, they're hitting all sorts of things, and civilians are dying.\n\nA lot of these deaths don't necessarily all fall under war crimes because in order to meet a war crimes test, there has to be certain things in place. For example, there has to be an intention. The Russians have to have intended to hit say a school. There has to be... Military necessity is a factor, and a couple of other things.\n\nUkrainians want to try or hear the majority of these cases in their own courts, rather than waiting for a case say to kind of wend its way to an international court in the Hague or possibly even years from now connected to the UN or some other kind of venues where they could potentially bring some of these cases in an international setting.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo Kim, who could punish Russia in all of this and what kind of punishment could they face?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nSo the clearest, most direct way to punishing Russia for a crime that has been heard and there's been a guilty conviction, is in Ukrainian court. And in fact, that's happened already. There's been eight cases, mostly kind of junior Russian military personnel who are prisoners of war, who've been accused of crimes, and they've convicted eight of these people already. And one of the ones that features in our story is a guy who shells an apartment building in Kharkiv. No one was killed, but nevertheless, under Ukrainian law, they charged him and gave him a 10 year sentence.\n\nNow, some of the more high level people, those people are inside Russia. And it's sort of an open question about whether they will ever be dragged into a courtroom in an international setting, because if they don't leave Russia, it's going to be hard to arrest them essentially years from now that is possible if there's a different government in Russia, and some of these officials travel abroad, and if there's an arrest warrant out for them, they could be detained somewhere. But essentially for the bigger cases and the big names, it's kind of a long term game.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor more, stay with our daily updates page from Ukraine on USATODAY.com. And you can find Kim's piece with a link in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden is set to announce today that he'll forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers who fall below an income cap. The cancellation would apply to borrowers from households that make $125,000 or less, and would apply only to federal loans, not private ones. The move will also likely include an extension until January on the moratorium of federal student loan payments. That was implemented during the pandemic, but set to expire this month. AP education reporter Collin Binkley has more.\n\nCollin Binkley:\n\nIt's a decision that's long awaited at a very politically polarized, but is expected to bring relief to millions of student loan borrowers across the country. At the same time, he also extended a student loan freeze that allows borrowers to put off their payments during the pandemic. Calls for student debt cancellation have been increasing for years as just the total amount of student debt in the country continues to balloon. Since 2007, the total amount of student debt has tripled. It's now one of the largest forms of personal debt, there are proponents who say that by canceling that it will bring relief to Americans who buy houses, cars, who haven't been able to make other important milestones in their lives because they're so burdened by this debt.\n\nPolitically, it was a really thorny issue for President Biden. There's so many factions with strong opinions around student debt and what to do about it. First from the right, Republicans are opposed to any form of student debt cancellation. They say that it's sort of an unfair handout, that it helps wealthier Americans at the expense of taxpayers who didn't go to college. They say that it's going to worsen inflation and be a big cost for the nation.\n\nOn the left, you get a variety of opinions. The most extreme, there are groups who say that 50,000 is the minimum that President Biden should cancel. There are some that say that all student debt should just be eliminated entirely. There are some that say that $10,000 is okay as a start. Yeah, no doubt, this will continue to be a political issue going into the midterms. And we could see even a lengthy legal challenge to it, which could delay the actual cancellation for some time. So whether the money actually gets erased before voters go to the polls is kind of up in the air.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBook bans in schools have landed librarians in activists' cross hairs. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with Education reporter Alia Wong, who says the movement to band books from schools is bringing vitriol toward them.\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nLibraries are being entangled in debates over what type of content kids should have access to specifically content about sex and gender identity in many cases about race as well. So these debates have really centered libraries, including in what's in their collections. Many activists, some of them parents, have called on libraries to remove certain books from their collections on the grounds that they're inappropriate or too graphic. In some cases they've asked libraries to simply move certain books from children's shelves to adult shelves. In many cases, the controversies aren't even over books specifically, but rather about displays, such as what books library is promoting say during Pride month or what kind of signage it has surrounding certain books.\n\nLibrary programming has also come under scrutiny. Perhaps most notoriously earlier this summer, activists affiliated with the alt-right group, the Proud Boys stormed some library events known as Drag Queen Story Hour in which drag queens read story books to children. And these events have been stormed and disrupted by protestors. So we really see libraries - because of their books, because of their programming, because of their efforts at inclusivity - are really becoming prime targets for a lot of the outrage.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo this obviously makes the job of a librarian harder. Are we going to see a shortage of people in those positions or are we already starting to see that?\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nYeah. These challenges, the pressure, in many cases the harassment and intimidation, it really has taken a toll on librarians. There are many instances in which librarians have basically quit or at least considered quitting because of these circumstances. But the shortages of librarians, they've been a problem for at least the past decade. A pair of researchers has been studying the trends specifically in school librarians and have found that over the past decade, the country has seen a 20% reduction in the number of school librarians. And that pattern only became more entrenched during the pandemic in the 2021/2022 school year. So the most recent school year, 30% of all school districts - so not just even schools, but entire school districts, entire school systems - didn't have a single librarian.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Uvalde School Board in Texas has called for a special meeting today to consider firing School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo. He led the disastrous police response to the elementary school massacre that killed 19 students and two teachers in May. A special Texas House committee investigating the shooting found that he failed to act quickly enough to shoot and kill the gunmen. Officers stormed a classroom more than an hour after entering the school. They waited outside in the hallway, even as students on the other side of the door called 911 for help multiple times. Parents and community members have been calling for Arredondo to be fired along with the other five district officers who responded to the shooting and other district leaders.\n\n♦\n\nA teenager today could become the youngest person to fly around the world in a small plane. Belgian British 17-year-old Mack Rutherford touched down yesterday near the city of Charleroi, Belgium, where he originally learned to fly. His journey began on March 23rd and took him through 52 countries over five continents, crossing the equator twice to meet Guinness World Record requirements. His sister Zara also already set the record for the youngest woman to fly solo around the world at the age of 19. Their father, Sam Rutherford was beaming with pride.\n\nSam Rutherford:\n\nI'm feeling really, really happy. Very, very proud. They've both done extremely well. They have gone around the world safely, effectively, professionally, and they've shown to other youngsters that you don't have to be 18 even, and certainly not 30 to make a difference and do something and follow your dreams. And I think that's really important. So I'm very, very proud of them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMack Rutherford is due to land in Bulgaria today.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

In addition to extending the existing payment pause, borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness. So, what steps do eligible borrowers need to take ? Nearly 8 million borrowers may be able to receive debt forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information. For those who need to provide this data, the Biden administration said it will launch a new application in the coming weeks.\n\n2. Kobe Bryant\n\nA federal jury awarded $31 million in damages after finding the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Fire departments liable for infringing on the constitutional rights of Vanessa Bryant and co-plaintiff Christopher Chester, who each lost a spouse and daughter in the helicopter crash in January 2020 . Bryant was awarded $16 million in damages and Chris Chester was awarded $15 million. The lawsuit said LA County deputies and firefighters took photos of not just wreckage from the helicopter, but also the mangled bodies of those killed -- including NBA star Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, Chester's wife Sarah, his daughter Payton and five others. Bryant and Chester testified they live in fear the photos may surface, despite LA County's assertion each picture had been destroyed.\n\nJUST WATCHED Kobe Bryant's widow leaves court in tears after moment in court Replay More Videos ...

Uvalde\n\nThe Uvalde school board voted unanimously Wednesday to immediately terminate the contract of district police chief Pete Arredondo , three months after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. Arredondo has come under intense public scrutiny over the law enforcement response to the May 24 massacre , America's deadliest school shooting since 2012. During the attack, the shooter remained in two adjoined classrooms for more than an hour before officers entered the rooms and killed him, authorities say. The delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that calls for police to immediately stop the threat. State officials identified Arredondo as the on-scene police commander, though he has said he did not consider himself in charge.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Turn in your badge': Child demands Chief Arredondo be fired Replay More Videos ...

Abortion\n\nA number of restrictive state abortion laws, including so-called trigger laws, are set to take effect this week , putting access to abortion further out of reach for millions of women as Republican-led states rush to limit the procedure following the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade . Trigger laws in three states -- Idaho, Tennessee and Texas -- will take effect today, banning abortions in their respective states with few exceptions. On Friday, North Dakota's trigger law that bans abortions in most circumstances is set to take effect. And on Saturday, an Oklahoma law enacting higher criminal penalties for performing illegal abortions takes effect, adding to the state's already tough laws prohibiting the procedure. The laws will impact about 10 million women of reproductive age (15-49) across those five states.\n\nJUST WATCHED GOP governor: Red states need to expand support for families after banning abortion Replay More Videos ...

The attack was one of several Russian strikes carried out in the region on Ukrainian Independence Day. Also on Wednesday, the US said it will provide Ukraine with counter-unmanned aerial systems \"to shoot missiles out of the sky.\" Separately, Russia's defense minister today said Russian authorities will provide the necessary assistance for an inspection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant . Western leaders and several other officials have stressed the need for the United Nations nuclear watchdog to visit the plant in southeastern Ukraine, where shelling has sparked fears of a potential disaster.\n\nJUST WATCHED Six months of war, 31 years of independence: Where does Ukraine stand now?

But I've been double vaccinated, double boosted. Symptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns. But I'm doing well, getting a lot of work done. Going to continue to get it done and in the meantime, thanks for your concern and keep the faith. It's gonna be OK,\" Biden, who was unmasked while standing outside on the Truman Balcony, said in the 20-second video the White House says was filmed by a masked and socially distanced videographer.\n\nThe mild symptoms and diagnosis protocol for Biden -- a double-boosted 79-year-old at high risk for experiencing severe illness -- will mean isolating and \"working and resting\" at the White House residence for the rest of the day, according to a senior administration official. This is the first time Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, and he last tested negative on Tuesday, per White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nBiden has called several people in the hours since his diagnosis. He wrote on Twitter Thursday afternoon that he is \"doing great\" following the positive test and said he called Pennsylvania politicians to send his regrets about having to cancel a scheduled trip to the commonwealth. The tweet was accompanied by an image of the President smiling at a desk, without a mask, in the residence of the White House.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is seen in this photo shared to Twitter, after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, July 21.\n\nIn a memo that was sent to staff obtained by CNN, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden will be working over the phone and on video conference for the next few days following the positive result.\n\n\"I've spoken to him several times this morning already about an array of matters, and he is focused on our pending business,\" Klain wrote on Thursday.\n\nDay Zero\n\nBiden tested positive for Covid-19 Thursday morning and has begun taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor's prescription.\n\n\"Consistent with (US Center for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,\" Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nThursday marks \"Day 0\" of the President's Covid-19 timeline -- meaning he will be in isolation until at least next Tuesday in accordance to the CDC's guidelines.\n\nThe President's symptoms include \"rhinorreha (or 'runny nose') and fatigue, with an occasional dry cough, which started yesterday evening,\" according to a letter from the President's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor. Biden did not have a fever Thursday morning, White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told CNN.\n\nJha later told reporters that Biden's oxygen levels were \"normal\" as of Thursday morning and that Biden's Covid-19 virus sample has been sent to a lab to identify the specific variant he is infected with. Results are expected in \"less than a week.\"\n\nBiden first tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test Thursday morning as part of routine screening, and the positive result was later was confirmed by a PCR test, his physician said.\n\nO'Connor also noted that the President met the FDA's criteria for use of the antiviral Paxlovid, adding, \"I anticipate that he will respond favorably, as most maximally protected patients do.\"\n\nDue to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the CDC says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nJha said Thursday that Biden has the \"full set of protections\" to deal with Covid-19 at his advanced age.\n\n\"The bottom line is given how much immunity he has from vaccines, given that he was started on treatments right away ... I think all of those things very dramatically reduce his risk of serious illness,\" Jha told CNN's Jeff Zeleny during the White House press briefing. \"And that's really the goal here, is to prevent serious illness, to keep that risk as low as possible. I think he's gotten that full set of protections.\"\n\nBiden received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination on March 30.\n\nStaff takes measures to adapt, Harris and first lady keep their previous schedules\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden tested negative on Thursday.\n\nJean-Pierre indicated that the West Wing will continue to practice its current protocols but that the White House residential staff will be taking measures to create a \"very minimal footprint\" to avoid infecting others.\n\nThe number of aides who staff the White House residence will be reduced to the \"bare minimum\" in light of Biden's positive Covid-19 diagnosis, an official told CNN.\n\nAnd a mid-level West Wing aide who works in close proximity to Biden and was on his recent trip to the Middle East also tested positive for Covid-19, according to two sources familiar. The person is not considered a close contact of the President and tested positive earlier this week.\n\nHarris is expected to keep her normal schedule while Biden isolates. The senior administration official said there are no plans and no need to transfer executive powers to Harris -- as was done last November for 85 minutes, when Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy.\n\nHarris has been identified as a close contact of Biden, a White House official told CNN. Harris last saw Biden on Tuesday and tested negative on Thursday. She is a close contact, an additional aide says, because they spent more than 15 minutes together while being briefed on the presidential daily brief. The White House official added that Harris will follow CDC guidelines for those who are vaccinated, including wearing a well-fitting mask while around people for 10 days from the date of the last close contact.\n\nThe first lady and the vice president said they had both spoken to the President on Thursday following the diagnosis.\n\nJill Biden told reporters in Detroit earlier Thursday that she had spoken to the President and that \"he's doing fine. He's feeling good.\"\n\nThe first lady, her spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN, will keep her original schedule on Thursday, which includes a stop in Georgia before heading to Wilmington, Delaware. She is also double boosted, LaRosa said.\n\nAnd Thursday afternoon, Harris said at an event in North Carolina that the President \"is in good spirits.\"\n\n\"He is working from the White House residence and when he spoke he was very pleased that we are all together today,\" she told her audience, adding that Biden told her to \"tell everybody hello.\"\n\nUpcoming presidential travel canceled\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden's scheduled travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, later on Thursday for a speech on crime prevention has been canceled. A DNC fundraiser Biden was scheduled to headline Thursday night has been postponed, officials said.\n\nIt's yet to be determined whether the event will be rescheduled or if donors will be asked to make their pledged contributions.\n\nBiden was also scheduled to travel to Orlando and Tampa, Florida, on Monday, but now he's expected to be isolating.\n\nBiden has ramped up his engagement with the public over the past year as the White House has shifted its approach toward the pandemic. On Wednesday, Biden traveled to Somerset, Massachusetts, for an event on climate executive actions, where he was seen shaking hands and greeting attendees in the outdoor crowd.\n\nThe President's positive diagnosis comes less than a week after a swing through the Middle East, where he held meetings with world leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. While abroad, Biden was seen shaking hands, bumping fists and embracing other leaders.\n\nThe White House is currently working on contact tracing for those who may have been close contacts of Biden, per an official, since his positive Covid test. They plan to inform any close contacts on Thursday, including members of Congress and the press.\n\nAt least one member of Congress who was a close contact after seeing Biden in Massachusetts received a contact tracing call from the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe White House reached out to the lawmaker's office Thursday afternoon, according to a source familiar, and advised the member of Congress to follow the CDC recommendations for what an individual should do when they're determined to be a close contact.\n\nOne of the recommendations, for example, for someone who is fully vaccinated and was a close contact is to wear a well-fitting mask while around other people for 10 days from the date of last close contact.\n\nWhite House prepared for this moment\n\nWhite House officials have been preparing for months for what many viewed as the inevitability that Biden would come down with Covid.\n\nA wave of cases -- including among Harris , White House staffers and members of Congress -- has swept Washington through the spring and summer. And as more and more of his top officials and members of his family contracted Covid, officials came to believe it was possible the President himself would get sick, even as they took steps to shield him from the virus.\n\nKlain, in his Thursday memo to staff, wrote that White House officials \"have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the President -- like anyone else -- could get Covid, and we have prepared for this possibility. We are now executing on our plan so that the President can continue to work seamlessly from the Residence.\"\n\nBiden last underwent an annual physical in November at Walter Reed National Medical Center. O'Connor wrote in a memo at the time that the President remained \"fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.\"\n\nOfficials had a loose plan in place for the day Biden tested positive, including informing the public when the tests were confirmed and releasing a letter from Biden's physician -- which both took place on Thursday.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump issued a 1 a.m. ET tweet on October, 2, 2020, announcing that both he and then-first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. And Biden officials have been mindful of how the previous administration handled Trump's diagnosis and have been intent on being more forthcoming about Biden's condition.\n\nNow, more than two years into the pandemic, Biden has become the second sitting US president to test positive for Covid-19. His mild symptoms so far stand in stark contrast to Trump's diagnosis before a vaccine was available in 2020 -- a Covid infection that led to a multi-day hospitalization at Walter Reed.\n\nCovid emergency continues\n\nThe President's infection comes as Covid cases are once again on the rise in the US, driven by the most contagious strain of the virus yet -- BA.5. More than 1 million people have died of Covid-19 across the country since the pandemic began.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing the Covid-19 public health emergency as it seeks new funding from Congress for treatments and vaccines. The public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Medicare has also relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more seniors can access such services during the declaration. And states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/health/covid-reinfection-risk/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 reinfections may increase the likelihood of new health ...", "text": "(CNN) Repeatedly catching Covid-19 appears to increase the chances that a person will face new and sometimes lasting health problems after their infection, according to the first study on the health risks of reinfection.\n\nThe study, which is based on the health records of more than 5.6 million people treated in the VA Health System, found that, compared with those with just one Covid-19 infection, those with two or more documented infections had more than twice the risk of dying and three times the risk of being hospitalized within six months of their last infection. They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron's BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n\"If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it's really, really rare,\" Al-Aly said. That's not true anymore, though.\n\n\"So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you're on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.\"\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded -- meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that's not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n\"There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you're getting it again, maybe it doesn't affect you that much, but that's not really true,\" he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn't mean there aren't people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn't get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren't, either.\n\n\"It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,\" Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn't interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n\"The most relevant question to people's lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,\" he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can't determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person's underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n\"There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that 'if I survived my first infection, that I'm really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn't be any problem,' \" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n\"The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,\" Griffin said of the study on the podcast \"This Week in Virology.\" But that's not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it's supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift -- as influenza does -- our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n\"A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,\" Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he's seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it's not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he's seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n\"We don't really see much of that with the flu,\" Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic. That doesn't mean that the pandemic is done with us, though.\n\nOsterholm said he has three close friends who recently went to a restaurant for the first time since the pandemic started. All of them tested positive within 72 hours of that restaurant visit.\n\nIf you're at higher risk of serious illness or you just want to avoid getting sick, it's a good time to be wearing an N95 mask in public places, he says.\n\n\"People don't want to hear it, but that's the reality.

But for anyone under the age of 50, only one booster is authorized.\n\nThe officials had less to offer younger adults at the briefing, other than to say that the US Food and Drug Administration is considering second boosters for this age group.\n\nAs of the end of June, adults under age 50 had the highest rates of Covid-19 cases compared to other age groups, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I know that the FDA is considering this, looking at it,\" Jha said Tuesday of second boosters for younger adults. \"And I know CDC scientists are thinking about this and looking at the data, as well. The decision is purely up to them.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed Wednesday in an appearance on CNN that the idea was being \"actively considered.\" But beyond that, he made no promises, saying the OK on expanding eligibility had to come from the FDA.\n\nIn the meantime, Americans under 50 are watching the lightning spread of the BA.5 subvariant and wondering about their own protection.\n\n'Frustrating and scary'\n\n\"It's frustrating and, frankly, scary,\" said Jennifer O'Neill, 42, who lives in Boston with her 74-year-old mother. O'Neill says she's been waiting on the government to expand eligibility for boosters to younger adults and doesn't understand why it hasn't happened yet.\n\nBoth O'Neill and her mom have had all the boosters they're eligible for, but O'Neilll's last shot was around Thanksgiving. She believes that booster protected her during their first family dinner in two years. Four of the 10 guests at Thanksgiving dinner caught Covid-19, but O'Neill and her mom didn't get sick.\n\n\"I know it's not the same variant. I know in my head it won't prevent transmission entirely, but I am just so concerned with her not getting sick that I'll do whatever I can,\" O'Neill said of her mother, whose age puts her at high risk of more severe illness. \"And it frustrates me that I can't because of eight years.\"\n\nAbout 139 million adults in the US are between 18 and 50, according to Census data. Many of them followed public health guidance and got boosters as soon as they became eligible last fall, when the original Omicron strain was tearing across the country.\n\nData from the UK shows that the effectiveness of booster shots against symptomatic disease caused by the Omicron variant is higher than 60% starting about four weeks after a third dose. After eight weeks, though, it starts to decline, and by five months post-booster, people have almost no protection against symptomatic infections.\n\nSo whatever protection young adults had against infection from last fall's booster is probably long gone.\n\nThat may be disheartening, but it's also not really what the vaccines were designed to do, says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOther ways to protect yourself\n\nIf protection against Covid-19 is your goal, you may be better served by using a combination of other tools, like wearing high-quality masks, making sure you're spending time in well-ventilated spaces with clean air and, if you have the luxury, being choosy about your social contact.\n\n\"These vaccines don't prevent mild infection,\" Shaffner said, and they don't keep you from infecting others. \"These are personal protection vaccines, rather than vaccines that prevent transmission in any substantial way.\"\n\nThe vaccines and boosters continue to offer stronger protection against Covid-19 infections that are severe enough to need hospital or ICU care, or that might be fatal.\n\nHowever, this protection is also slipping over time.\n\nFor adults ages 18 to 64, the effectiveness of a booster against Covid-19 hospitalization peaks around 82.4%, but it drops to about 53.6% about four months after the third shot, according to UK data. For adults over the age of 65, boosters are initially about 86% effective at keeping people out of the hospital, but that protection drops to 77% after roughly four months.\n\nProtection against death from Covid-19 falls to about 48% roughly six months after a second vaccine dose in adults 50 and older. Boosters initially restore that protection to about 94%, but that falls to 88% after 10 weeks or so, according to UK data. There was comparable data available for younger adults.\n\nIn the US, CDC data presented at the White House Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday shows that adults over the age of 50 who've had one booster dose had four times the risk of dying from Covid-19 compared with those who've had at least two booster doses.\n\nSchaffner says people who are under 50 and generally healthy are still in good shape when it comes to severe outcomes from Covid-19.\n\nBut, he says, if you are under 50 and have an underlying health condition like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, you should ask for a second booster even if you're not officially eligible.\n\n\"People are not usually quizzed too thoroughly,\" Shaffner said. \"I would just come up and say 'Hi, I've got bad diabetes' or 'I have underlying heart disease' and stuff like that, and at least in our neck of the woods, you'll be able to get a vaccine.\"\n\nHow to feel safe?\n\nthat qualify people for additional doses if they're under 50. O'Neill tried to get a fourth shot. She didn't lie; she has asthma and pleaded her case at two pharmacies, but they pointed her to a narrow list of conditions that qualify people for additional doses if they're under 50.\n\n\"I'm in Massachusetts, but the two pharmacists were very adamant, like I could get in trouble if I don't follow guidelines,\" she said.\n\nHer friends have told her to lie, but she doesn't feel comfortable doing that. \"I want to follow protocol,\" she said.\n\nShe's frustrated by what she sees as mixed messaging from the Biden administration on Covid-19.\n\n\"It's like 'Get out! Get back to normal!' OK. But I'm only comfortable actually getting out if I feel like I'm fully protected, and I know that the booster won't prevent transmission, it would just make me feel much more safe,\" she said. So she'll continue to limit her activities until she can get a booster.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWith or without vaccines, Jha said, there are things people can do to protect themselves if they do fall ill, including seeking treatment.\n\n\"We have highly effective treatments that work against BA.5, including Paxlovid.

Schiff said in a Tuesday tweet that he was \"feeling fine,\" and Castro reported in his own of \"experiencing mild symptoms.\" Owens did not have close contact with Biden or the first lady prior to her test, according to a statement from Celadon Books.\n\nLaRosa, who had tested negative earlier this week after attending the Gridiron dinner, confirmed to CNN on Thursday that he was experiencing mild symptoms and isolating at home.\n\nThough typically in close contact with the first lady, LaRosa only saw her briefly Thursday at the White House. He told CNN his interaction with Jill Biden had lasted less than 15 minutes and that they were several feet apart, which under CDC guidance means the first lady was not considered a close contact.\n\nVice president a close contact\n\nHarris had been in close contact with Simmons, who tested positive on Wednesday, press secretary Kirsten Allen said.\n\n\"The Vice President will follow CDC guidance for those that have been in close contact with a positive individual and will continue to consult with her physician.

Visitors are expected to be tested for Covid-19 before attending official White House events.\n\nSimmons' case isn't the first to touch the White House.\n\nLast month, second gentleman Doug Emhoff tested positive for the virus, marking the first known case of Covid-19 among the first or second families since Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in January 2021.

The FDA had previously allowed additional shots for anyone 12 or older who was severely immune-deficient. This group of people can now receive a three-dose primary series and two boosters for a total of five doses.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed suit, saying it is updating its vaccine pages to reflect the FDA's expanded eligibility.\n\n\"Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals. Based on an analysis of emerging data, a second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release.\n\n\"Additionally, the data show that an initial booster dose is critical in helping to protect all adults from the potentially severe outcomes of COVID-19. So, those who have not received their initial booster dose are strongly encouraged to do so.\"\n\nThe FDA said that in making its decision, it had determined that the known and potential benefits of second boosters outweigh the known and potential risks for these populations.\n\nThe CDC also said in its statement that adults who got Johnson & Johnson's vaccine as their primary and first booster shots at least four months prior may now get an additional booster of Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna's vaccines.\n\n\"Boosters are safe, and people over the age of 50 can now get an additional booster 4 months after their prior dose to increase their protection further,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in the statement. \"This is especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from COVID-19 as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time.\"\n\nShe said that both the CDC and the FDA \"continue to evaluate the need for additional booster doses for all Americans.\"\n\nThe CDC's update is what's known as a permissive recommendation, a statement that the shots may be used in this age group for those who want them, reflecting a degree of uncertainty in the science. But it's not an official recommendation.\n\nThe lack of a clear endorsement for second boosters punts the work of weighing the risks and benefits of another vaccine dose to individuals, and it has caused no small amount of consternation for some vaccine advocates who say the marginal extra protection some may get won't be worth the confusion fourth doses create.\n\nDr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine physician who is the academic dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, says that throughout the pandemic, officials have been faced with making policy before they've had enough evidence to back it. Ranney sees this as another example.\n\nShe says it's not clear whether everybody needs a fourth dose right now, but having these approvals in place will provide flexibility to roll more boosters out quickly if they're needed.\n\n\"I see this approval from the Biden administration as being an insurance policy on their part,\" Ranney says. \"It's a way to allow people to get the vaccine or the additional booster. But it also provides them with the flexibility so that should BA.2 be worse than we're expecting, they can then quickly roll it out. or God forbid, should there be another variant in the next couple of months that requires another booster they can quickly roll it out. So I'm reading it that way,\" Ranney said.\n\nThere is general scientific agreement that third doses help strengthen immunity against severe illness from the virus that causes Covid-19. But the science is far from settled on when, or even if, fourth doses might be needed since the vaccines continue to offer a high degree of protection against Covid-19 hospitalization and death, even as protection against illness wanes.\n\nMuch of the evidence examining the safety and effectiveness of a second booster shot comes from Israel, which has been recommending a fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine to adults 18 and older since the end of January.\n\nThe FDA said that in making its decision, it had reviewed data from Israel's Ministry of Health on more than 700,000 people 18 and up who had received second boosters of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least four months after their first booster. More than 600,000 of those people were over 60. The agency said that data had revealed no new safety problems tied to a fourth dose.\n\nThe FDA said data on the safety of the Moderna boosters, when used as a fourth dose, comes from a study of 120 people ages 18 and older who got a fourth dose of the vaccine at least four months after their third shot of the Pfizer vaccine. No new safety concerns were identified in the three weeks following the last dose.\n\nSome of the data the FDA relied on to make its decision comes from previously published studies.\n\nIn a large study of more than half a million adults over the age of 60, those who received a second booster, or fourth dose, of a Covid-19 vaccine had 78% lower odds of death during the Omicron wave compared to those who had a third shot at least four months earlier. But the numbers of deaths were relatively low in both groups. After 40 days of follow up, there were 232 total deaths out of nearly 234,000 people who'd only had three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, compared with 92 deaths out of 328,000 people.\n\nsmaller study of health care workers, which included younger adults, found that fourth boosters were safe and restored antibodies to the same levels reached after third doses. But fourth doses were only moderately effective -- about 30 to 40% -- at preventing illness. And most of the workers who got sick still had high viral loads, suggested that they were capable of transmitting the infection to others.\n\nAdditional studies from the UK show that the antibody boost from a booster dose wanes very quickly, within a matter of weeks. So some experts feel that considering available resources and the diminishing appetite to continue to get more and more boosters, that the United States should wait until there's a clear danger from a new wave of infections to roll out fourth doses. Some see the likely timing of that to be next fall.\n\n\"If you have only one bullet in your gun to shoot, I would prefer to hold fire until the fall, because that's when cases may really start to increase,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSince January, Americans 12 and older have been eligible for a third vaccine dose, but only 46% of that demographic group has had a third shot.\n\nSchaffner says he's worried that fourth doses will just confuse people who haven't decided to get a third dose.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about dividing and not being able to conquer because the messaging will get very, very confusing,\" he said, \"And so I think public health officials and clinicians ought to be continuing to focus on getting the third dose into people who are eligible.\"", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/free-covid-tests-wbsite-beta-launched/index.html", "title": "Website to order free Covid-19 tests is up and running", "text": "(CNN) The federal government launched its website to sign up for free Covid-19 tests , allowing people to order a maximum of four tests shipped directly to their household.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Tuesday that the government website to order free Covid-19 tests is up and running.\n\nHave you tried to get a free home test from the federal site?

Nearly 10 million people are under flood watches as excessive rainfall is expected dump 2 to 4 inches across Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Utah. Earlier this week, the Weather Prediction Center issued a rare \"moderate risk\" (Level 3 out of 4) for today in preparation for the surge of rain expected this weekend. The drought-plagued region is already dealing with a water crisis , so they need the rain, but it may not be as beneficial as you might think. One of the concerns with the upcoming downpours is that they might not surge far enough north or west where the water is needed most: California, Nevada, Oregon, and northern Utah.

January 6\n\nThe January 6 committee presented new evidence Thursday highlighting then-President Donald Trump's refusal over three hours to publicly condemn the riot at the US Capitol or to call off the violent mob. During the primetime session, witnesses with firsthand knowledge of what was happening inside the White House on January 6 told the committee that Trump did not place a single call to law enforcement or national security officials as the insurrection was unfolding. Nor did he issue a statement during that time urging rioters to leave the Capitol and go home. The committee used that testimony to make a case that Trump's refusal to intervene amounted to a dereliction of duty.

On the front of the computer is two USB-C ports that double as Thunderbolt ports and an SD card slot.\n\nAlso unveiled by Apple: a separate 27-inch Mac Studio Display, which will work with the Mac Studio as well as other MacBooks and the Mac Mini. It features a 12-megapixel camera, six speakers and spatial audio support.\n\nMore powerful M1 Ultra chip revealed\n\nIf the M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max processing chips for Macs just aren't enough, Apple announced it has developed a fourth option called M1 Ultra. Apple says it's eight times faster than the standard M1 chip.\n\nSo what does that mean for Macs? Computers with the Ultra chip will likely run beefier software like video editing programs with greater speed and efficiency. Meanwhile, other apps and tools will run even faster, according to Apple.\n\niPad Air: New model for $599 unveiled\n\nIt's iPad's turn. Cook just unveiled a revamped iPad Air, which is the company's thinner, lighter version of its popular tablet.\n\nThe iPad Air will add the M1 chip, which will give the iPad Air a big bump in graphics and processing performance, said Apple.\n\nThe iPad Air will also feature a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and will add the Center Stage feature, a cool tool used to help keep users centered on the screen during video calls. The new Air will also support 5G.\n\nThe tablet will be compatible with accessories like Apple's magic keyboard and the second generation of Apple Pencil.\n\nThe iPad will launch March 18 starting at $599. It will be available in multiple colors, including space gray, starlight and blue.\n\nNew iPhone SE starts at $429\n\nApple confirmed the new iPhone SE, which will include a 4.7-inch screen and support for Touch ID, will launch on March 18 at $429.\n\niPhone SE with 5G announced\n\nCook introduced what we all expected: a new iPhone SE. The big takeaway thus far is it will use the A15 processing chip, which is the same as in the iPhone 13. It's twice as fast as an iPhone 7 and nearly twice as fast as iPhone 8, according to Apple. It also appears the home button will remain on the SE model.\n\nThe phone will be available in three colors: midnight, starlight, and red. It will also support 5G.\n\nGreen iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro\n\nThe iPhone 13 is now available in two new shades of green. The iPhone 13 will soon be available in a forest green color, while the iPhone 13 Pro will arrive in a lighter alpine green finish.\n\nBaseball on Apple TV+\n\nMajor League Baseball is making its debut on Apple TV+. Well, that's if baseball actually comes back this season. Friday Night Baseball will feature two games every Friday during the season only available on its platform.\n\nTim Cook starts with Apple TV+\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook kicks things off with the livestream directly from Apple Park in California.\n\nHe begins with Apple TV+, one of many streaming services occupying our time during the pandemic. Cook introduces several original films coming soon to the platform, featuring some big name actors including Mahershala Ali, Denzel Washington, and Ryan Reynolds.\n\nApple event: How to watch online\n\nIf you want to follow along and watch the Apple event streamed online, you have a couple options.\n\nApple says it will stream the event from its website, as well as through the Apple TV app. When you visit the app, you will likely see an image of the invite to select, which takes you directly to the stream.\n\nIf you don't have Apple TV, the company will also stream through its YouTube channel.\n\nWhy call it 'Peek performance?'\n\nWith every invite comes speculation about the language Apple uses. In this case: \"Peek performance.\"\n\nForrester analyst Thomas Husson said don't be surprised if Apple reveals new hardware including \"a new MacBook Air with a new boosted processor, some other Macs and a new iPad Air.”\n\nFor those hoping Apple may finally reveal some news related to the metaverse, Husson said prepare to be \"disappointed.\"\n\n\"This will be the Apple spring collection not a peek preview of disruptive new product categories,\" he said.\n\nApple's online store is down\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Apple's online store going down would present a problem. But this is just one of the first steps in Apple's dance toward unveiling its new line of devices.\n\n\"Be right back,\" reads a message on Apple's website. \"We're making updates to the Apple Store. Check back soon.\"\n\nThe latest tech news\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/09/13/apple-iphone-mac-ios-operating-system/2810517/", "title": "The week in Tech: 5 must-know things", "text": "Julia Ryan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nApple unveils iPhone 5s%2C iPhone 5c\n\niPhone 5s has fingerprint sensor for purchases%2C phone unlocking\n\nBest Buy to sell new blue HTC One smartphone\n\nThe Internet went crazy earlier this week when Apple unveiled its newest iPhones. The tech giant dominated headlines in a week that also included smartphone announcements from HTC, and new ideas from PayPal about how to improve retail spaces. Here's what you need to know about the week in Tech:\n\n1) Apple introduces new iPhones\n\nApple showed off its long-awaited new smartphones, the colorful iPhone 5c and the next-generation iPhone 5s, at a press event on Wednesday.\n\nHere's what you need to know about both phones:\n\niPhone 5s: The iPhone 5s has an upgraded camera, a faster processor and a fingerprint ID sensor. It has up to 64 GB of storage and about 10 hours of battery life. The phone comes in a new gold tone in addition to silver and \"space gray\" — no more black and white iPhones. The iPhone 5s starts at $199 and will go on sale Sept. 20.\n\niPhone 5c: This is Apple's \"budget phone,\" with a starting price of $99. The phone is available in five colors — white, pink, yellow, blue and green. The iPhone 5c has up to 10 hours of battery life on the 3G network. Apple started pre-orders today for the phone, with an expected delivery date of Sept. 20.\n\n2) New iPhone 5s will read your fingerprints\n\nThe fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s was one of the most talked-about features to come out of Apple's press event.\n\nUSA TODAY's Brett Molina answered 10 questions about how it works. Here are a few highlights:\n\n--Setup: An iPhone user would place and hold their finger on the home button several times. Apple's Touch ID then takes an image of the user's fingerprint.\n\n--How it works: You can use the fingerprint sensor to make purchases in iTunes and the App Store, or to unlock your phone.\n\n--Security: No, Apple isn't going to sell your fingerprint to the NSA. Your fingerprint would be stored in a \"Secure Enclave\" on the smartphone, not on Apple's servers or the iCloud. Apple will also keep third-party app developers from using your fingerprint.\n\n3) With iPhones confirmed, what's next for Apple?\n\nIt might be an understatement to say that expectations are high for Apple right now, in the wake of their latest iPhone release. So what's next? USA TODAY's Ed Baig took a look at a few impending product releases for the next few months.\n\nYou can expect to see a new operating system for Macs sometime in October. The company previewed OS X Mavericks at a developer's conference in June. Baig says we might also get an updated iPad and iPad Mini next month.\n\nAs for new products, Baig says he doesn't expect Apple to come out with its long-rumored Apple TV anytime soon. But we might get a refresh on the Apple TV set-top box. Baig also said he wonders what will happen with the rumored iWatch: \"There's no telling when an iWatch might appear, and Apple — despite the emerging competition — isn't likely to deliver a watch just because others have beaten them to the space. But the clock is ticking.\"\n\n4) Blue HTC One coming to Best Buy; Amazon says it won't launch a free phone\n\nElsewhere in the tech world, HTC released a new version of their HTC One phone and Amazon squashed rumors about a possible Amazon smartphone.\n\nHTC will launch the blue version of their HTC One phone exclusively at Best Buy stores and on BestBuy.com this Sunday, through the end of the year. HTC will offer special pricing for the phone with a two-year contract for most major carriers, except T-Mobile.\n\nAmazon announced it will not be joining the smartphone market, for now. Rumors swirled that the company would offer a smartphone for free, but Amazon quickly shot down the rumors on Monday. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said that if the company \"were to launch a phone in the future, it would not be free.\"\n\n5) PayPal unveils new gadget to help stores ID shoppers\n\nHow great would it be if your favorite store recognized you as you walked in? PayPal CEO David Marcus wants to make that possible with Beacon, a new gadget that he unveiled at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco earlier this week.\n\nThe 3-inch-high stick plugs into a wall socket and helps stores identify PayPal users when they walk in to a store. Beacon also lets customers pay from their smartphones via Bluetooth Low Energy.\n\nExpect to see this in stores soon. Marcus said he has teamed up with \"some large brands\" to roll out the new device in stores in 2014.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/08/11/report-apple-iphone-september/2640021/", "title": "Apple expected to show next iPhone on Sept. 10", "text": "Scott Martin and Jon Swartz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Apple is widely expected to unveil its next-generation iPhone on Sept. 10, during what is an annual product refresh intended to juice its all-important holiday sales.\n\nBut this year, rival Samsung Electronics is poised to deliver some buzzkill to the iPhone's launch with an event timed a week before Apple's, according to a source familiar with Samsung's plans. The Korean electronics giant is expected to unveil a new Galaxy smartphone on Sept. 4 in Berlin. The source was not authorized to disclose the event prematurely.\n\nSamsung had no comment.\n\nSince its first iPhone made its debut in 2007, Apple has faced an endless parade of smartphones running Google's Android software intended for consumers. Wall Street and Apple enthusiasts have been waiting for the company to wow them with a completely new gizmo such as a rumored iWatch smartwatch or iPhones in different sizes and colors.\n\nAll Things D first reported on the Apple event. USA TODAY confirmed the report.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said.\n\nApple's next iPhone release is expected to touch off a wave of buying that could serve as a catalyst for the stock ahead of the holiday season. That's something Apple could use to improve its stature after store sales came in flat in Apple's most recent earnings period.\n\n\"With a new iPhone and revamped iOS coming out later this year, Apple is well-positioned to recapture market share,\" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas says.\n\nStill, Samsung's attack of smartphones in varying sizes and features is hard to keep pace with, and Samsung is expected to steal Apple's iPhone thunder by beating it to the punch with a new Galaxy smartphone in early September, said a source familiar with its plans.\n\nSamsung took 30.4% of the worldwide smartphone market compared with Apple's 13.1% position in the second quarter, according to researcher IDC. Apple held 16.6% of the market a year ago.\n\nAt the same time, smartphones from LG, Lenovo and ZTE have made market inroads, especially in the Asia Pacific region, where Apple is seen as less price competitive. Apple CEO Tim Cook has made repeated visits to China Mobile's headquarters in a bid for that market.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, stepped up its smartphone attack with the Moto X this month.\n\nApple will likely come out with processor and camera advances for its next iPhone. Numerous unconfirmed press reports say it may come up with a fingerprint sensor. That latter move would put to work its acquisition of biometric specialist AuthenTec and allow a one-touch log-in by way of fingerprint-scanning technology.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Apple will move to a larger screen size and offer a cheaper version of the iPhone.\n\nThe radical changes underscore what lengths Apple will go to in order to head off a pack of competitors.\n\nBrett Molina contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/10/13/apples-newest-product-release-talking-tech-podcast/8433837002/", "title": "Apple's newest product release: Talking Tech podcast", "text": "Hit play on the player above to hear the podcast and follow along with the transcript below. This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nDaily news, true crime, and more USA TODAY podcasts\n\nHey, there, listeners. It's Brett Molina. Welcome back to Talking Tech. My co-host Mike Snider is off today.\n\nSo who's ready for yet another Apple event? The tech giant confirmed on Tuesday it's going to host a virtual event on October 18th, during which the company may reveal a new line of MacBook computers as well as potentially a new set of AirPods. The name of the event is Unleashed, according to an invitation that was sent to the media, including us at USA Today.\n\nSo what can we expect from this? Apple is likely going to reveal a new line of MacBook computers. According to a May report from Bloomberg, the company is planning to release models with faster processors and better connectivity to external devices. And this is going to span all Macs, so it's not just the MacBook Pro. We're looking at likely the MacBook Air scene update. Also, some of the Mac minis and the Mac Pros that we've seen previously.\n\nThere's also rumors that Apple could unveil a new version of its AirPod wireless earbuds. The last time we saw a new version of these was I believe around 2019, when they unveiled the second generation AirPods and they introduced us to the AirPods Pro. So we'll see. There was rumors that we were going to see this last month when Apple introduced the iPhone 13, but that didn't happen, and a lot of the rumors seem to be pointing to this month as the time we might see them. So it is very possible next week we'll get a new line of AirPods as well.\n\nThere is obviously history to this. If you're wondering whether MacBook seemed the most likely choice for this event, last November, Apple unveiled a new line of MacBooks that was running on its own in-house chips, which was the first time that their Macs would run on something that wasn't made by Intel since 2005. Of course, as you know, last year with the pandemic, everything got pushed up. So that September iPhone event was actually in October last year, and then their event for the MacBook and all things Mac was pushed a month to November.\n\nSo in light of that, it sounds like we're most likely going to get these MacBooks. We're probably going to get an update on Mac OS and when the next version of that's going to come out. And then the really big question is what's up with AirPods? Do we see new AirPods? Are they going to wait? We'll know for sure next week on October 18th. Be sure to follow tech.USAtoday.com for all the latest on that.\n\nListeners, let's hear from you.

The iPhone 13 will start at $699 for the Mini model, all the way up to the iPhone 13 Pro Max at $1,099.\n\n►Don't miss a moment:Huge innovations to how-tos, follow the latest tech news with the Talking Tech newsletter\n\n\"Our customers rely on iPhone every day, which is why we’ve made iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini more powerful, more capable, and more fun to use,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in a statement.\n\nThis year's release features several subtle upgrades to the iPhone, which will remain popular due to \"pent up demand\" for a new Apple phone, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nAbout 250 million of the 975 million iPhones already sold have not been upgraded in more than 3.5 years, said Ives.\n\n►Do you own an iPhone or iPad? Update your Apple devices right now.\n\n►History of the iPhone:How Apple's signature smartphone has changed over the years\n\niPhone 13 features\n\nThe iPhone 13 will be available in five colors: red, starlight (a whiteish shade), midnight (a blackish shade), blue and pink. The two camera lenses on the back of the smartphone have been placed diagonally.\n\nAlong with the typical upgrades to processing speed, display and battery life, the iPhone 13 adds a Cinematic Mode, which uses an automatic focus to shift between subjects in a video, similar to Portrait Mode for photos.\n\nThe new phone also means the arrival of iOS 15, which will launch as a free software update on Sept. 20. It will include updates to FaceTime, a Live Text feature where users can search text within images, and a Focus mode to manage your notifications.\n\nA new Apple Watch\n\nIt wasn't just the iPhone enjoying the attention at Apple's event. The tech giant also unveiled Apple Watch Series 7, with a larger display and redesigned look to provide more of a wraparound effect.\n\nDigital buttons on the watch face appear bigger to make them easier to tap, such as trying to find snooze on an alarm. The watch will also include new faces to leverage the size of the display.\n\nThe Apple Watch uses the extra screen area to add a predictive text keyboard, so users can quickly type messages by dragging their fingers across the appropriate letters or they can do it the old-fashioned way letter by letter.\n\nApple says the updated watch boasts an 18-hour battery life and charges 33% faster than the Series 6. It's available in multiple colors including midnight, starlight, green and red.\n\nThe Series 7 will start at $399 and launches later this fall.\n\nTwo new iPads, including a revamped Mini\n\nApple also rolled out updates to its iPad line, with new versions of its entry-level model starting at $329 and an overhauled iPad Mini starting at $499.\n\nApple says the new iPad Mini, which will feature an 8.3-inch touchscreen, will perform 80% faster than the previous model. The tablet, available Sept. 24, will include an upgrade to its cameras, support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, and support for 5G wireless networks.\n\nThe entry-level iPad will retain the same design and price but feature more storage starting at 64GB, and add a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with support for Center Stage, a feature on iPad Pro models which can automatically detect and follow who's on screen. It's available on Sept. 24.\n\nScroll down for live updates of Tuesday's Apple event:\n\nWhich iPhone to choose?\n\nHere's a quick rundown of all the iPhones Apple will have available, with iPhone 13 on the list, and its starting price:\n\niPhone SE: $399\n\niPhone 11: $499\n\niPhone 12: $599\n\niPhone 13: $699\n\niPhone 13 Pro: $999\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro is not cheap\n\nBigger phone, bigger screens, bigger battery life and a bigger price tag. The iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999, and the Pro Max starts at $1,099. There's also a storage option for the Pro at 1 terabyte. You can preorder all four new iPhones starting Friday. They reach stores Sept. 24.\n\nA big camera update for iPhone 13 Pro\n\nThe camera features a brand new telephoto lens, Ultra-wide and wide lenses. Low light photos will look brighter and sharper, optical zoom will get a boost, while the system will allow for macro photography to get detailed closeups on objects. The smartphones will also feature Night Mode for taking pictures without proper lighting conditions.\n\nUsers can also personalize their cameras with photographic styles. You can use default templates like rich contrast or vibrant warm, altering the tone and warmth on a photo to create the specific style you want.\n\nApple showcased how the cameras work by putting them in the hands of directors including Kathryn Bigelow. And here I am wasting all this on my dog (but still worth it).\n\nAs for battery life, the 13 Pros last 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro and 2.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.\n\nThere's an iPhone 13 Pro model, too\n\nAnd of course, here comes the info on the Pro model of iPhone 13.\n\nThe Pro comes in four finishes: graphite, gold, silver and sierra blue. They seem to feature a more metallic look compared to the standard models. There's still the three-camera system on the back of the phone as well.\n\nThere's also going to be an iPhone 13 Pro Max, for the Apple fans who love their big screens. Apple said it has the fastest graphics processing of any smartphone, ideal if you enjoy games on your phone.\n\nThe Pro models will have a new Super Retina XDR display, as well as ProMotion, which offers really high refresh rates and adapts depending on the activity. Translation: Scrolling and swiping through your phone will feel more fluid.\n\nThe Pro will have a 6.1-inch screen and Pro Max will have a 6.7-inch screen.\n\nThe iPhone 13 will start at $799\n\nThe iPhone 13 Mini will start at $699 while the iPhone 13 will start at $799. The tech giant is also increasing the storage capability, starting with 128 GB of storage, which is pretty impressive. Both phones top off at 512 GB.\n\nAlso interesting to note Apple hasn't said anything about a Pro or Plus model with a larger screen.\n\nHow's iPhone 13 battery life?\n\nThe big question I have, as well as every other curious smartphone owner, is how long will the battery run? It runs between 1.5-2 hours longer than last year's phones.\n\nThere's a smart data mode that will automatically shift your phone from 5G to LTE to help conserve battery life.\n\nWhat is Cinematic Mode?\n\nAs expected, the iPhone 13 is adding a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which is essentially a version of Portrait Mode for use in videos.\n\nThe feature is capable of highlighting and framing the key elements in a video clip, from people or objects in the background to those who are closer to the camera.\n\nThe mode will anticipate when the focus of the clip changes. Apple said they studied cinematography used in filmmaking to help design the mode. The mode will shoot in Dolby Vision HDR as well.\n\nThe iPhone 13 has arrived\n\nTime for the star of the show, the next iPhone. Cook just unveiled the iPhone 13.\n\nIt has a flat-edged design just like the iPhone 12, and a diagonal arrangement for the dual-camera system in the back. It will be available in five colors.\n\nApple is also bringing back the iPhone Mini model. The display is 28% brighter than last year's phones. The display also boasts improved power efficiency. The standard iPhone 13 has a 6.1-inch screen, while the Mini has a 5.4-inch screen.\n\nThe next iPhone has a brand new chip (shocker) called A15. So, big surprise, it's going to run faster and better than your old iPhone.\n\nApple says the new chip has 50% faster processing than its competition and 30% faster graphics processing.\n\nApple Fitness+ gets an update, too\n\nThe fitness app available for Apple Watch will launch in 15 more countries and include additional types of experiences such as pilates and guided meditation. There are also workouts to help users get ready for snow season activities such as skiing or snowboarding.\n\nThe Fitness+ app will also add Group Workouts using the upcoming SharePlay feature for FaceTime launching on iOS 15. It can support up to 32 people at the same time.\n\nApple Watch Series 7 is here at $399\n\nNext up is the Apple Watch, the company's popular wearable. It will add new features specific to biking, including support for e-bikes and fall detection.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 will boast a new display with 20% more screen area than last year's model. The shape has also been tweaked to feature softer, more rounded corners to create a more seamless wraparound effect. It's also 70% brighter indoors.\n\nButtons of the watch have been made larger to make them easier to find (especially if you're half asleep trying to hit snooze on an alarm). There's also a keyboard on the Apple Watch. Finally. It also has several watch faces aimed at leveraging the additional screen space.\n\nThe Apple Watch is water-resistant and is the first model with dust resistance. It also boasts an 18-hour battery life and charges 33% faster than the Series 6.\n\nIt's available in multiple colors including midnight, starlight, green and product red. Watchbands also feature a fresh variety of colors, too.\n\nThe Series 7 will start at $399. It's available later this fall. Meanwhile, the budget Series 3 will stay at $199, while the Apple Watch SE starts at $279.\n\nThe iPad Mini returns at $499\n\nCook said \"its littlest iPad\" is getting its biggest upgrade ever. It's available in four colors: purple, pink, starlight and space grey. It also boasts an 8.3-inch liquid retina display.\n\nThe top button will also double as a way to use Touch ID option as well. It's 40% faster and 80% faster with graphics processing. So, yeah, it's going to be really fast.\n\nThe iPad Mini features a USB-C port, similar to iPad Air, which they say will result in 10 times faster data transfers, and support third-party devices that also use USB-C. It will also feature 5G.\n\nThe new mini-tablet will also record in 4K and the same camera as the upgraded entry-level iPad, which means it will also support Center Stage.\n\nIt will support the second-generation Apple Pencil, and will have its own line of super -hin Smart Folio cases.\n\nThe iPad Mini starts at $499, available in both Wi-Fi and cellular models. It's available for preorder Tuesday, and launches next week.\n\nApple unveils new iPad at $329\n\nApple plans to roll out a new version of its low-cost iPad model. Apple says the new model will provide 20% faster computer and graphics processing, as well as a stronger neural engine to make services such as Live Text operate more quickly.\n\nThe front-facing camera is now a 12MP Ultra Wide camera and features Center Stage, which makes video calls more engaging by automatically detecting people. It's currently available on Pro models of iPad.\n\nIt maintains a similar design, which allows it to support most third-party peripherals such as the first-generation Apple Pencil and keyboards.\n\nThe iPad will also stick with the same price at $329 but will add 64GB of storage to start, a major upgrade. It will launch next week.\n\nNew shows on Apple TV\n\nCook introduces the audience to new series coming this fall to the tech giant's streaming TV service. Several big names popping up, including Jon Stewart, a new season of The Morning Show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston coming this month, and the science-fiction show called \"Invasion,\" a show called \"The Shrink Next Door\" starring Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell.\n\nThe Apple event has started\n\nWe've officially begun with a musical interlude that appears to take place across different parts of California, performing the song \"California Soul.\"\n\nTim Cook now jumps on stage to sing the praises of California. \"We're proud to call California our home,\" he said.\n\nWhere can I watch the Apple event?\n\nAlong with streaming the event on Apple's website, you can also watch it through YouTube.\n\nRemember, you can also stay on this page and follow the latest news once the event begins at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nApple Store: 'Be right back'\n\nAs expected prior to any Apple event, the company's online store is down since we're going to see new products later Tuesday.\n\n\"Be right back,\" reads the message on Apple's store. \"We're making updates to the Apple store. Check back soon.\"\n\nA new Apple Watch and AirPods, too?\n\nApple typically doesn't only talk iPhone when it hosts (physically or virtually) its September events. We're likely going to see a new version of the Apple Watch as well. According to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, the upgraded Apple Watch Series 7 will sport a new design, larger screens and a faster processor.\n\nMeanwhile, 9to5Mac reports Apple could also introduce a fresh version of its AirPods. The last time Apple rolled out new AirPods was in 2019, said the report.\n\nBeware the iPhone 13 scams\n\nAs buzz rises over the likely unveiling of the iPhone 13, so too are the number of scams linked to Apple's event. Research firm Kaspersky said they have seen intensified scamming activity ahead of the event.\n\nThe schemes often involve fake offers such as snagging the next iPhone before release or getting other deals on products like AirPods.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to let developers use payment options beyond the App Store, which would circumvent Apple's 30% commission on most app transactions.\n\nEpic Games has said it is appealing the judge's decision rejecting Epic's allegations that Apple ran a monopoly.\n\nBy mid-December, Apple must build a framework that would allow developers to steer payments outside of the App Store and Apple's iOS, said Gene Munster, a managing partner with Loup Ventures.\n\nBut \"it won't be until next year that developers can do steering A/B testing,\" Munster said on Twitter. \" Apple will probably make further changes in the next 5 years, which will collectively yield an App Store that is a favorable asset from an investor's standpoint.\"\n\n– Mike Snider\n\n'Pent up demand' for a new iPhone\n\nIn advance of today's event, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives laid out a synopsis of Apple's position, noting that the company \"remains in the midst of its strongest overall product cycle in roughly a decade.\"\n\nThe new line of iPhones, expected to be called the iPhone 13, will be the second model to include 5G wireless connectivity. Apple appears to be boosting production of the new phones beyond that of the iPhone 12, Ives said. His analysis suggests Apple's initial production of about 90 million units surpasses that of the initial iPhone 12 production of 80 million.\n\nThe reasoning? \"This 5G driven product cycle will extend into 2022 and should also benefit from a post-vaccine consumer 'reopening environment,' Ives said.\n\nBeyond that, there is \"pent up demand\" for new iPhones among current customers because about 250 million of the 975 million iPhones already sold have not been upgraded in more than 3.5 years, he said.\n\nThe new wave of iPhones is expected to include \"an eye-popping 1 terabyte storage option,\" twice the highest storage capacity in the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, Ives expects.\n\n– Mike Snider\n\n►iOS 15 is arriving soon:Here's what we know about the iPhone's upcoming update\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}]}

The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.\"\n\nThe President's sweeping plan on student loans follows extended, down-to-the-wire negotiations at the White House among stakeholders and lawmakers ahead of when payments were set to resume at the end of this month. The decision is already disappointing many, with those on the left arguing that the President should have provided even more loan forgiveness and those on the right asserting that Biden is punishing Americans who avoided going into debt. But it fulfills one of Biden's campaign promises, issuing major reforms to America's student loan system and providing relief to millions of current and future borrowers.\n\nBorrowers who hold loans with the Department of Education and make less than $125,000 a year are eligible for up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness if they received Pell Grants, which are given to students from low- and middle-income families. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year but did not receive Pell Grants are eligible for $10,000 in loan forgiveness.\n\nBiden said that the administration's \"targeted actions are for families that need it the most: working and middle class people hit especially hard during the pandemic making under $125,000 a year,\" emphasizing that \"about 90% of the eligible beneficiaries make under $75,000.\"\n\n\"I understand not everything I'm announcing is going to make everybody happy,\" Biden said. \"Some think it's too much -- I find it interesting how some of my Republican friends who voted for those tax cuts think we shouldn't be helping these folks. Some think it's too little, but I believe my plan is responsible and fair. It focuses the benefit of middle-class and working families, it helps both current and future borrowers and it'll fix a badly broken system.\"\n\nThe Department of Education will announce details on how borrowers can claim this relief through an application in the coming weeks. Millions of borrowers will be able to receive relief automatically based on existing income data.\n\nAdditionally, the department is proposing a federal rule aimed at making the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers.\n\nThe proposed rule would change income-based repayment for student loans, cutting in half the amount borrowers would have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans, \"while borrowers with both undergraduate and graduate loans will pay a weighted average rate.\"\n\nThe proposal would also \"raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary income and therefore protected from repayment.\" And it would forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments rather than 20 years under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less, the department said.\n\nThe proposed rule includes other changes, like simplifying borrowers' choices among loan repayment plans.\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nBiden on Wednesday argued that \"the whole economy is better off\" as a result of his new plan.\n\n\"By resuming student loan payments at the same time we provide targeted relief, we're taking an economically responsible course. As a consequence, $50 billion dollars a year will start coming back into the Treasury because of the resumption of debt,\" he said, later adding, \"There is plenty of deficit reduction to pay for the programs ... many times over.\"\n\nAlthough student debt cancellation will deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, it would shift the cost to Uncle Sam.\n\nA one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning up to $125,000 a year could cost the government nearly $300 billion, according to an estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Additional forgiveness for Pell grant recipients was not included in the estimate.\n\nPlus, loan cancellation won't address the root of the problem: college affordability. There is currently $1.6 trillion of outstanding federal student loan debt. The amount of outstanding debt would return to that level in just four years after $10,000 per borrower was canceled, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nWhite House officials on Wednesday could not provide a topline price estimate for the plan, saying too many unknowns exist to calculate how much the plan might eventually cost.\n\nSusan Rice, the White House's domestic policy adviser, said it would depend on how many eligible borrowers sign up through the Department of Education to have their loans relieved.\n\n\"If 43 million borrowers take it up, that'll be different than if 50% of those 43 million take it up,\" Rice said.\n\nStudent loan cancellation also could increase inflation -- though many experts say the effect would be modest, because borrowers generally pay back their student loans over time. They wouldn't receive a lump sum of money if some of their debt is canceled. They would instead be required to pay less money each month toward their student loan payments.\n\n\"The inflationary impact its certainly positive, but I don't think it would be much. We're talking about a pretty small impact,\" said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rampell: This does very little to address the underlying problems Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rampell: This does very little to address the underlying problems 02:21\n\nWarnings over inflation\n\nLarry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary who served as the director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, argued ahead of the announced plan that relief would contribute to inflation.\n\n\"I hope the Administration does not contribute to inflation macro economically by offering unreasonably generous student loan relief or micro economically by encouraging college tuition increases,\" Summers tweeted on Tuesday, later adding, \"Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation. It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.\"\n\nJason Furman, the chairman of former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, added , \"Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless. Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.\"\n\nMarc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- a nonpartisan group that tracks federal spending -- argued against the plan in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on \"Newsroom\" Tuesday morning.\n\nHe believes that canceling $10,000 of debt for each borrower will likely increase inflation, undermine the stated goal of Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act and will not significantly decrease the racial wealth gap.\n\n\"The Inflation Reduction Act saves maybe $300 billion dollars in the first 10 years. If we cancel $10,000 of debt and just extend the pause a few months, we're going to be at about that much in terms of new cost,\" he said. \"All the deficit reduction will be wiped out. At the same time, we're probably going to do more to increase inflation from debt cancellation than any inflation reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act.\"\n\nIt's also not easy to target loan forgiveness to those who need it the most and exclude borrowers with higher salaries. An income threshold that cuts off borrowers who earn more than $125,000 a year could help make sure a bigger proportion of the relief goes to low-income borrowers. But some doctors and lawyers, who will eventually be making high incomes, may also reap the benefits.\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model also breaks down the share of forgiven debt by income group assuming that $10,000 is canceled for borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year and households earning less than $250,000.\n\nIt found that one-third of the canceled dollars would go to households who earn less than $50,795 a year. A little more than half of the debt relief would go to those earning between $50,795 and $141,096.\n\nRoughly 14% of the canceled dollars would go to households earning more than $141,096 a year.\n\nPolitical pressure\n\nBiden has been facing political pressure from the left to broadly cancel student loan debt since taking office.\n\nKey Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had called on Biden to cancel $50,000 per borrower. The President spoke with Schumer, Warren and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia on Tuesday ahead of the expected announcement.\n\nSchumer and Warren said in a joint statement that the decision is \"a giant step forward in addressing the student debt crisis.\"\n\n\"The positive impacts of this move will be felt by families across the country, particularly in minority communities, and is the single most effective action that the President can take on his own to help working families and the economy,\" they added.\n\nEarlier this week amid reports of Biden's plan, NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the reported provisions insufficient and \"not how you treat Black voters.\"\n\nA senior administration official on Wednesday suggested that the relief it will help \"narrow the racial wealth gap.\"\n\nAnd Biden, in his remarks, acknowledged that the burden of student debt \"is especially heavy on Black and Hispanic borrowers, who on average have less family wealth to pay for it. \"\n\nBiden has consistently pushed back on canceling that much, suggesting he would support wiping away $10,000 for borrowers below a certain income threshold. On the campaign trail, Biden called for immediately canceling a minimum of $10,000 in student debt per person as a response to the pandemic, as well as forgiving all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for those borrowers earning up to $125,000 a year. But he had also said he preferred Congress to take action rather than using executive power to do so.\n\nAnd on the right, Republican lawmakers blasted Biden's new relief plan.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the plan is \"yet another way to make inflation even worse\" and \"reward far-left activists.\"\n\n\"President Biden's student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt,\" he continued. \"This policy is astonishingly unfair.\"\n\nAppearing to counter his critics -- particularly Republicans who voted for the Trump tax plan -- the President said on Wednesday he would \"never apologize for helping ... working Americans and the middle class -- especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations.\"\n\nBiden said no one complained that the $700 billion in forgiven small business loans as a part of former President Donald Trump's Covid-19 relief would make inflation worse.\n\nAsked if the debt cancellation was fair to those who had already paid their loans or never took them out in the first place, Biden responded: \"Is it fair to the people who, in fact, do not own multi-million businesses and see these guys getting all the tax breaks?\"\n\nBiden has already canceled billions of dollars in student loan debt\n\nIn the meantime, Biden has taken a more targeted approach to student debt relief. Most of his efforts have been meant to expand and streamline existing federal student loan forgiveness programs.\n\nHe has also temporarily expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that forgives the debt of government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments, and made changes to the income-driven repayment plans, bringing millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness.\n\nBut the programs are complicated and don't always work the way they should. A recent Government Accountability Office report found that few people have qualified for forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan, for example. The Department of Education had approved forgiveness for a total of 157 loans as of June 1, 2021. Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Education said in its statement that the administration is \"proposing long-term changes\" to the PSLF program.\n\n\"Specifically, the Department proposed allowing more payments to qualify for PSLF including partial, lump sum, and late payments, and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances -- such as those for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps service, National Guard duty, and military service -- to count toward PSLF,\" the release states.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly", "Katie Lobosco", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/24/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-updates/7867780001/", "title": "'Debt and no degree': Biden cancels $20K in student loan debt: recap", "text": "WASHINGTON – Millions of Americans saddled by student loan debt breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday.\n\nDelivering on a key campaign promise, President Joe Biden announced he would cancel at least $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers, as well as $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients. The move comes months before the midterm elections, where Democrats are hoping to energize young voters.\n\nBiden, who made the move using executive authority, said the cost of a college education has become exorbitant.\n\n“That ticket has become too expensive for too many Americans,\" Biden said during remarks from the White House’s Roosevelt Room. \"The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you might not have the ticket that graduating college once offered.\"\n\nBiden held off making a final decision for months amid pressure from fellow Democrats, unions and other liberal groups pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 in student loan debt. His move to target $10,000 as a baseline mostly won praise from the left but also pushback from activists seeking more.\n\nBut questions remain about how the relief will impact the economy — a point that has drawn GOP attacks. Many Republicans have slammed the debt cancellation plan as an elitist ploy to help the rich and punish hard-working Americans who paid off their student loan debts.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nHow much will be forgiven? Up to $20,000 in debt relief for people who have been low-income Pell Grant recipients; $10,000 for all other borrowers with incomes less than $125,000 or from households earning $250,000 or less.\n\nUp to $20,000 in debt relief for people who have been low-income Pell Grant recipients; $10,000 for all other borrowers with incomes less than $125,000 or from households earning $250,000 or less.

Click here to share.\n\nWhy the White House won’t say how much loan forgiveness will cost\n\nWhite House officials said they could not put a price tag on the loan forgiveness program in part because they don’t know how many eligible borrowers will apply for relief.\n\n“Realistically, we're not going to get to 100%. But the question is, how far short of 100% are we going to be?” said Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council.\n\nVoices:Biden's student loan forgiveness is a good start, but it falls short for borrowers like me\n\nIn addition, the amount of money the government expects to collect on outstanding debt in the future fluctuates based on economic conditions and other factors. If a borrower was never going to repay the $10,000 that will now be forgiven, Ramamurti said, then “it's not reasonable to say that the cost of that is $10,000, because we were not realistically going to collect anywhere close to $10,000 from it.”\n\nThe administration also wants to factor in the economic benefits it says will flow from relieving debt burdens. If more people will be able to start businesses or buy a home, that creates new tax revenue which offsets the front-end costs of the program, Ramamurti said.\n\n“The bottom line here is that there's all these different factors that go into the cost,” he said. “Standing here today, I can't tell you how all of those are going to shake out.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nPreventing future tuition increases?\n\nThe Education Department will keep an eye on whether schools raise their tuition in expectation that changes to the loan program will make it easier for students to take on more debt, White House officials said.\n\n“This is something the Department of Education is aware of,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “This is something that we’re monitoring.”\n\nSusan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, said too many colleges have jacked up prices while making wild promises about how much students can earn after getting a degree. She said the Education Department will publish annually a list of institutions that are “the worst actors.”\n\nRice also emphasized that the 2021 coronavirus relief package included both state and local funding, as well as money targeted to higher education, that she said should be used “to make sure that public institutions don't increase their tuition and expenses greater than the rate of inflation.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhite House 'happy' to debate fairness of policy\n\nRice said the administration is eager to take on criticisms that loan forgiveness is unfair to some, including people who paid off their loans without help or found other ways – such as military service – to finance their education.\n\n“This is a debate we are happy to have,” she said.\n\nRice said everyone in the nation benefits when the middle and working class do well. This relief will be targeted to those who need it most, she said.\n\nPeople who paid off their loans deserve credit for doing so, she added.\n\n“That’s fantastic,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that because some were able to do so, nobody should help those who weren’t.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren lauds Biden's action\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other progressive Democrats had been pushing Biden for months to cancel up to $50,000 in debt per borrower. If she was disappointed with Biden's announcement, however, she didn’t show it.\n\n“The cancellation the president is offering is historic,” Warren said. “It will be life changing for tens of millions of people. I will keep pushing to raise the numbers, but we need to pause for a minute to recognize just how powerful the president’s announcement today is.”\n\nWarren also gave credit to Biden for limiting how much borrowers will have to pay on their loans through income-driven repayment plans. Ultimately, she said the debt cancellation is a bet on the country’s future.\n\n“This is America saying that our people, even people who don’t have a lot of money, are our best investment,” she said. “And we’re just going to keep right on investing. I love it.”\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nRepublicans attack Biden’s plan\n\nCongressional Republicans attacked President Joe Biden’s decision to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans as a giveaway to the left wing of the Democratic party.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called Biden’s plan a “debt transfer scam,” charging that Americans who have already paid their debts will be forced to foot the bill for the forgiven loans.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell described the move as a “slap in the face” to Americans who chose not to go to college or already paid their debt.\n\n“This is the one consistent thread that connects Democrats’ policies: Taking money and purchasing power away from working families and redistributing it to their favored friends.”\n\nSenator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, called the move “an insult to every American who played by the rules and worked hard to responsibly pay off their own debt.”\n\n“Once again, the Biden administration is selling out working families to appease the far-left wing of the Democrat party,” Barrasso said in a statement.\n\nThe Republican National Committee said the decision will immediately increase inflation while costing taxpayers $300 billion.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Ella Lee\n\nBiden to fight to double Pell Grant, says relief is about 'possibilities'\n\nBiden said he is going to continue to fight to double the Pell Grant. “I didn't get that done this time,” he said.\n\nHe added that his announcement on relief is “about opportunities.”\n\n“It's about giving people a fair shot,” he said. “It's about the one word America can be defined by, possibilities. It's all about providing possibilities.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nIncome-based loan repayment\n\nBiden also introduced a plan for paying back loans based on discretionary income.\n\nDiscretionary money is what's left after paying taxes and necessary cost-of-living expenses. It's different from disposable income, which is simply the amount left after paying taxes.\n\nKnowing what discretionary income is important because many federal student loan repayment plans are income-driven and have payments that are based on discretionary income.\n\n“It’s a game changer,” Biden said.\n\n– Ella Lee and Medora Lee\n\nBiden said debt relief is 'economically responsible'\n\nBiden said the relief to some student loan borrowers is “an economically responsible course.”\n\n“As we provide targeted relief, we’re taking an economically responsible course,” Biden said, pushing back on concerns of how the relief will impact inflation.\n\n“Independent experts agree that these actions taken together will provide real benefits for families without meaningful effect on inflation,” Biden said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden: ‘It’s time for the payments to resume.’\n\nBiden said the moratorium on student loan payments will be extended one last time to Dec. 31.\n\n“We’ve wound down pandemic relief programs like the ones, unemployment insurance and small businesses. It’s time we do the same thing for student loans,” Biden said. “It’s time for the payments to resume.”\n\n– Kenneth Tran\n\n'Three key factors' to Biden's student loan response\n\nBiden announced three key components of his student loan relief plan: an extension on the student loan moratorium to Dec. 31, the cancellation of $20,000 in debt for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for other borrowers and “fixing the student loan system itself.”\n\n“All this means people can finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt, to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business” Biden said. “When this happens, the whole economy is better off.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nCanceling debt is a ‘Band-Aid;' advocates want college to be more affordable\n\nSome education advocates are saying they want to see more from the Biden administration to address future student loan debt.\n\nWhile the National Parents Union, an education policy advocacy group, praised the Biden administration for taking steps to cancel student loan debt, “there is still much work to be done.”\n\n\"Canceling $10,000 in student loan debt merely puts a Band-Aid on the real problem of reforming the system that has landed us in this mess — and within years we will be right back at the same point,” they said.\n\nThe group noted that the average debt is $12,000 for a borrower who is white. However, Black women on average have more than $52,000 in debt.\n\n“While this will take some of the immediate burden away from many families, addressing those inequitable conditions, including the lack of generational wealth and additional support resources that many are forced to make up for through additional borrowing, we have not seen enough to address the underlying inequity of these systems that perpetuate economic inequality,” the group said.\n\nThe group said they want to see lawmakers make college more affordable and accessible.\n\nBraxton Brewington, spokesperson for the Debt Collective, a group that has organized demonstrations calling for total student loan debt cancellation, said today’s action was a first step worth celebrating but it fell “short of what economic and racial justice demands.”\n\n“The even better news is that Biden’s authority to cancel student debt doesn’t disappear after one executive use — he can and should simply cancel more student debt, which would boost the economy, narrow the racial wealth gap and grant real financial freedom to communities across the country for whom $20,000 or $10,000 of cancelation offers little relief,” Braxton said.\"\n\n– Rebecca Morin and Chris Quintana\n\nA tough decision:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nPell Grants at 50: Loss of buying power has Congress rethinking ways of paying for college\n\nWho will be affected?\n\nAccording to the Education Department, about 90% of those receiving relief, and who aren’t in school, make less than $75,000 a year.\n\nAmong eligible borrowers, 21% are 25 or younger and nearly half are between the ages of 26 and 39. More than a third are over 40, including 5% of whom are senior citizens.\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nMarket and corporate America eye Biden plan with caution, as inflation specter looms\n\nCorporations and the wider market have had mixed reactions to Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. Backers of the move see it as a smart way to give consumers more money to buy homes and goods. Other market watchers are concerned that investors would see negative stock portfolios if the economy shrinks in response to wiped out loan debt.\n\nIf forgiveness sparks more inflation, it could also pressure the value of the dollar. The Brookings Institution has calculated that a $10,000 reprieve would add up to a wipeout of debt larger than many social safety nets combined, including WIC, SNAP and federal school lunch plans.\n\n– Riley Gutiérrez McDermid\n\nFuture payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers could be cut in half\n\nThe Education Department is proposing to halve the monthly payments for some borrowers from 10% to 5% of discretionary income — the amount that borrowers have to pay each month on their undergraduate loans. The proposal also would raise the amount of income considered \"nondiscretionary\" — which means it's protected from being used for repaying loans.\n\nFor some types of loan repayment plans, balances would be forgiven after 10 years of payment instead of 20. And, the rule would fully cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest, so a borrower’s loan balance wouldn't grow if they are making required payments.\n\nThe department said the proposal will be published in the near future in the Federal Register and open for comments for 30 days.\n\n– Nirvi Shah\n\nEducation Department: Millions of borrowers' student loans will be forgiven automatically\n\nThe Education Department said nearly 8 million borrowers are likely to get their loan forgiven automatically because the agency already has information about their income.\n\nMore details will be coming in the next few weeks.\n\nOther borrowers will have to apply for loan forgiveness, and the applications will be available “no later” than when the freeze on student loan payments ends later this year.\n\n– Chris Quintana\n\nAn unprecedented move\n\nThe mass cancellation of student loans is unprecedented in the nation's history of student borrowing — but there has been little precedent in the student loan landscape for more than two and a half years.\n\nAt the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, then-President Donald Trump paused student loan payments, set interest rates at zero percent and stopped collection attempts on overdue debts. Both Trump and Biden extended the moratorium multiple times. The most recent extension was April 6, less than 30 days before payments had been scheduled to start in May. It was set to expire Aug. 31, with some borrowers getting notices that were later retracted about payments resuming Sep. 1.\n\nThe administration already has erased roughly $32 billion in student debt for 1.6 million borrowers by widening the eligibility requirements for pre-existing relief programs. It cleared the debt of those who attended predatory colleges and the permanently disabled. It also has canceled more than $10 billion in student debt for those working in the public sector.\n\nBiden's latest plans mean forgiving billions more in student loan debt for millions of borrowers, eclipsing the administration’s past actions. Yet millions of Americans will be left with student loan debt, especially those who pursued advanced degrees or had less financial support from their families or scholarships to pay for college.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-qualify/index.html", "title": "How to qualify for Biden's new student loan forgiveness plan | CNN ...", "text": "(CNN) President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced his plan to address student loan debt , which includes debt forgiveness for certain borrowers and extending the pandemic-related payment pause.\n\nThe Biden administration has already canceled nearly $32 billion of the $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student debt by expanding existing forgiveness programs for public-sector workers, disabled borrowers and students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges.\n\nHere are details CNN has learned of Biden's new plan, including how much will be forgiven and who is eligible.\n\nWho qualifies?\n\nThe plan applies to federal student loan borrowers.\n\nHow much forgiveness will they get?\n\nThe amount of debt canceled depends on whether the borrower received a Pell grant to attend college. A federal Pell grant is only given to undergraduate students who \"display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree\" and \"does not have to be repaid, except under certain circumstances,\" according to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office. Per data cited by the White House , Pell grants currently only cover a third of the cost of a four-year public college degree, which has led to increased borrowing.\n\nIndividual borrowers who make less than $125,000 yearly and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 yearly will have up $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven if they did not receive a Pell grant as an undergraduate student, per the FSA website\n\nIndividual borrowers who make less than $125,000 yearly and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 yearly but did receive a Pell grant as an undergraduate student will have up $20,000 of their student loan debt forgiven.\n\nWhat steps do eligible borrowers have to take?\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be able to receive debt forgiveness automatically because the Department of Education already has their income information, FSA says.\n\nThe Biden administration will launch an application in the coming weeks for borrowers to provide their income information or if borrowers are unsure if the department has their income information already. The application will be available by early October, a senior administration official told CNN. After a borrower completes the application, the individual can expect the student loan relief within four to six weeks, the official also said.\n\nTo be notified when the application is open, borrowers can sign up at studentaid.gov.\n\nFSA says the application will be available before the federal student loan repayment pause ends on December 31. Borrowers are advised to apply before November 15 in order to receive relief before the repayment pause expires, but the Department of Education will continue to process applications even after the pause expires, the official noted.\n\nBorrowers can sign up for updates on when the application is open at the Department of Education's subscriptions page\n\nHow will future repayments for remaining debt work?\n\nStudent loan repayment will be paused again until December 31, 2022, with repayments starting in January 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration is also proposing a rule to create a new income-driven repayment plan in which borrowers pay no more than 5% of their monthly income on undergraduate loans, a decrease from the current 10% threshold.\n\nThe rule would also increase the amount of income that is considered \"non-discretionary income\" so no borrower earning below 225% of the federal poverty level will have to make a monthly payment.\n\nFor borrowers with loan balances of $12,000 or less, loan balances would be forgiven after 10 years of payments instead of the current 20-year mark, under the proposed new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nAnd to help prevent a borrower's loan balance from growing while the individual makes monthly payments, under the proposed rule the Biden administration would cover unpaid monthly interest, even if the monthly payment is $0 due to the borrower's income level.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/10/06/public-service-student-loan-forgiveness-biden/6011023001/", "title": "Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Biden changes student loans ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The promise of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was supposed to be simple.\n\nIf college graduates were willing to forgo the private sector’s lucrative pay and work instead as a teacher, police officer or government worker, any federal student debt they had after 10 years of payments would be forgiven.\n\nThe program has proved anything but forgiving. More than a decade after its inception in 2007, thousands upon thousands of borrowers have applied for forgiveness. The federal government has rejected nearly all of them.\n\nThat's supposed to change, starting this fall.\n\nQuestions about loan relief?Who is eligible and how to apply under Biden’s new program\n\nThe Education Department on Wednesday announced a sweeping overhaul to the loan forgiveness program that will immediately erase the debt of 22,000 borrowers to the tune of $1.7 billion. The government estimated another 27,000 borrowers could see about $2.8 billion in debts forgiven if they prove they were employed in an eligible job.\n\nThe changes are designed to let borrowers correct errors and count payments they were trying to make toward the program. That should shorten the amount of time more than 550,000 borrowers – those who have already consolidated their loans – are required to make payments to qualify for forgiveness, the government said.\n\nThe redesign of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is President Joe Biden's latest effort to address the nation’s growing $1.7 trillion in student loan debt and ease the burden of struggling borrowers.\n\nProgressives have called on Biden to forgive up to $50,000 in loans per borrower, but the executive branch has instead rolled out targeted relief, such as for those who have been defrauded by their college or those who are permanently disabled. With the changes from the public service program, the federal government will have forgiven roughly $11.5 billion in student loan debt.\n\n\"Borrowers who devote a decade of their lives to public service should be able to rely on the promise of Public Service Loan Forgiveness,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said. \"The system has not delivered on that promise to date, but that is about to change for many borrowers who have served their communities and their country.\"\n\nThe changes come after a string of critical reports about Public Service Loan Forgiveness' inaccessibility. CBS' \"60 Minutes\" recently reported on military veterans who tried and failed to obtain forgiveness.\n\nAnd the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group, found that the loan servicer FedLoan had denied thousands of borrowers forgiveness because of minor errors or paperwork issues.\n\nSeth Frotman, the group's executive director, is a frequent critic of the Education Department's handling of student loans, especially the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But he said he's encouraged by the changes the department put forward.\n\n\"This is a good day for teachers, nurses, servicemembers and millions of workers serving on the front lines of the pandemic,\" Frotman said. \"For too long, those who give the most to our communities and our country have been given the runaround and forced to shoulder debts that should have been canceled.\"\n\nAnd two of the nation's largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, in separate statements lauded the changes and said they would benefit educators and other employees in the public sector. Both had long pushed the Education Department to fix what they described as a broken program.\n\nStringent requirements hamper relief\n\nThe trouble with Public Service Loan Forgiveness stems from the requirements for relief.\n\nBorrowers seeking forgiveness must work in a job the government deems public service, and they have to make 120 payments through the appropriate income-based repayment plan. And only borrowers with loans made by the federal government, known as direct loans, qualify for relief.\n\nTens of thousands of people thought they qualified but messed up one of those criteria – by paying on the wrong type of loan, by not enrolling in an income-based repayment plan before making payments, or by working in a job they later discovered didn't qualify for forgiveness – and found themselves out of luck.\n\nBefore the announcement, only 16,000 borrowers had seen their debt forgiven via the program, according to the Education Department. About 1.3 million people are trying to have their debts discharged through the program.\n\nChanges to the loan forgiveness program will take place in two parts. The agency will first loosen some of the rules that had prevented eligible borrowers from discharging their loans, via a limited waiver. The government, for example, will allow payments on any of a person's loans to count toward the total number required for forgiveness.\n\nThe department said it would automatically credit borrowers who already have direct loans and have proved they work in an eligible field. Others who haven't enrolled in the program or have ineligible federal loans will have to apply for forgiveness, which may require them to consolidate their loans. Borrowers will have until October 2022 to apply.\n\nThe Education Department also plans to review all Public Service Loan Forgiveness applications that had been denied and to give federal employees automatic credit toward forgiveness.\n\nOther changes will come about more slowly via regulations made by \"rule-making,\" a lengthy and complicated bureaucratic back-and-forth between the government and other stakeholders.\n\nOnly some loans qualify for forgiveness\n\nOne of the most problematic pieces of Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Many borrowers had the wrong type of loan and didn't realize they weren't eligible for relief.\n\nWhen the loan forgiveness program was first introduced, many of the loans offered from the federal government were Family Federal Education Loans, or loans made through private entities but insured by the federal government. The government stopped offering those loans in 2010, and now relies on direct loans – the kind eligible for forgiveness. The Education Department said about 60% of borrowers with an approved employer hold FFEL loans.\n\n“To a layperson, it wouldn't be very obvious that you had the wrong loan type,” said Betsy Mayotte, president of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors.\n\nAnd borrowers didn't have a choice which type of loan they received, she said. Mayotte’s nonprofit has helped thousands of borrowers with their student loan payments, and she helps moderate a subreddit focused on Public Service Loan Forgiveness. She said many of the issues she handles these days are tied to borrowers with ineligible loans.\n\nMayotte said the short-term waiver will help people, but she questioned whether borrowers who miss the waiver period might be in the same boat come Nov. 1, 2022.\n\nShe said concerned borrowers may want to consider consolidating their loans into a single direct loan if they haven't done so already.\n\nIf borrowers are unsure about what type of loan they have, Mayotte said, they can request that information from their loan servicer or they can check on the federal government's website for financial aid.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-repayment/index.html", "title": "Biden's latest student debt move will bring 3.6 million borrowers ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) The Department of Education is making more changes to the federal student loan system that will help bring millions of borrowers -- some of whom may have previously been in forbearance -- closer to receiving debt forgiveness.\n\nThese new actions, announced Tuesday, are the latest moves by the Biden administration to make it easier for federal student loan borrowers to receive forgiveness that they may already be entitled to under existing programs.\n\nBy the end of March, more than 700,000 of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers had seen their outstanding debt discharged under President Joe Biden, totaling more than $17 billion in relief. He recently extended a pandemic-related payment pause for federal student loans until August 31.\n\nTuesday's actions will bring more than 3.6 million borrowers at least three years closer to receiving forgiveness through what's known as the income-driven repayment program, or IDR. The program, which offers four types of repayment plans, allows borrowers to avoid loan default by lowering their monthly payments based on their income and family size.\n\nIDR also promises loan forgiveness after 20-25 years of payments are made. Several thousands of borrowers will immediately see forgiveness through the IDR program after Tuesday's actions are fully implemented, according to the Department of Education.\n\nAnother 40,000 borrowers will receive immediate forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program because they will get credit for more of their payments.\n\n\"Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it's certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they're eligible for,\" said US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in a statement.\n\n\"Today, the Department of Education will begin to remedy years of administrative failures that effectively denied the promise of loan forgiveness to certain borrowers enrolled in IDR plans,\" he added.\n\nIDR program and to provide borrowers with debt relief. The lawmakers' Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Dick Durbin of Illinois called on the Department of Education last week to investigate mismanagement of theIDR program and to provide borrowers with debt relief. The lawmakers' letter cited a recent report from NPR that found that very few borrowers were able to get the loan forgiveness they were promised by the IDR program.\n\nFixing past errors\n\nThe changes announced Tuesday will help federal student loan borrowers who did not get accurate information from their loan servicers about their repayment options and were steered into forbearance -- which allows for a temporary stop in payments -- when they could have been enrolled in an IDR plan.\n\nForbearance can be a quick and easy solution to help borrowers struggling to make their monthly loan payments to stay out of default. But sometimes it's better for borrowers to enroll in an IDR program instead. That way they can make a lower monthly payment while also getting credit toward forgiveness.\n\nA Department of Education review suggests that loan servicers placed borrowers into forbearance in violation of department rules, even when a borrower's monthly payment under an IDR plan could have been as low as $0.\n\nThe Department of Education will be conducting a one-time account adjustment that will count time spent in forbearances of more than 12 consecutive months or for more than 36 months cumulative toward forgiveness under IDR and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF cancels debt after 10 years for eligible public sector workers who make qualifying monthly payments.\n\nThe agency will also increase oversight of loan servicers' use of forbearance going forward.\n\nThe Department of Education has also found flaws in the way payments are tracked by both loan servicers and its own office of Federal Student Aid, suggesting borrowers are missing out on progress toward IDR forgiveness. To address past inaccuracies, the agency will conduct a one-time revision of IDR payments and reform the Federal Student Aid's tracking system.\n\nBiden's piecemeal approach to loan forgiveness\n\nBiden has resisted pressure from other Democrats to grant broad student loan forgiveness. Instead, his administration has taken several actions to make loan cancellation easier under existing programs.\n\nLast year, the administration temporarily expanded eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program until October 31, 2022. So far, the Department of Education has identified more than 113,000 borrowers with about $6.8 billion in loans who are eligible for student debt cancellation due to the waiver.\n\nThe department has also been chipping away at a backlog of forgiveness claims filed under a policy known as borrower defense to repayment that allows former students who were defrauded by their colleges to seek federal debt relief. Under that policy, the Biden administration has canceled about $2 billion in debt held by more than 105,000 individuals who attended for-profit colleges and another $1.2 billion for borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institutes before it closed.\n\nThe department also improved efforts to reach borrowers eligible for debt relief because of permanent disabilities, canceling $7.8 billion for more than 400,000 borrowers.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/biden-student-loan-forbearance-august-31/index.html", "title": "Clock is ticking for Biden to make key decisions on student loans ...", "text": "(CNN) With less than three weeks to go until the federal student loan repayment pause expires, millions of borrowers are still in the dark about whether President Joe Biden will extend the current payment moratorium or possibly forgive any of their debts.\n\nBorrower balances have effectively been frozen for more than two years, with no payments required on most federal student loans since March 2020 -- when the coronavirus pandemic sent many Americans into lockdown. During this time, interest stopped accumulating and collections on defaulted debt have been on hold.\n\nNow, as borrowers' fates hang in the balance, the President is set to spend several days on a long-awaited vacation. And the Biden administration has not sent any public signals to suggest they'll announce a student loan decision while he's away.\n\nStudent loan activists and advocates participated in a virtual meeting with White House officials earlier Thursday, according to a White House official, who said the session was held at the request of the groups.\n\nOfficials from the White House Domestic Policy Council, National Economic Council, Office of Public Engagement and Office of Political Strategy and Outreach were slated to attend. And Biden, who traveled to South Carolina to begin his vacation on Wednesday, did not participate in the meeting.\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the meeting.\n\nAs the payment pause deadline nears, Natalia Abrams, the president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center, called on the President to meet with borrowers.\n\n\"We've seen the same reports. ... The meeting states that it was with White House officials, organizations and advocates, but what we feel was missing is that we have yet to see the administration and President Biden have a meeting with borrowers themselves,\" Abrams said.\n\nBiden has already extended the pause four times and has repeatedly argued that it was necessary to allow borrowers to get back on their feet. In April -- when he last extended the repayment pause -- he said that though the economy had gained strength, the country was \"still recovering from the pandemic and the unprecedented economic disruption it caused.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and advocates have been calling on Biden to broadly cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower , but the President has said he would not consider that number.\n\nAlong with potentially extending the pause, the White House has suggested Biden is considering canceling $10,000 per borrower, excluding those who earn more than $125,000 a year.\n\n\"We haven't made a decision yet. ... The Department of Education will communicate directly with borrowers about the end of the payment pause when a decision is made,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. \"When it comes to the cancellation ... the President understands firsthand the burden that a student loan has on families ... and so we're just going to continue to assess our options for cancellation.\"\n\nJean-Pierre emphasized that Biden will have something to announce \"before August 31.\"\n\nWith only three weeks until student loan servicers are scheduled to resume collecting federal student loan payments, Biden and his team are cutting it close. Normally, loan servicers send out billing statements at least 21 days before a payment is due, but those haven't gone out yet since Biden is still making up his mind.\n\n\"For many weeks, there's been no change in the guidance from the Department of Education. Servicers have been told to hold off on sending out any communication about the resumption of payments,\" said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a nonprofit trade group whose members are responsible for servicing over 95% of all federal student loans.\n\nWhile Biden didn't announce a decision on student loans announced before he ditched Washington for the beaches of South Carolina on Wednesday, he's riding into his vacation on the headwinds of a few successful and chaotic weeks at the White House.\n\nOver the course of the last three weeks, Biden has dealt with a case of Covid-19 and a subsequent rebound, he signed into law two major bipartisan pieces of legislation, he gave the green light on the targeted killing of the man who succeeded Osama bin Laden as leader of al Qaeda, and the Senate managed to pass a slimmed down version of his landmark climate and health care bill.\n\nMeanwhile, despite concerns last month about the prospect of a recession, national unemployment numbers defied economists' expectations, gas prices have continued to go down in the last several weeks and heightened inflation eased in July . However, Americans are still paying more for everyday items like food, gas and vehicles than they're used to, leaving less room in their budgets.\n\nThe midterm elections are less than 100 days away, and CNN's latest data shows Biden's approval rating remains low.\n\nAmericans' attitudes toward student debt relief are sharply divided along partisan and generational lines.\n\nA majority of Democrats in a May CNN poll (56%) -- and an even wider majority of self-described liberals (69%) -- say the government is doing too little on student loan debt, according to the CNN poll, while only a third of Republicans and self-described conservatives alike say the same. Seventy percent of adults younger than 35 say the government is doing too little, a figure that drops to 50% among those in the 35-49 age bracket, and 35% among those age 50 or older.\n\nContinuing the forbearance or canceling debt could deliver financial relief to borrowers. But broad student loan forgiveness would also shift the cost -- likely hundreds of billions of dollars -- to taxpayers, including those who chose not to go to college or already paid for their education. Loan cancellation could also add to inflation while doing nothing to address the root of the problem: college affordability.\n\nAnd the President, so far, has failed to get most of his college affordability proposals approved by Congress. The latest iteration of his proposed social safety net bill, called the Inflation Reduction Act, was approved by the Senate this month and now heads to the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives for a vote. But the bill does not contain previously proposed provisions that would have lowered the cost of college.\n\nOutside of the payment pause and an executive action to broadly cancel student loan debt, there are several other ways many of the 43 million federal student loan borrowers may qualify for some student loan forgiveness. Targeted debt forgiveness programs already exist that help public sector workers and borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit college, for example.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/23/biden-near-decision-10-000-student-loan-cancellation/7868363001/", "title": "Biden to announce $10,000 student loan cancellation", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is set to announce Wednesday that he will forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers who fall below an income cap, according to sources familiar with the plan.\n\nAfter weighing executive action for months, the president is expected to reveal his long-awaited decision after he returns to the White House from vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The action is also expected to include extending until January a pause on federal student loan payments – implemented during the coronavirus pandemic – set to expire at the end of this month.\n\nThe latest on student loan forgiveness:Updates from Wednesday on Biden's official announcement\n\nThe president has said he would make a decision by Aug. 31. Biden faces increasing pressure from progressive Democrats to cancel an even larger share of debt for Americans who took federal loans to pay for college. But some Democratic economists, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, worry about the risk of debt cancelation exacerbating 40-year-high inflation.\n\nMore:Biden taking 'hard look' at student loan debt forgiveness, but less than $50,000\n\nWhat the president is considering\n\nThe White House has zeroed in on a plan that would cancel $10,000 in student loan debt per eligible borrower, according to sources, matching a figure Biden campaigned on. The White House has also discussed expanding relief beyond $10,000 for borrowers who meet certain criteria and Pell Grant recipients, according to one source.\n\nThe debt cancellation would be limited to borrowers with incomes of $125,000 or less and household earnings of less than $250,000, and would apply only to people with federal loans, not private ones.\n\nMore than 43 million people have federal student loan debt in the U.S., and the average borrower has about $37,000, according to data compiled by the Education Data Initiative. The outstanding federal loan balance is about $1.6 trillion.\n\nMore:Biden aides 'talking daily' about student loans, expect decision soon: Education Secretary Cardona\n\nProgressive Democrats have pushed for more\n\nCanceling $10,000 in student loan debt could receive mixed reviews from progressives groups – including the NAACP, Congressional Black Caucus and unions – that have sought greater debt forgiveness. Some liberals have urged Biden to cancel all student loan debt. Top Democrats, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., lobbied Biden to cancel at least $50,000 in student loan debt.\n\n\"If the rumors are true, we've got a problem. And tragically, we’ve experienced this so many times before,\" said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, which has pushed for a minimum student debt cancelation of $50,000.\n\n\n\nThe income cap for eligibility – designed to prevent wealthy Americans from benefiting – is another area of contention for progressive activists, who say it would create a bureaucratic mess and prevent millions of borrowers from getting relief.\n\n\"The hoops of means testing means that millions and millions of borrowers won’t get help,\" said Melissa Bryne, executive director of We The 45 Million, which represents student loan borrowers advocating for student debt cancelation. She called it \"an outrageous violation\" of Biden's campaign pledge to cancel student loan debt to all borrowers.\n\nInflation risk hangs over decision\n\nBiden said in April that he was taking a \"hard look\" at executive action to forgive federal student loan debt. Chief among the White House's considerations in the months that followed: the possible impact on inflation that has soared throughout the year.\n\nCanceling potentially up to $10,000 in student loan debt would mean billions more collectively staying in the pockets of Americans. Some critics argue the extra money for consumers to spend risks stoking demand and further accelerating historic inflation.\n\nMore:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nSummers, former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and economic adviser to Barack Obama, has led the warnings about the impact on inflation and said canceling student debt would disproportionately help higher-earning Americans. Jason Furman, Obama's chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has raised similar concerns.\n\n\"Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation,\" Summers said in a tweet Monday. \"It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.\"\n\nThe impact for borrowers\n\nA study from Liberty Street Economics found forgiving $10,000 per borrower would wipe $321 billion in student loan debt, and it would completely erase the debt for about a third of borrowers, or roughly 12 million people.\n\nA separate study this week from the The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania found that forgiving $10,000 in federal college student loan debt will cost the federal government between $300 billion and $980 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe Biden administration has already has erased roughly $32 billion in student debt for 1.6 million borrowers by widening the eligibility requirements for pre-existing relief programs, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nMore:Young people want student debt relief. But not all want it totally canceled, poll finds\n\nA boost for Democrats in the midterms?\n\nCanceling some student loan debt – an idea wildly popular among young voters who lean to the left – could energize a key voting bloc that has shown signs of being unenthused in the November midterm elections.\n\nA USA TODAY/Public Agenda poll in July found that nearly 60% of Americans support “forgiving a significant portion of government student loans for college graduates who have excessive debt.” That rate of support dropped when Americans were asked about forgiving debt for all graduates, regardless of income.\n\nOpinion:'Forgiving' student loans isn't motivated by kindness. It's all about cold, hard politics.\n\nPreviewing their line of attack, Republicans have slammed student debt cancelation as a ploy to reward the liberal, college-going elite and punish those who couldn't afford college or had to save to pay off their debt. They also said it would spike inflation.\n\n\"Joe Biden has had a lot of bad ideas,\" Sen.

Now, the government is trying to make it right.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Education announced sweeping changes to its Public Service Loan Forgiveness program after thousands of borrowers applied for forgiveness, with nearly all of them being rejected by the federal government.\n\nAfter making a decade of payments, many found out that they had the wrong type of federal loan or repayment plan to be eligible for the program. Thousands have been straddled with debt that they thought would be erased.\n\n►Student loan forgiveness:Half a million people to benefit from overhaul, some immediately\n\n►Millennials quit jobs to day trade:Here's the risk, reward.\n\nUnder temporary changes through October 2022, those borrowers will be eligible to get their loans cleared.\n\nThe overhaul is also designed to let borrowers correct errors and count payments they were trying to make toward the program. It is expected to shorten the amount of time more than 550,000 borrowers – those who have already consolidated their loans – are required to make payments to qualify for forgiveness, the government said.\n\nThe changes will immediately erase the debt of 22,000 borrowers to the tune of $1.7 billion, the agency said. The government estimated another 27,000 borrowers could see about $2.8 billion in debts forgiven if they prove they were employed in an eligible job.\n\nIf you have these loans, here are the steps you can take to get relief:\n\nWhat is Public Service Loan Forgiveness? How did it originate?\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness is a program that was launched in 2007 in an effort to steer more college graduates into public service. As long as they made 10 years of payments on their federal student loans, the program promised to erase the remainder.\n\nThe program, however, has proved anything but forgiving. Before Wednesday’s announcement, only 16,000 borrowers had seen their debt forgiven via the program, according to the Education Department. About 1.3 million people are trying to have their debts discharged through the program.\n\nOne of the most problematic pieces of Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Many borrowers had the wrong type of loan and didn't realize they weren't eligible for relief.\n\nWhen the loan forgiveness program was first introduced, many of the loans offered from the federal government were Family Federal Education Loans (FFEL), or loans made through private entities but insured by the federal government.\n\nThe government stopped offering those loans in 2010 and now relies on direct loans – the kind eligible for forgiveness. The Education Department said about 60% of borrowers with an approved employer hold FFEL loans.\n\nWho is eligible for student loan forgiveness?\n\nThe government previously restricted eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to only certain types of federal student loans and specific repayment plans.\n\nHowever, through October 2022, borrowers who have made 10 years worth of payments while in a qualifying job – such as positions in federal, state or local governments, a nonprofit organization or the U.S. military – will now be eligible for loan relief no matter what kind of federal loan or repayment plan they have.\n\nPast loan payments that were previously ineligible will now count, moving some borrowers closer to forgiveness. That is expected to especially help those borrowers with Federal Family Education Loans.\n\nAmong other changes, the department will allow military members to count time on active duty toward the 10 years, even if they put a pause on making their payments during that time.\n\nHow do I figure out if my past or current employer qualifies for PSLF?\n\nUse this help tool of the Federal Student Aid website to check if you work for a qualifying employer: https://studentaid.gov/pslf/\n\nIt provides information on which employers meet requirements for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nHow do I check which federal loans I have?\n\nIf borrowers are unsure about what type of loan they have, they can request that information from their loan servicer or they can check on the federal government's website for financial aid, according to Betsy Mayotte, president of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors.\n\nIf you don't know what kind of federal loans you have, you can see which loans by logging into your account on StudentAid.gov, going to the My Aid page and scrolling down to the Loan Breakdown section.\n\nIf I qualify, what steps do I need to take?\n\nChanges to the loan forgiveness program will take place in two parts.\n\nThe agency will first loosen some of the rules that had prevented eligible borrowers from discharging their loans, via a limited waiver. The government, for example, will allow payments on any of a person's loans to count toward the total number required for forgiveness.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness waiver will be available to borrowers who have direct loans, Federal Family Education Loans and Perkins Loans.\n\nParent PLUS loans are not eligible under the limited waiver.\n\nThe department said it would automatically credit borrowers who already have direct loans and have proved they work in an eligible field. Others who haven't enrolled in the program or have ineligible federal loans will have to apply for forgiveness, which may require them to consolidate their loans. Borrowers will have until October 2022 to apply.\n\nTo find out more about loan consolidation, visit StudentAid.gov/Manage-Loans/Consolidation.\n\nThe Education Department also plans to review all Public Service Loan Forgiveness applications that had been denied and to give federal employees automatic credit toward forgiveness.\n\nOther changes will come about more slowly via regulations made by \"rule-making,\" a lengthy and complicated bureaucratic back-and-forth between the government and other stakeholders.\n\nFor more information, visit StudentAid.gov/PSLFWaiver.\n\nHow do you receive credit for past payments under the new rules?\n\nFor a limited time, borrowers may get credit for past payments made on loans that would otherwise not qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nThere are two requirements to receive additional qualifying payments: Full-time employment and loan consolidation.\n\nFor instance, you must have worked full-time for a qualifying employer when prior payments were made, according to Federal Student Aid.\n\nSome part-time workers may qualify under certain circumstances. Say you were employed in more than one qualifying part-time job at the same time. You would be considered full-time if you worked a combined average of at least 30 hours per week.\n\nIt may take several months for a borrower's account information to reflect the new payment count, according to Federal Student Aid.\n\nHow far back can I get credit for payments?\n\nTo be sure, you can only receive credit for payments made after Oct. 1, 2007, since that is when the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program began.\n\nFor any period you may receive additional qualifying payments, you must file an application.\n\nWho may need to consolidate their loans?\n\nIf you have Federal Family Education Loan Program loans, Federal Perkins Loans or other types of federal student loans that aren’t direct loans, you must consolidate them into the direct loan program by Oct. 31, 2022, according to Federal Student Aid.\n\nThis is important for borrowers because you can't receive credit for payments if you consolidate after that date. Once the consolidation process is complete, you must then submit a PSLF form to your loan servicer.\n\nThe help tool on the Federal Student Aid website will be updated in the coming months to process applications for borrowers in the Federal Family Education Loan Program and those with Perkins loans.\n\nRight now, employment can still be verified for them in Step 1 of the help tool, and loan consolidation can still be requested, Federal Student Aid said on its website. But an application for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program through the tool may not be available in the near term for those borrowers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2022/08/24/bidens-student-debt-forgiveness-what-to-know/7876380001/", "title": "Qualify for student loan forgiveness? Explaining Biden's new debt plan", "text": "President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday what many have anticipated for months – a plan to forgive or reduce student loan debt for millions of debt-saddled borrowers.\n\nIf you earn less than $125,000 annually, he said, you're eligible to receive cancellation of up to $10,000 in federal student loans. If you received a Pell Grant, you can get up to $20,000 forgiven.\n\nIf you're not eligible for any student debt forgiveness, your pause on repayments continues to be paused until year end. The Department of Education is also working on a proposal introducing a new repayment plan to ease the burden on borrowers.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic in 2020, borrowers haven't had to pay a cent on their federal student loans. During this time, the pressure grew for the president to cancel the debt. It was one of the platforms Biden ran on for president in 2020.\n\nThough the plan was welcomed by many, it still garnered criticism. Many had sought higher forgiveness amounts – $50,000 or even all amounts, no matter how large. The total outstanding balance for federally owned (including defaulted) student loans in December 2021 was $1.38 trillion, the New York Federal Reserve said in April.\n\nBIDEN PLAN RECAP:$20K in student debt to be forgiven, extend payment pause\n\nSTUDENT LOANS:Why are some people angry about Biden loan program?\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nThe application will be available mid-October, officials said. Borrowers who provide an email address at studentaid.gov are to receive an email notification when the application is available. Applications can take four to six weeks to process. The pause on federal student loan repayments terminates Dec. 31.\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be automatically eligible to receive relief because relevant income data is already available to the Department of Education.\n\nWhat’s Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan?\n\nIndividuals with an annual income of less than $125,000 (or under $250,000 for married couples or heads of households) are entitled to have up to $10,000 in federal student loans canceled. No private loans will be forgiven.\n\nThose who received a Pell Grant in college will be eligible for up to $20,000 in debt cancellation.\n\nFor those who still have student debt, the repayment pause since March 2020 will be extended to the end of the year. Borrowers will resume payments in January.\n\nBIDEN COLLEGE CAREER:Biden mentions own education in loan relief speech\n\nLIFE OFF PAUSE:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nWhat is a Pell Grant?\n\nFederal funding that’s usually awarded only to students who display exceptional financial need and have not earned a bachelor's, graduate or professional degree. Sometimes, a student enrolled in a post-baccalaureate teacher certification program might receive a Pell Grant.\n\nUnlike a loan, a Pell Grant does not have to be repaid, except under certain circumstances. Those include a change in enrollment status or if you received outside scholarships or grants that reduced your need for federal student aid.\n\nPELL GRANTS:Who qualifies? What to know from Biden student loan plan\n\nAre current students eligible for loan forgiveness?\n\nLoans awarded to current students and graduates with undergraduate, graduate and Parent PLUS loans are eligible, so long as the loans were awarded by June 30, 2022.\n\nWhat's the cost of student loan forgiveness?\n\nA one-time maximum debt forgiveness of $10,000 per borrower will cost the U.S. government around $300 billion for borrowers with incomes less than $125,000, according to analysis published on Tuesday by Junlei Chen and Kent Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model, based at the University of Pennsylvania. This cost increases to $330 billion if the program continues over the standard 10-year budget window.\n\nBefore the announcement, the Government Accountability Office estimated that alone, the payment pause since the start of the pandemic cost the government $102 billion. That amount included suspending all payments due, interest accrual and involuntary collections for loans in default from March 13, 2020, to Aug. 31, 2022.\n\nWho benefits most from the student debt forgiveness plan?\n\nMostly higher-income households. Between 69% and 73% of the debt forgiven accrues to households in the top 60% of the income distribution, Chen and Smetters said.\n\nA New York Federal Reserve study in April, though, said that the income cap to the forgiveness \"substantially reduces the cost of student loan forgiveness and increases the share of benefit going to borrowers who are more likely to struggle repaying their debts.\"\n\nFor example, an income cap of $75,000 for a $10,000 cancellation raises the share of forgiven loan dollars going to borrowers in low-income neighborhoods to 35% from 25% and the share going to lower credit score borrowers to 42% from 37%, it said.\n\nIncome caps also increase the share of loans forgiven that were delinquent before the pandemic to 60% from 34%.\n\nLIFE'S NOT FAIR:Is student loan forgiveness fair to those without college degrees? Americans remain divided over costs\n\nAVOIDING STUDENT DEBT:Middle class, minus debt: Apprenticeships, certificates offer low-cost option to college\n\nHow many Americans have student loans outstanding?\n\nAbout 45 million Americans hold federal student loan debt, according to federal data. The loan forgiveness plan should provide relief to about 43 million borrowers and cancel the full remaining balance for nearly 45% of those borrowers.\n\nThe total outstanding balance for federally owned (including defaulted) student loans in December 2021 was $1.38 trillion, the New York Federal Reserve said in April.\n\nMost (67%) student loan borrowers are under 40 years old, but 57% of all balances are owed by those under 40. That means those with larger balances are more likely to be older or to have taken out loans for graduate school, it said.\n\nThe White House estimates that its initiative will cancel the full remaining balance for roughly 20 million borrowers.\n\nWhat’s the average outstanding student loan debt amount?\n\nThe average federal student loan debt balance is $37,667 while the total average balance (including private loan debt) may be as high as $40,274, according to Education Data Initiative, which collects data and statistics about the U.S. education system.\n\nDISSECTING STUDENT LOANS:Free college or federal student loans? These alternatives could help solve student debt crisis\n\nPOLITICAL FORGIVENESS:'Forgiving' student loans isn't motivated by kindness. It's all about cold, hard politics.\n\nIs student loan forgiveness taxable?\n\nThe debt relief isn’t counted as taxable income for federal income tax purposes, the White House says.\n\nWould canceling student loan debt increase inflation?\n\nSome prominent economists, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, who was chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, have been vocal critics, saying student debt forgiveness would stoke 40-year high inflation and may be unfair.\n\n“Student loan relief is not free,” Furman tweeted on Aug. 19. “Part of it would be paid for by the 87% of Americans who do not benefit but lose out from inflation. Part of it would be paid for by future spending cuts & tax increases—with uncertainty about who will bear those costs.”\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Biden’s plan “would more than undo the deflationary pressures from the Inflation Reduction Act and add 0.15 percentage points of additional inflation in the near-term,” noted Sarah Foster, Bankrate analyst.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been on an aggressive rate-raising cycle to cool demand, but giving people spending money could stymie that effort.\n\nAnd those economists aren't the only ones worried. Hit already by hefty inflation, 59% of Americans are concerned student loan forgiveness will make inflation worse, according to a CNBC survey, conducted online by Momentive among a national sample of 5,142 adults from Aug. 4 to 15.\n\nEVERYDAY GETS EXPENSIVE:These everyday items saw the biggest price increases from inflation in July, CPI report shows\n\nJOB WORRIES:With 80% of workers afraid of losing jobs during a recession, business owners trim costs\n\nWhat is discretionary income?\n\nThe money you have left after paying taxes and necessary cost-of-living expenses. It's different from disposable income, which is simply the amount of money you have left after paying taxes.\n\nKnowing what discretionary income is is important because many federal student loan repayment plans are income-driven and have payments that are based on your discretionary income.\n\nDISCRETIONARY INCOME:What is it? Why it matters in student loan repayment.\n\nIf you qualify for student debt forgiveness, what should you do with any extra money?\n\n“Student loan forgiveness will likely decrease your monthly payment or get rid of it entirely,” said Dan Casey of Bridgeriver Advisors in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.\n\nTake that freed up money to pay off high-interest debt like credit cards, build up your emergency fund, or invest it in your retirement. Even though today looks brighter, the economy is still on shaky footing.\n\nSHAKY GROUND:Are we in a recession? America's economy stinks no matter what you call it.\n\nINFLATION HELP?:President Biden signs Inflation Reduction Act into law to address climate and health care\n\nDoes Congress need to approve Biden's loan forgiveness plan?\n\nThe White House says it is using the authority Congress granted the Department of Education to forgive the outstanding federal student loans.\n\nShould I stop paying my student loans now?\n\nThe Biden administration has extended the Student Loan Payment Pause through Dec. 31, which allows borrowers to suspend their loan payments with a 0% interest rate. The White House has warned that this will be the final extension.\n\n\"It’s time for the payments to resume,\" Biden said Wednesday.\n\nBorrowers who qualify for the payment pause and loan forgiveness should stop paying off loans if they owe less than the $10,000 cap (or $20,000 cap, for Pell Grant recipients) to take full advantage of the loan forgiveness program.\n\nOthers who earn more than $125,000 (or $250,000, for married couples) or have more than $10,000 in loans (or $20,000, for Pell Grant recipients) should be ready to start making loan payments again.\n\n\"We recommend to continue making payments for now if you can afford to because these payments go 100% toward principal until January,\" said Isabel Barrow, director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"While it’s impossible to know what will happen in the future, such as another forgiveness program, we would not recommend delaying or stopping loan payments in anticipation of future changes.\"\n\nThere is also subset of borrowers who did not have their loans paused. These borrowers should continue to make loan payments \"to keep the loan in good standing,\" according to Ameriprise financial private wealth advisor Rebecca Hall.\n\nLoans not eligible for the COVID-19 payment pause include:\n\nNondefaulted Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans not held by the Department of Education\n\nDefaulted and Nondefaulted federal Perkins loans not held by the Department of Education\n\nNondefaulted Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) loans\n\nPrivate student loans\n\nThe Department of Education administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether any of these loans would be eligible for the loan forgiveness program.\n\nCAN'T AFFORD IT:Is college worth it? Americans say they value higher education, but it's too expensive for many\n\nI paid off student loans recently. Am I eligible for a refund?\n\nThe federal government first announced the student loan payment pause on March 13, 2020. The U.S. Department of Education says borrowers who made payments during the pause – including auto-debit payments – can request a refund with their loan servicer.\n\nBorrowers can look up their loan servicer on the agency’s website.\n\nIf you don’t qualify, should you start repaying in January?\n\n“If you haven’t made a student loan payment since the pause began, it’s important to understand how much you’ll owe each month,” Daniel Milan, advisor at Cornerstone Financial Services, said.\n\nThen, review the interest rates on your loans and start paying off the highest interest ones first, enrolling in autopay so you don’t miss any payments while you get back into the habit of paying regularly and consider refinancing if it lowers your payments.\n\n“Moving multiple loans into one loan can also help you keep better track of how much you actually owe,” he said.\n\nSTOKING INFLATION?:How soaring inflation is complicating Biden's decision whether to forgive student loan debt\n\nWhat’s ahead for future borrowers?\n\nTo “substantially” reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers and protect more income from loan payments, the Department of Education is proposing a new income-driven repayment plan.\n\nHere are some things being proposed:\n\nCutting the amount borrowers have to repay each month and curbing interest so a balance won't grow so long as borrowers make their required monthly payments.​​​\n\n\n\nLoan balance forgiveness after 10 years, instead of 20, under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less. This will allow nearly all community college borrowers to be debt-free within 10 years, the White House said.\n\n\n\nStarting next summer, the Department of Education can automatically pull borrower’s income information each year, avoiding the hassle of needing to recertify their income annually and make it easier for borrowers to stay enrolled.\n\n\n\nPublic servants will also have an easier time claiming credits for time of service to go toward debt relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The Department of Education has already made some temporary changes toward that end. To apply for forgiveness or payments to count toward forgiveness under the temporary changes, visit the PSLF Help Tool.\n\nA full list of proposed regulations will be published in the coming days on the Federal Register, and the public is invited to comment on the draft rule for 30 days.\n\nTRUE COST OF COLLEGE:It's not just tuition and fees: College students are facing increasingly high rent prices, too\n\nLIFE OFF PAUSE:How the student loan payment pause changed people’s lives\n\nWould Parents PLUS loans be forgiven?\n\nParent PLUS loans are federal student loans issued directly to parents with dependents in school, meant to supplement school, state and other federal financial aid offered for a dependent undergraduate student enrolled at least half-time.\n\nParent PLUS loans held by the Department of Education are included in the cancellation policy, along with federal graduate and undergraduate loans.\n\nWhat’s being done to keep the cost of college from spiraling?\n\nThe Department of Education will publish an annual watch list of programs with the worst debt levels in the country, so students registering for the next academic year can steer clear of programs with poor outcomes. It will also request plans from colleges with the most concerning debt outcomes on how they intend to lower debt levels.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

But they rebounded after shutdowns lifted, and have roared back to set monthly records for much of the year.\n\nLast month, sales in both the Central Texas region and within Austin's city limits hit an all-time high for a November, indicating no sign of a typical season slowdown heading into the new year, according to new data from the Austin Board of Realtors.\n\nThroughout Central Texas, the supply of housing dropped to an all-time low, dipping below a one-month supply, meaning it would take just a month to deplete the supply of available homes at the current sales pace. Housing experts consider a supply of 6.5 months a market where supply and demand are in balance, with neither buyers or sellers having the upper hand.\n\nLast month, active listings dropped 55.2% to 2,842 listings and pending sales increased 23.9%, with 3,269 sales in the pipeline to close, the board said.\n\nThe region's continued low inventory -- coupled with strong demand -- has helped drive the region's sharply escalating home prices during the past decade, experts say.\n\n“Housing demand has only increased over the past several months... Our main challenge in this market is navigating the critically low levels of inventory. This near-zero level of housing inventory throughout the region is staggering, and it will put enormous pressure on home prices and the rental market,\" Romeo Manzanilla, president of the Austin Board of Realtors, said in a written statement.\n\nSales across the region were up 23.8% over November 2019, with 3,397 homes changing hands, the board said. Half of those homes sold for less than $365,000 and half sold for more, for a 19.7% increase in the median price. In November 2019, the median sales price was $305,000.\n\nWithin Austin's city limits, 1,105 homes were sold, a 28.2% increase over November 2019. The median sales price was $433,493, 10.1% higher than November 2019.\n\nLast year was the ninth year in a row in which both the number of home sales and the median price exceeded the previous year's highs, according to the board's figures. Through November, the area is on pace for another record year, as 36,529 houses have been sold in the Austin region, a 7% increase over the same period last year, the board's figures show.\n\n“With a steady influx of job creation in the pipeline, the housing market will continue to post strong numbers well into 2021,” said local housing market expert Mark Sprague, state director of information capital at Independence Title in Austin. “But, because Austin’s housing market is not slowing down, we will continue to see demand outpace the inventory available. This growth is not sustainable. The one variable that will hold the market back is the lack of inventory.”\n\nGrowth in the tech sector is a primary driver of jobs in the region. Companies including Google, Indeed and Facebook have new high-rise office towers under construction. Tesla is building a $1.1 billion plant off Texas 130 in East Austin that will manufacture And on Friday, Oracle, which is expanding its existing Lady Bird Lake waterfront campus just east of downtown Austin, announced it is moving its headquarters to Austin from California.\n\nWendi Slaton Anderson, principal broker with Roots Residential Group at Compass, said Austin attracts a diverse demographic.\n\n\"I am currently working with buyers from New York Chicago, California and Seattle,\" she said. \"I expect an additional influx of California buyers relocating to Austin with the recent announcement that the Oracle headquarters are heading our way.\"\n\nAnderson said the imbalance between the available inventory \"and the inordinate demand continues to put upward pressure on housing prices.\"\n\n\"Sheltering in place has likely created a lasting shift in buyers preferences, making it more challenging to meet their needs in the coming months,\" she said.\n\nAustin real estate broker Brad Pauly said the coronavirus pandemic \"has created the urgency of people who have been living in condos and apartments that more space is essential.\"\n\n\" A home office, a backyard, a private pool, these have been the most crucial needs for buyers,\" said Pauly, owner of Pauly Presley Realty.\n\nPauly, who has been working in the Austin real estate market for 21 years, said he's \"never seen the market this hot.\"\n\n\"Many new home builders don't have inventory to sell to buyers right now,\" Pauly said. \"Some buyers have started a lottery system just to give people the opportunity to buy.\"\n\nIn a recent report, Zillow said that nationwide, \"high demand continues to power the housing market into winter, and year-over-year list price growth is reaching new heights. Although the pace of houses going under contract is slowing, homes are selling much faster than last year at this time, and inventory continued its long contraction.\"\n\nZillow said the pandemic caused an \"unprecedented shift\" in the housing market. The rise of remote work opened up new housing options, sky-high demand drove the for-sale market to record highs, and technology changed the way people shopped for, bought, sold, rented and financed homes.\n\nIn the Austin region, list prices – after cooling in 2019 – soared in 2020, rising by more than $90,000 over the course of the year, Zillow said. Austin leads the nation in median list price growth, up 23.1% year over year to $446,642 in the week ending Dec. 5.\n\nDemand was still strong late in the year, with the median time on market dropping down to six or seven days every week from early October into November.\n\nAvailable housing inventory dropped compared to 2019 every week starting in early June, ending up falling 40.9% below last year’s figures the week ending Dec. 5.\n\nManzanilla said that, despite the local housing market's rapid recovery, \"last month's numbers should give us all pause.\"\n\n“Central Texans who could not find a property within Austin’s city limits have historically been able to expand their searches outward to find a home,\" Manzanilla said. \"But, when the entire region has virtually zero inventory, its leaders must think about how such a broad lack of housing will ultimately impact Austin’s suitability as a destination for businesses and economic growth.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/agriculture/2021/12/14/iowa-farmland-value-increase-iowa-state-university-report-acre-prices-2021/6496341001/", "title": "Iowa's average farmland values rise to an 80-year high, an Iowa ...", "text": "Driven by strong yields and high corn and soybean prices, Iowa farmland values skyrocketed 29% this year, averaging $9,751 an acre, the highest in 80 years before adjusting for inflation, a new Iowa State University survey shows.\n\nThat's 12% higher than the previous peak in 2013, at $8,716 an acre, ISU reported.\n\nWhen adjusted for inflation, this year's farmland average fell below 2012 and 2013 values, but \"this is still very, very significant,\" Wendong Zhang, an ISU associate professor of economics, said in a webinar Tuesday.\n\nThe last time Iowa's farmland values increased more than 25% was in 2011, when they rose 32.5%.\n\n\"Every day, it seems like we’re setting new highs,\" said Andrew Zellmer, a Peoples Co. farmland broker and president of the Iowa Chapter of the Realtors Land Institute, a group of brokers, appraisers and farm managers.\n\n\"There's a hunger for real assets,\" a movement Iowans can see in the residential housing market, as well, Zellmer said.\n\nZillow shows a 17% increase in Iowa home values over the past year, Zhang said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a farmland auction in northwest Iowa set a record for Sioux County, with 20 acres selling for $25,100 an acre, just shy of the $26,000 state record set near Cedar Rapids in October. The price on the Cedar Rapids land may have been boosted because it lies in the path of potential development, brokers have said.\n\nThe remaining 220 acres in the Sioux County sale drew $20,100 to $24,300 an acre.\n\n\"Northwest Iowa has been hitting $20,000 an acre-plus for several weeks in a row,\" said Jim Rothermich, vice president of Iowa Appraisal and Research Corp. in Des Moines. \"Today blew past all those auctions. Incredible market conditions.\"\n\nThe strong increases are due to good commodity prices, higher exports, better-than- expected crop yields and low interest rates, Zhang said. Corn prices for Iowa are 60% higher than a year ago, he said, and soybean prices are 32% higher.\n\nU.S. farm income is expected to grow to $116.8 billion by the end of 2021, the highest level since 2013. The higher crop and livestock receipts are expected to offset a decrease in government payments that helped farmers weather trade wars and COVID-19 supply-chain disruptions.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said this month that it expects direct farm payments this year to total $27.2 billion, down 40% from a record $45.7 billion in 2020.\n\nZhang said all 99 Iowa counties showed a record nominal value. In 20 counties, the prices were all-time highs even after adjusting for inflation, he said.\n\nMORE: Competition is fierce for Iowa's used farm equipment, attracting bidders from across the world\n\nWhile lucrative for sellers, spiking farmland prices mean farmers who rent cropland can expect to see at least a 10% hike in costs in 2022, Zhang said.\n\nFarmers have been slammed with across-the-board price increases. A Purdue University survey in November shows 43% of farmers expect input prices to rise by more than 16% in the coming year.\n\nFarmers can expect just about everything they need to grow next year's crop — from fertilizer to seed to chemicals — to cost more, said Chad Hart, an ISU agricultural economist.\n\n\"My expectation is that we’ll see much higher costs in 2022,\" Hart said.\n\nLand values also are likely to continue to rise, Zhang said. Farmland brokers, appraisers and other professionals surveyed by ISU concurred.\n\nRoughly 70% of this year's buyers were new or existing farmers, with investors making up nearly 30% of the market.\n\nZellmer said the state has had a record number of farmland sales this year, with land owners trying to cash in on high prices as well as being concerned about possible changes in tax laws that would leave them with a big bill.\n\nSales could be slimmer in the first half of 2022, Zellmer said, but the reduced supplies would support continued higher prices.\n\nWhile farmers might be concerned about a return of the 1980s farm crisis, which followed rapidly increasing land prices, Hart said history shows that's unlikely.\n\nAfter the farmland spike that occurred from 2011 to 2013, Iowa's values declined very little in the years that followed, though farm income dropped. The largest decline happened in 2014, when values fell nearly 9% from their peak.\n\n\"When you think back to the late '70s and early '80s, land values were increasing, but farm income was actually declining,\" Hart said. \"This time, we have land values and farm income moving in the same direction.\"\n\nISU said Scott County, home of Davenport, reported the highest average value for the ninth consecutive year, rising 30% to $13,852 an acre. Decatur County, on the Missouri border, had the lowest value — though it was up sharply, rising 31.5% to $5,062 an acre.\n\nClayton and Allamakee counties in Iowa's northeast corner reported the largest percentage increase, 36.4%, while Scott County saw the largest dollar increase at $3,193 per acre, ISU reported.\n\nThe smallest percentage increase, 23.2%, was in Keokuk County, in southeast Iowa, while Taylor County, in southwest Iowa, saw the smallest dollar increase, $1,199 per acre.\n\nDonnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

This included residential and commercial uses, from small installations on private rooftops to large solar farms, the group said.\n\nFor companies in the renewable energy industry, that has created a major rush in sales — and an additional strain on supply chains.\n\nDemand for solar power was already on the rise in Europe's biggest economy, as energy prices surged, policy incentives were introduced and adoption of the technology became more mainstream. But more recently, consumers have also faced ever higher utility bills scorching temperatures , and renewed anxiety over whether they'll be able to keep the heat on this winter.\n\nSince it invaded Ukraine six months ago, Russia has sharply reduced its supply of gas to Germany and other EU countries. Just last week it announced an unscheduled closure of its Nord Stream 1 pipeline later this month for maintenance, sending spot natural gas prices to a new record high\n\nFor many households, the biggest fear is that Russia will turn off the tap completely this winter. The German government has already set in motion a crisis management plan that could see rationing to businesses if that happens.\n\n\"This [demand] has only gotten stronger with the war against Ukraine, which is happening on our doorstep,\" David Wedepohl, managing director of the German Solar Association told CNN Business.\n\n\"This is something that's very much on people's minds.\"\n\nGerman officials have responded to the crisis by calling on consumers to save energy. Some municipalities have already reacted by pulling back on basic needs such as lights, showers and heating\n\nJim Gordon, the CEO of Smartflower, said the geopolitical turmoil had also pushed more people to make the switch to solar. The company provides sunflower-shaped solar power devices to corporate campuses, universities and homes.\n\n\"Our business is booming because there's a perfect storm of elements converging that are really lifting solar energy,\" Gordon told CNN Business.\n\n\"People are concerned about energy security,\" he said. \"An autocratic dictator can turn the valve on a gas pipeline and shut off energy, but nobody can control the sun.\"\n\nSoaring sales\n\nSchneider Electric SBGSF , a European industrial and energy giant, says demand for its solar-powered heating systems in Germany have \"almost doubled\" so far this year compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nThe company's sustainability arm, which advises businesses on clean energy procurement, has also reached \"an all-time peak\" in consultancy requests, according to Konstantin Elstermann, the firm's vice president of home and distribution.\n\nSimilarly, Sonnen, a German solar battery provider, has seen its orders \"more than double in comparison to last year,\" because of an \"increased desire for [people] running their homes with renewable energy,\" said CEO Oliver Koch.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Koch said his team had noted \"an additional uptick in demand since the end of February,\" when the war began, and was \"continuously expanding our production capacity to keep pace with demand.\"\n\nDemand is so high, Smartflower is now expecting to quadruple its sales in Germany this year, according to managing director Robert Sawyer.\n\n\"We've done more business in the first six months of 2022 in Germany than we did in all of 2021,\" Sawyer said, adding that sales in the country had doubled so far this year.\n\nA Smartflower installation. The maker of the solar power system says it has doubled its business in Germany so far this year, citing higher demand after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSupply chain hurdles\n\nSuch booms don't come without challenges, however.\n\nThe industry is currently facing severe labor shortages, said Elstermann from Schneider Electric.\n\n\"Some electricians are booked up three to six months in advance,\" he told CNN Business.\n\nAn autocratic dictator can turn the valve on a gas pipeline and shut off energy, but nobody can control the sun. Smartflower CEO Jim Gordon\n\n\"This bottleneck almost surpasses the current shortage of raw materials and production capacity. We know that the supply problems due to the pandemic are temporary, but the shortage of skilled workers remains,\" Elstermann said.\n\nWedepohl said the industry was racing to address the problem. Many electricians who left their jobs over the past decade have been \"reentering\" the market, while roofers are also being called on to help with installations, he added.\n\n\"A lot of installers are out there putting out extra shifts, training people, bringing new people on,\" he said. \"It is a challenge, but it is definitely a moment that we hope we can rise to.\"\n\nThe sustainability question\n\nFor now, Germany has resorted to firing up its coal power plants to reduce its gas consumption — and ensure the country keeps the lights on.\n\nBut Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made it clear the government isn't happy about it.\n\n\"It is bitter that we now have to temporarily use some power plants that we had already shut down because of Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine. But it's only for a little while,\" he said in a message last month.\n\nSimilar conversations are taking place across Europe.\n\nThis year, the United Kingdom also announced a push for other power sources, including wind and nuclear energy. And for some consumers, alternatives to gas heating, such as wood-burning fireplaces, have become more popular.\n\nThis month, Austrian climate minister Leonore Gewessler called for more green energy projects to help the country wean itself off Russian gas.\n\n\"We need to get ourselves off this dependence — cubic meter per cubic meter, windmill per windmill, PV installation per PV installation,\" she told CNN's Sara Sidner , referring to the units used in building solar and wind energy capacity.\n\n\"Because we see that our dependency on fossil fuels is used as a weapon in a war,\" Gewessler said.\n\n\"Winter is coming,\" said Wedepohl, noting that most homes in Germany were heated with gas. \"Europeans ... are also in this pretty collectively.\"\n\n— CNN's Chris Liakos and AJ Davis contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh", "Cnn Business", "Smartflower Ceo Jim Gordon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/business/nightcap-housing-market-europe-gas/index.html", "title": "The US housing market just entered an awkward phase - CNN", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nAll right, Jay Powell, part of your plan seems to be working: Fewer people are buying homes. But that's not translating to lower prices — at least not yet.\n\nHere's the deal: Once again, for the gazillionth month in a row, home prices in America hit an all-time high. The median price was $416,000 in June, up 13.4% the same month last year, my colleague Anna Bahney reports . That's ... bananas.\n\nAt the same time, sales fell for the fifth month in a row, down some 14% from a year ago.\n\nNow, in simple economics (the only kind I know), when prices get too high, that should soften demand — which should in turn force prices down. But that takes time, especially when the market is as white-hot as it's been for the past two years.\n\nRight now, it's an awkward moment when neither buyers nor sellers are all that happy.\n\nThere are a few reasons for that:\n\nMortgage rates are double what they were a year ago. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 5.5% this week, up from 2.8% a year ago. Naturally, that's spurring potential buyers to hold off and hope for a better deal.\n\nInventory has improved slightly but remains historically tight. Home builders are slowing construction on new homes, understandably wary of getting caught with a glut if a recession comes along and craters demand.\n\nSellers, meanwhile, may have gotten too greedy. Think about it: How many neighbors or acquaintances do you know who've sold their house for twice what they paid for it, within days of listing? That's the sellers' market everyone's come to expect.\n\nKey quote: \"Buyers can't figure out what is the right price,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told the Wall Street Journal. \"Sellers are very reluctant to give up\" on the price they expected to sell for a few months ago.\n\nSales are likely to keep falling as buyers get priced out by mortgage rates, which are influenced by the Federal Reserve's key interest rate policies. And the Fed is all but guaranteed to keep raising rates aggressively until this historically high inflation reverses course. (Tune in next Wednesday when we see what Jay Powell and his merry band of nerds has in store for us this time...)\n\nDespite that overall sales decline, certain markets are still bumpin'. Miami, for example, saw median home prices rise 40% from a year ago. (Orlando and Nashville homes were up nearly 31%.)\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\n\"A combination of higher prices and higher mortgage rates clearly has shifted the dynamics in the housing market,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Even people who want to buy are simply priced out.\"\n\nEven though home sales have slowed back to a 2019 pace, the market remains head-scratchingly brisk. The number of days a property is on the market before going into contract is the swiftest ever, at 14 days. (A year ago it was 17 days, and a more typical market would see properties on the market for close to 30 days.)\n\n\"Maybe buyers are trying to take advantage of a lower locked-in rate...They want to sign the contract and close the deal quickly,\" Yun said.\n\nBut sellers should take note: This brisk time on the market is not likely to last, Yun said.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 98%\n\nMacao's casinos are hemorrhaging cash under China's strict Covid-19 lockdown orders. The former Portuguese colony-turned-gambling mecca was already hamstrung by the drop in travel during the pandemic, and now analysts are predicting things are about to go from bad to worse. Gross gambling revenue is expected to fall 98% this month compared with July 2019 — and that's assuming casinos reopen next week.\n\nRATIONING BEGINS\n\nTemperatures are scorching across Europe, but leaders are already planning for what may be a long, painful winter.\n\nHere's the deal: The European Union unveiled its emergency gas rationing plan on Wednesday, urging its 27 member states to curb gas demand by 15% and push manufacturers to adopt alternative energy sources.\n\nThis is the rationing moment many Europeans feared would result from Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhy now?\n\nA key natural gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany has been shut down for the past 10 days for routine maintenance. And there's a decent chance, according to European officials, the Russian state-owned gas company will simply refuse to resume deliveries tomorrow when the maintenance is supposed to wrap up.\n\n\"Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon,\" said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThat pipeline, called Nord Stream 1, is a vital artery linking Russia's gas reserves to Europe via Germany. It delivers nearly 40% of the bloc's total pipeline imports from Russia, my colleague Anna Cooban writes\n\nAlready, Russia has shown it is willing to weaponize its energy supplies, cutting off some countries because they refused to pay their bills in rubles (which would violate European sanctions). And last month, Russia cut flows through the pipeline by 60%, blaming the West's sanctions.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said this week that Russia would \"fulfill all of its obligations\" in supplying gas to Europe. But, like, it's Putin — no one knows what to actually expect.\n\nThat uncertainty is a big part of the problem for Europe's economy.\n\nSee here:\n\nFears of energy supply disruptions have pushed benchmark gas prices up by about 85% since the invasion of Ukraine, according to the Intercontinental Exchange.\n\nOn Wednesday, prices rose 5% to as the deadline for the pipeline's reopening inched closer.\n\nLike the United States and other developed economies, Europe is dealing with soaring inflation. And political upheaval. And climate change. And a discernible shift in the direction of the economic rebound.\n\nA European recession isn't a given. But \"a sharp downturn in growth is 100% sure,\" my colleague Julia Horowitz writes.\n\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nEnergy officials say Europe must find ways to save 12 billion cubic meters of gas — equal to about 3% of its annual consumption — over the next 12 weeks to avert disaster.\n\n\"This is a big ask, but it does not exaggerate the scale of what is needed,\" said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, earlier this week.\n\n\"It is categorically not enough to just rely on gas from non-Russian sources — these supplies are simply not available in the volumes required to substitute for missing deliveries from Russia,\" he added.", "authors": ["Analysis Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/05/29/fact-check-online-post-misses-mark-gas-prices-jobs-inflation/7466921002/", "title": "Fact check: Online post misses the mark on gas prices, job growth ...", "text": "The claim: Gas prices are the highest in 10 years, job growth is the worst in 20 years, inflation is the highest in 30 years and illegal immigration is at its highest level in 40 years\n\nThe U.S. continues to crawl out from under the COVID-19 pandemic, but a widely shared Facebook post misses the mark on several indicators about the state of the country.\n\n“Gas prices highest in a decade. Worst jobs report in 2 decades. Highest inflation in 3 decades. Highest increase in illegal immigration in 4 decades,” according to the May 17 post that has been shared more than 1,400 times. “Y’all killed it with your emotional voting skills!”\n\nA picture of a tuxedo-clad Bugs Bunny stares, unamused, at the reader.\n\nGas prices and inflation indeed are rising, and the April jobs report missed economists' expectations. More migrants have tried to enter the United States in the last several months as well.\n\nBut the post is wrong at almost every turn. Gas prices are not their highest of the decade. Job gains in April were far from the worst of the last 20 years, too; the U.S. lost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020 alone. Inflation was higher at the start of the Great Recession.\n\nIllegal immigration is more complicated to track, but apprehensions along the southwest border haven’t yet reached a 40-year record.\n\nFact check:Meme miscaptions image from Beirut port explosion as part of conflict in Middle East\n\nThe Facebook user who shared the post did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGas prices\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of regular gas was about $3.03 on May 26, according to GasBuddy and the AAA auto club.\n\nGas prices haven’t been that high since 2014, but they aren’t the highest in a decade – making this part of the claim FALSE.\n\nThe last time the national average gas price was that high was Oct. 28, 2014, according to daily price data provided by AAA to USA TODAY. Prices were above $3 a gallon every day for nearly 2.5 years beginning on May 26, 2012.\n\nSince the end of October 2014, the price of a gallon of gas hadn’t hit $3 until May 12, but it already was on the rise after sinking during the COVID-19 pandemic as fewer people commuted to work and school and scrapped travel plans.\n\nAAA and Gasbuddy both expected $3 gas in 2021, but AAA spokeswoman Jeannette Casselano said it arrived earlier than anticipated because of the Colonial Pipeline’s temporary shutdown following a ransomware attack.\n\nFact check:Colonial Pipeline gas shortage was result of cyberattack by hackers\n\nPart of the reason for the increase is higher demand. AAA expects the number of travelers driving for the Memorial Day weekend to approach pre-pandemic levels, Casselano said. The price of oil also factors into the cost of gas.\n\nJobs report\n\nThe jobs report was not the worst of the last two decades– so this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released an April jobs report that showed non-farm employment had increased from the previous month by 266,000 to about 144.3 million jobs.\n\nIt wasn’t the worst jobs report of the last 12 months, let alone the last 20 years. The U.S. lost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020 as the economy cratered under the weight of lockdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFact check:Unemployment rate hit historic high, not low, during pandemic\n\nSince 2000, the economy has added fewer than 266,000 jobs 15 times in April. It hasn’t posted a better jobs report in April since 2015, according to a USA TODAY analysis of BLS data.\n\nThe April jobs report missed some economists' expectations for about 1 million jobs to be added in April. Oxford Economics called the miss “one of the largest on record.”\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is not the highest in three decades, as the post claims.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measures inflation in day-to-day living expenses using the Consumer Price Index, which calculates the prices urban consumers pay for a basket of goods and services. It collects prices in 75 urban areas from about 6,000 housing units and 22,000 retail establishments.\n\nIn April, the index rose 4.2% over the previous year, meaning the cost of living expenses increased by 4.2% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe increase in April was the highest inflation since September 2008, though, not the last 30 years– making this part of the claim FALSE.\n\nInflation in September 2008 was 4.9%, according to BLS.\n\nInflation was 4.2% or higher in 11 different months since April 2001, the earliest data available from BLS.\n\nImmigration\n\nMigrant encounters have increased since the start of 2021 along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, assessing whether it is the “highest increase in illegal immigration in four decades” is difficult. We conclude, therefore, that this part of the claim is MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information it could be misleading.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection reported encountering about 178,000 people attempting to enter the country on the southwest border in April, up from about 173,000 in March and 101,000 in February.\n\nThe surge followed a steady uptick since the start of the pandemic. In April 2020, migrant encounters on the southwest border dropped to about 17,000, according to the agency, but have increased every month.\n\nIn March 2020, the Trump administration began using a policy called Title 42, which allows expulsion of undocumented migrants to prevent COVID-19 from spreading in holding facilities. While President Joe Biden has sought to unwind Trump-era immigration policies, his administration has continued to use Title 42.\n\nMore:Joe Biden’s immigration agenda overshadowed by migrant challenges in first 100 days\n\nThat policy accounts for most of the recent encounters Customs and Border Patrol has reported. In April, about 63% of the agency’s encounters on the southwest border were logged under Title 42.\n\nThe addition of Title 42 expulsions makes comparing historical data about southern border crossings difficult.\n\nCustoms and Border Patrol historical data on southwest border apprehensions, done under a separate legal authority called Title 8, show a peak of more than 1.6 million from October 1999 to September 2000, the agency’s fiscal year.\n\nSince October 2020, the start of the current fiscal year, the agency has reported 749,613 total encounters, which includes Title 8 apprehensions and inadmissible individuals and Title 42 expulsions. Apprehensions accounted for 188,191 of that total.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates about 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2018, the most recent year for which its data are available. The unauthorized immigrant population hovered between 10.5 million and 12 million from 2005 to 2018, according to the department’s January 2021 report.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nOverall, the claim that gas prices are the highest in 10 years, job growth is the worst in 20 years, inflation is at its highest level in 30 years and illegal immigration has increased to it highest level in 40 years is FALSE. Gas prices were higher in 2014. The U.S. lost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020. Inflation was higher in 2008 than it is now. Encounters along the southern border have been increasing over the last year, but data for the full fiscal year are not yet available. The addition of Title 42 expulsions also complicates historical comparisons of apprehensions on the southwest border.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

International travelers entering the United States must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within a day of their departure.\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n► Even with testing and reporting interrupted by the Christmas holiday, the United States' case counts grew – 1.29 million in a week, or an average of about 184,000 per day, Johns Hopkins University data shows. Hospitalizations were up and deaths rose slightly, to an average of over 1,300 per day.\n\n► Vice President Kamala Harris declined to blame the unvaccinated for the latest surge. \"But it is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalization if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster,\" she said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n► Mastercard SpendingPulse reported Sunday that U.S. holiday sales rose 8.5% from a year earlier, the biggest annual gain in 17 years. The results cover Nov. 1 through Dec. 24.\n\n► Vermont Everyone Eats, a food assistance program helping state residents, restaurants and farmers get through the pandemic, has been extended through April 1.\n\n► France has recorded more than 100,000 virus infections in a single day for the first time since the pandemic struck. COVID-19 hospitalizations have doubled over the past month.\n\n► More than 160 nonprofits in Rhode Island are sharing $5.4 million in federal coronavirus relief funding for housing, behavioral health services, health care, job training, food pantries and child care for those hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\n📈Today's numbers: The U.S. has recorded more than 52 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 816,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Global totals: More than 279.9 million cases and 5.3 million deaths. More than 204 million Americans – 61.7% – are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\n📘 What we're reading: The omicron variant has thrown America's great return to the office into disarray, perhaps for months. Many companies who had notified employees they would need to come back to the office at least part-time early next year have pushed back those plans or are considering doing so.

Hawaii's are up 44%.\n\nAnd in Louisiana, COVID-19 hospitalizations doubled in the last week. The Louisiana Department of Health said 449 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Sunday. That's the highest since mid-October, which at the time was the state's worst surge.\n\nStatewide, 80% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are not fully vaccinated, the health department reported.\n\nBut the wave is moving unevenly across the country. Nearly half of the states report lower COVID-19 admissions and fewer people in ICU beds.\n\nFauci expects daily infections to rise 'much higher'\n\nThe \"extraordinarily contagious\" omicron variant will continue to drive daily coronavirus infections higher across the nation, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday.\n\n\"Every day it goes up and up. The last weekly average was about 150,000 (per day) and it likely will go much higher,\" Fauci said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's chief medical adviser warned that while studies show omicron is less severe in terms of hospitalizations, more cases still could overwhelm hospitals. He defended the administration's efforts to provide more tests amid a shortage, and said he wished he had thought about ordering 500 million at-home tests two months ago.\n\n\"I think things will improve greatly as we get into January,\" he said. \"But that doesn't help us today and tomorrow.\"\n\nFenway Bowl, Military Bowl shelved as surge cripples college football\n\nThe Fenway Bowl and the Military Bowl were canceled due to the pandemic on Sunday as coronavirus outbreaks at the University of Virginia and Boston College forced the schools to call off postseason plans. The game, scheduled Wednesday at Fenway Park in Boston, was to pit the Cavaliers against Southern Methodist University. The Military Bowl, scheduled Monday in Annapolis, Maryland, between Boston College and East Carolina University, was canceled because of positive COVID-19 tests at BC.\n\n“This is not the way we wanted to see this season come to an end,” BC coach Jeff Hafley said. “We just do not have enough players to safely play a game.\"\n\nThe Hawaii Bowl was canceled last week after Hawaii withdrew from the game against the University of Memphis. And Rutgers will replace Texas A&M in the Gator Bowl against Wake Forest on New Year’s Eve after the Aggies pulled out because of a lack of available players.\n\nFlorida sets infection records two days in a row\n\nFlorida hit a record in the pandemic for the second day in a row, with 32,850 new cases reported Saturday. The 31,758 cases reported Friday had broken the state's previous record of more than 27,000, set in August during the height of the delta wave. The current surge is driven by the highly contagious omicron variant, public health experts say.\n\nThe swelling number of cases increased demand for COVID-19 tests, even on Christmas Day. Hours before a testing site opened at Tropical Park in Miami, dozens of cars lined up outside the entrance. The testing site was open from mid-morning to mid-afternoon; two other sites in Miami-Dade County were open on Christmas Day.\n\nNBA urges booster shots for players\n\nThe NBA’s Christmas message to its teams was a refrain it has been using for weeks: Get boosted.\n\nWith the number of players on the league’s health and safety protocols list hovering around 100 – and with Chicago coach Billy Donovan now dealing with those protocols as well, calling into question his availability for the next few Bulls games – the league and the National Basketball Players Association continue to hammer home the importance of booster shots.\n\nBy Dec. 31, every NBA team must arrange a booster-shot event for players, staff and family members, the latest mandate from the league in its quest to get its skyrocketing infections under control. The NBA has told teams its data shows that boosters substantially reduce a person’s risk of being infected, but one out of every three players hasn't gotten a booster shot. About 97% of the league is vaccinated.\n\nThat comes as the league’s Jan. 5 booster mandate looms for all eligible scorer’s table personnel, team attendants and other staff who interact in person with players or referees. In almost all cases, if people in those positions don’t have boosters by Jan. 5, they won’t be allowed to continue in those jobs.\n\nPositive COVID test? Here’s what to do.\n\nTesting positive for COVID-19 starts a confusing, disruptive and at times frightening process – one that millions of Americans will likely go through in the coming weeks as the omicron variant rapidly spreads this holiday season.\n\nFirst, you need to isolate. That’s a more intense version of quarantining – it means cutting off contact with other people as much as possible so you reduce the chance of infecting them. This also means forgoing travel, not going to work and even limiting contact with people in your own household who aren't infected.\n\nThe CDC says isolating is a necessary step whether you’re vaccinated or unvaccinated, and whether you have symptoms or feel fine.\n\nEveryone who tests positive for COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms. And people who are unvaccinated or at high risk for severe disease should be extra vigilant for symptoms that might require emergency care. Call your doctor for early treatment options.\n\nHow long should you isolate? How long will I be contagious? What if you are a close contact with someone who tested positive? Here’s what you should know about omicron and COVID this holiday season.\n\nContributing: Mike Stucka, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/04/14/california-turning-point-crime-homelessness/7214726001/", "title": "Is California, one of the bluest states in the US, at a turning point ...", "text": "Crime rates tell a complicated story, with homicides on a rise, but burglary at historic lows.\n\nIncidents, cries for change led to public officials announcing new measures, shifting tone\n\nRecent polls show voters are fed up and losing faith in leaders to solve these issues.\n\nLOS ANGELES – Ron Wyghtman has watched L.A. and his small corner of Venice change drastically over decades.\n\nThe 66-year-old remembers when the city saw violent crime reach historic highs in the 1990s with gangs, murders and a crack epidemic.

This increases the risk of fire while the vehicles are being driven or are parked.\n\nAffected are certain Kia Sportage SUVs from 2014 through 2016, and the 2016 through 2018 K900 sedan. Recalled Hyundais include certain 2016 through 2018 Santa Fe SUVs, 2017 and 2018 Santa Fe Sports, the 2019 Santa Fe XL and 2014 and 2015 Tucson SUVs.\n\nA ROUGH RIDE:Peloton co-founder steps down\n\n'PAIN AT THE PUMP':Your medium-sized car costs you $12 more per tank of gas than a year ago\n\nThe automakers say they have 11 reports of fires in the U.S. but no injuries.\n\nDocuments posted Tuesday by U.S. safety regulators say owners should park the vehicles outside and away from structures until repairs are made.\n\nDealers will replace a fuse. In addition, Hyundai dealers will inspect the control modules and replace them if needed. Hyundai will mail notification letters starting April 5, and Kia will send them March 31.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says owners can go www.nhtsa.gov and enter their 17-digit vehicle identification number to see if their automobile is being recalled.\n\nHyundai said that when it finds a safety defect “we act swiftly and efficiently to recall the vehicle and fix the problem at no cost to affected customers.”\n\nKia said there are warning signs that drivers could see or smell. The antilock brake warning light could come on, and they could smell something burning or melting, or see smoke coming from the engine compartment.\n\nCONSUMER RECALLS:A database of the latest product recalls\n\nTuesday's recalls come after U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stepped up a series of investigations into engine compartment fires that have plagued the Korean automakers.\n\nIn December, the agency consolidated two investigations from 2017 into a new a new engineering analysis covering more than 3 million vehicles from the 2011 through 2016 model years. At the time, NHTSA had received 161 complaints of engine fires, some of which occurred in vehicles that had already been recalled.\n\nThe first recall from the companies related to engine failures and fires reaches to September 2015. Since then they have issued at least eight more recalls for a host of engine problems, according to NHTSA documents.\n\nThe agency said it’s evaluating whether previous recalls covered enough vehicles. It also will monitor the effectiveness of previous recalls “as well as the long-term viability of related programs and non-safety field actions being conducted by Hyundai and Kia.\"\n\nAt the time, the automakers said they have undertaken numerous recalls to address engine issues, including recalls, new engine monitoring technology and providing extended warranties.\n\nMichael Brooks, chief counsel for the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the recalls Tuesday are different from the engine failure problem that caused most of the previous Hyundai-Kia fire recalls. “Although NHTSA has the authority to order a recall and potentially a buyback of all affected vehicles, the separate fire defects that have plagued millions of Hyundai vehicles across multiple model years makes this a very difficult task,\" he said.\n\nIn November of 2020, NHTSA announced that Kia and Hyundai must pay $137 million in fines and for safety improvements because they moved too slowly to recall more than 1 million vehicles with engines that can fail. The fines resolved a previous probe into the companies’ behavior involving recalls of multiple models dating to the 2011 model year.\n\nKia was to pay $27 million and invest $16 million in safety performance measures. Another $27 million payment will be deferred as long as Kia meets safety conditions, NHTSA said.\n\nKia denied the U.S. allegations but said it wanted to avoid a protracted legal fight.\n\nData collected by the Center for Auto Safety show more than 30 U.S. fire and engine-related recalls from Hyundai and Kia since 2015. The recalls involve more than 20 models from the 2006 through 2021 model years totaling over 8.4 million vehicles.\n\nMany of the recalls involved manufacturing defects that stopped oil from flowing through the engine block. Many involved expensive engine replacements.\n\nHyundai and Kia also did a U.S. “product improvement campaign” covering 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/business/hyundai-kia-fire-recall/index.html", "title": "Hyundai and Kia tell owners of 500,000 vehicles to park outside - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Hyundai and Kia are telling owners of almost 500,000 cars and SUVs in the United States to park outside and away from buildings due to a possible defect that can cause the vehicles to spontaneously catch fire even when not running.\n\nThe problem is that, due to \"foreign contaminants,\" the anti-lock brake computer control module can short circuit and possibly start a fire in the engine compartment. Hyundai issued a recall for 2016-2018 model year Santa Fe SUVs, 2017-2018 Santa Fe Sport SUVs, 2019 Santa Fe XL models and 2014-2015 Tucson SUVs. Kia is recalling 2016-2018 K900 sedans and 2014-2016 Sportage SUVs. In total, Hyundai is recallng 357,830 vehicles while Kia is recalling 126,747.\n\nDealers will inspect the vehicles' anti-lock braking control module, a small computer system that controls the vehicle's emergency anti-lock braking system, and may replace it with a new one. Dealers will also replace a fuse that controls the electric current to the anti-lock braking control unit at no cost to owners. The new fuse will reduce the amount of power going into the module.\n\nHave you read these yet?

The financial fallout of playing a season during the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to be steep and the variables were seemingly endless.\n\nWould fans be able to attend games? And at what capacity could Michigan Stadium be filled? The answer to each question, and several others, would have a corresponding impact on how much money the department bled. At worst, the Wolverines' share of Big Ten Network's media rights deal — a whopping $55 million in 2019 — could help keep the department stable.\n\nSo, as Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel presented in June his annual budget to the university's board of regents for the 2021 fiscal year, he did it preparing for something short of the worst: a $26.1 million deficit for the department.\n\nAnd that was before the Big Ten postponed the cash cow that is college football.\n\nThree months later, Michigan is in fact bracing for the unknown in the wake of the conference's decision to indefinitely delay fall sports because of the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"The reality is that our immediate decrease in resources threatens the support we are able to offer our student-athletes for the foreseeable future,\" Manuel wrote in a letter to season-ticket holders Aug. 6.\n\nA Michigan football operation that generated a $74.8 million surplus during the 2019 fiscal year — the most recent year of NCAA records available — has been dammed by a financial situation shrouded in historic uncertainty. A department-wide revenue stream approaching $200 million is now expected to be slashed in half in what easily could be the most significant financial fallout in the department's history, according to information compiled by USA TODAY Sports in partnership with Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\n\"The impact is upwards of almost half our budget,\" Manuel estimated recently, during an appearance on Jon Jansen's \"Conqu'ring Heroes\" podcast. \"About $100 million.\"\n\nAnd the Wolverines aren't alone. Without college football, the state of Michigan's five FBS athletic departments will swallow millions of dollars — with the two Big Ten programs, Michigan and Michigan State, slated to lose the most.\n\n'A lot of turbulence'\n\nAthletic departments nationwide experienced spikes in football revenue in the years before the pandemic, and Michigan was no exception. The Wolverines topped $100 million during the 2017 fiscal year, and the number jumped to more than $120 million in 2018 and 2019.\n\nTo provide a sense of how important football is to the financial health of the department, Michigan generated $122.3 million in total football revenue during the 2019 fiscal year, or nearly 62% of the $197.8 million the athletic department raked in for games played from the fall of 2018 through the spring of 2019. With expenses approaching $191 million, the department operated at a surplus of nearly $6.9 million after the football team played a 12-game regular season and reached the Peach Bowl.\n\nWhen Manuel presented his budget June 25, he was forced to guess what football might look like in the fall. At the time, the COVID-19 outbreak was stabilizing in Michigan, and there was hope that not only would a season be played, but a reduced number of fans could attend games at Michigan Stadium, the largest college venue in the nation.\n\nManuel figured the department would lose 50% of ticket sales among all sports, with football delivering the brunt of the hit. He figured the department would also lose $17 million in preferred seat contributions — the donor gifts that go to the department when season tickets are purchased. And he factored in the uncertainty of conference contributions and TV revenue, among other things.\n\n“There is still a lot of turbulence about what is going to happen,\" Manuel said as he presented his budget. \"We don’t really know. We have multiple models, although I am presenting one to you. But we will adjust accordingly and move forward.”\n\nMoney to be made\n\nThe Big Ten, as of now, isn't expected to play football this fall. But even if it does and the conference implements a 10-game conference-only schedule — as it had planned to do beginning Sept. 5 — there are any number of other factors that could impact the deficit Manuel outlined.\n\nIf no games are played this fiscal year, the fallout could be catastrophic. But with college football already being played in other sections of the country — particularly the ACC, Big 12 and SEC — and with the Big Ten's medical subcommittee set to present options for a a safe return this fall, according to ESPN, the better bet is for competition to resume in some capacity.\n\nWhich means there's money to be made.\n\nMichigan and Michigan State each earned just north of $34.9 million in media rights for football during the 2019 fiscal year, which covers the 2018 season.\n\nThe payout in large part is based on the number of total home games played in the conference in a given year.\n\nWhile the formula for payouts could be altered based on how TV networks value the addition of a 10th conference game (the Big Ten traditionally has played nine) and the timing of the games in general, it's reasonable to assume most of the media rights money can be salvaged.\n\nIn fact, a conservative estimate conducted by USA TODAY Sports and shown to the Chicago-based analytics firm, Navigate, shows the potential for conference schools to earn nearly $30 million in football media rights during a 10-game conference-only schedule this season — a 15% monetary decline that would correspond directly with fewer home games being played this season (70) than in 2018 (82).\n\n\"If they play in spring, there are reasons there could be a dip in ratings,\" Matt Balvanz, Navigate’s Senior Vice President of Analytics, told the Free Press. \"But there are reasons to be optimistic for college football after a long layoff.\n\n\"We've seen both sides since sports have come back. When NASCAR returned, ratings were initially high, but now they’ve dipped. In the NBA, we've seen the same thing. It’s really a mixed bag.\"\n\nNeither the NBA, NHL nor Major League Baseball has allowed fans to attend games since resuming competition. And while the NFL season opened Thursday with a limited number of fans (15,895) in Kansas City, the Detroit Lions aren't planning for fans until at least November.\n\nStill, while it's hard to say how much TV advertisers will value a spring Big Ten season, the NFL's fan experiment could be a beta test for Michigan and Michigan State hosting fans whenever Big Ten football finally does kick off.\n\nMichigan raked in $46.3 million in football ticket revenue during a seven-game home slate in the 2019 fiscal year. If Michigan were to fill Michigan Stadium to 20% capacity — as Kansas City did with Arrowhead Stadium on Thursday night — then it's conceivable U-M could recoup $6.6 million or more in ticket sales, assuming ticket prices from the 2019 fiscal year stay relatively the same.\n\nIn either case, when considering the uncertainty of TV revenue, ticket sales and other factors, it's easy to understand how Manuel was able to project the first deficit for Michigan in the history of USA Today's financial database, which lists expenses and revenues dating to 2005.\n\n\"There remain many unknowns in the event of a canceled 2020-21 athletic season (all sports),\" said associate athletic director Kurt Svoboda. \"In our last fiscal year, 2020, spectator admissions to athletic events totaled $56.6 million. That figure could theoretically go to zero without our hosting any events.\n\n\"That figure could also be more or less, depending on what ticket holders and donors choose to do with their existing tickets and personal seat contributions (we have several options for people to consider).\"\n\nMoney to be saved\n\nManuel's deficit accounted for significant losses, but it didn't account for the millions Michigan would spend in COVID-19 testing.\n\nAlready, U-M has administered nearly 4,600 tests to athletes and staff members, at a cost of about $75 per test. And the frequency isn't expected to slow down as teams on campus continue working out and eventually return to competition.\n\nIn addition, the NCAA has extended the eligibility for fall and spring athletes, meaning those who were unable to compete because of COVID-19-related cancellations can return for another season. The fallout could force Michigan — and Michigan State, for that matter — to shell out significantly more in scholarship dollars in the coming years.\n\nTo offset the rising costs, Michigan already has begun looking for ways to save.\n\nMichigan football coach Jim Harbaugh — along with basketball coach Juwan Howard and other head coaches employed by the school — accepted 10% salary reductions through the end of the fiscal year. U-M also announced Sept. 1 that it had laid off 21 employees within the department, and more cost-saving measures are likely to come as the conference determines the fate of the football season.\n\nIn addition, Manuel has implored football season-ticket holders to either convert their preferred seat contribution or season-ticket payment to a tax-deductible gift or to roll the payments forward to another year. Michigan is offering benefits to those who donate.\n\nIn the letter he sent to season-ticket holders Aug. 6, he said he was budgeting for a $61 million decrease in revenue for 2021 and said the number could double if no sports are played.\n\n\"Given the anticipated loss of revenue due to limited or no fans at our games,\" Manuel wrote, \"our department faces an unparalleled level of financial uncertainty.\n\n\"Without additional resources, the level of investment in our programs will have to be reduced even further.\"\n\nMore:Jim Harbaugh's Michigan football pay cut restores balance after 10% raise\n\nThe road ahead\n\nMichigan is not alone in its budget tightrope.\n\nThe fallout is expected to be nearly as significant for Michigan State after its football program generated $80 million in revenue for 2019 — or 57% of all athletic department revenue.\n\n“At this point, we have modeled some fairly severe budget reductions, that probably if we don’t play football, we would not be playing most other, maybe all other, sports,” MSU athletic director Bill Beekman told the Economic Club of the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce in August.\n\nLike Michigan, MSU has cut salaries for coaches and athletic department personnel. And so have Mid-American Conference programs such as Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan and Western Michigan.\n\nThose three schools already are dealing with the loss of millions in game guarantee payments — the money schools receive from playing nonconference matchups on the road — after programs around the country shifted to mostly conference-only football schedules or canceled their seasons.\n\nAnd CMU has cut its track and field programs during the pandemic, a move that forced it to ask the NCAA for a waiver just to remain in the FBS, the highest level of college football.\n\nThe fallout likely won't stop there.\n\nIt could continue into the winter months.\n\nAnd for Manuel and Michigan, what happens during that time period will determine just how steep the deficit actually will be.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Steve Berkowitz and Craig Lyons contributed to this report.\n\nContact Orion Sang: osang@freepress.com.

So is Tiffany Haddish, who has prominent roles in a whopping eight movies in 2018 and 2019, and Margot Robbie, who stars in six.\n\nTheir ubiquity made us wonder: Who else leads that list? Using casting and search data from Movie Insider and IMDb, we analyzed actors' recent starring film roles, upcoming projects and page views, with consideration given to name recognition.\n\nOur ranking includes Oscar winners, action stars, independent film stars/producers and character actors, though unsurprisingly, there are some big gaps in our findings. The movie business still skews white and male, and so does this list. There are also two men who have been accused of abusive behavior toward women, which doesn't seem to have diminished their ability to find work.\n\nBut there’s reason to expect progress in the years to come: Haddish, one of three women and three actors of color to make our top 10, was relatively unknown just last summer.\n\n\"What stands out is that this group of actors is truly cross-generational, a mix of old school and new school, with some representing multiple decades in the business, alongside dynamic young stars that are relatively early in their careers,\" Dergarabedian says. \"Given the impressive and growing influence of women both behind and in front of the camera, future lists of this type will likely see a greater number of female creatives among the ranks.\"\n\n1. James Franco\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Franco starred opposite his brother, Dave, in \"The Disaster Artist\" last December and won a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy. In May, he played a warlord in \"Future World,\" which was savaged by critics (zero percent positive reviews) on aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007), $151.1 million\n\nNext roles: He has a handful of indie projects geared up for the next year, including the action drama \"Blood Heist.\" And he'll lend his voice as James the Bottlenose Dolphin in the all-star cast of \"Naya Legend of the Golden Dolphin.\"\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: It's tough to reach a consensus here: Franco has mastered playing an array of mustachioed arthouse-cinema weirdos. It's also worth noting that he does a ton of TV work, too (most recently starring in HBO's \"The Deuce\"), but made this list on the basis of his film accomplishments alone. But he has also been accused by multiple women of inappropriate sexual behavior in work settings. (Franco says those allegations aren't accurate.)\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Quintessential summer action flicks “Skyscraper” and “Rampage,” both in theaters now.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: “Furious 7” (2015), $147.2 million\n\nNext roles: How much time do you have? Johnson stars in the wrestling drama “Fighting With My Family” (slated for March 1) and “Jungle Cruise” (Oct. 11, 2019) based on the Disneyland ride. Farther down the road, he’s in preproduction for his “Fast & Furious” spinoff \"Hobbs & Shaw\" (next July), \"Jumanji” sequel (Dec. 13, 2019) and four other projects. He'll also take on the starring role in DC supervillain flick “Black Adam,” which is still in development. And hopefully, he'll take a nap soon.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: Johnson is the perfect action star, with a combination of ridiculous athleticism and solid comedic timing. His energy is contagious: We all simultaneously want to be him, be best friends with him, and see him in the Oval Office with Tom Hanks (who also made this list) as a running mate. \"Given his unwavering work ethic and tireless marketing efforts on behalf of his films, he is a franchise booster when he joins any cast, and possesses the physical presence to solidify his status as a bigger-than-life action star,\" Dergarabedian says.\n\n3. Octavia Spencer\n\nWhat you’ve seen her in lately: Spencer earned her third Oscar nomination last year for her supporting role in \"The Shape of Water.\" She also was featured in the 2017 sleeper hits \"Gifted\" (with Chris Evans) and faith-based \"The Shack.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Zootopia\" (2016), $75.1 million\n\nNext roles: She'll play the title character's teacher in an adaptation of the play \"Luce,\" which explores race and privilege in America. She'll also be featured in the comedy \"Instant Family\" as a social worker in Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne's journey through adopting three children.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of her: Spencer is Hollywood's go-to supporting actress, with a win and two nominations in the category at the Academy Awards. She's nailed the role of everything from nurse to neighbor, and we're ready to see her cast in a lead role.\n\n4. Margot Robbie\n\nWhat you’ve seen her in lately: Last year, Robbie took on the titular role in the Tonya Harding biopic \"I, Tonya\" and played author A.A. Milne's wife, Daphne, in \"Goodbye Christopher Robin.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Suicide Squad\" (2016), $133.7 million\n\nNext roles: You can see Robbie as Queen Elizabeth I, starring opposite Saoirse Ronan in \"Mary Queen of Scots\" (Dec. 7). She's also poised to bring back Harley Quinn in a slew of announced DC Comics movies.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of her: From over-the-top characters like Naomi in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" to quieter roles like Flopsy in \"Peter Rabbit,\" Robbie proves her acting tool kit is well-stocked. \"Robbie has a depth, grit and edge that few of her peers can match (and) has a great eye for interesting material,\" Dergarabedian says. \"Definitely one to watch.\"\n\n5. Nicolas Cage\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Cage's success may be more closely associated with his roles in the '80s, '90s and 2000s, but he still has a full movie agenda. He starred in the thriller \"Looking Glass\" in February and action flick \"211\" earlier this summer.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Ghost Rider\" (2007), $45.4 million\n\nNext roles: In a pretty typical Nicolas Cage role, he stars in \"Mandy,\" a psychedelic horror film in which his character must rescue a woman from a sadistic cult (Sept. 14). He'll also lend his voice to the animated \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" (Dec. 14) that features multiple parallel dimensions worth of Spider-Men. This month, he voices Superman in \"Teen Titans GO! to the Movies\" (July 27), years after he was famously cast as the Man of Steel in Tim Burton's abandoned Superman movie.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: He may be better known lately as the punchline to many an internet joke, but he's also a solid character actor who pushes boundaries and experiments with his roles in a way most actors don't.\n\n6. Tiffany Haddish\n\nWhat you’ve seen her in lately: Still an up-and-comer in Hollywood, Haddish is most recognizable for her role as Dina in last summer's \"Girls Trip,\" and is in theaters now in \"Uncle Drew.\" She also recently hosted \"Saturday Night Live,\" where she notably worked her monologue around wearing the same Alexander McQueen dress she wore to the \"Girls Trip\" premiere.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Girls Trip\" (2017), $31.2 million\n\nNext roles: Get ready to see a lot more of Haddish: She has prominent roles in seven more projects expected to hit theaters this year or the next. Most notably, she'll co-star with Kevin Hart in the comedy \"Night School\" (Sept. 28) and lend her voice to \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part\" (Feb. 8).\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of her: Her energy and charisma are out of this world. Haddish is unapologetically herself and commands a scene with natural delivery and perfect comedic timing. Dergarabedian calls her \"a rare talent, and someone to look out for in the years to come.\"\n\n7. Woody Harrelson\n\nWhat you've seen him in lately: Harrelson played the morally ambiguous criminal Beckett in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" and police chief Willoughby in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" which earned him his third Oscar nomination.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" (2013), $158.1 million\n\nNext roles: After a good deal of secrecy, Harrelson confirmed he has a part in the upcoming \"Spider-Man\" spinoff \"Venom.\" No official word yet on his role, though there's speculation he may be playing the villain Carnage. And a \"Zombieland\" sequel was just announced, with the four major stars (Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) set to return in time for an October 2019 release, the 10th anniversary of the original.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: Harrelson is often typecast in the drunken, snarky mentor role – an oddly specific character, but nevertheless one that he can tap into better than anyone.\n\n8. Johnny Depp\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Depp reprised his famous Capt. Jack Sparrow character in 2017's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" and was featured in the star-studded \"Murder on the Orient Express\" remake.\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" (2006), $135.6 million\n\nNext roles: He plays LAPD detective Russell Poole in \"City of Lies\" (Sept. 7), a biopic about the Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. murder investigations. Amid much controversy, he's also slated to play Gellert Grindelwald in the second \"Fantastic Beasts\" film (Nov. 16).\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: Depp is the king of thoroughly transforming into an impressive variety of out-of-this-world characters. But allegations against him off-camera (ex-wife Amber Heard has accused him of physical abuse, which Depp denied) make it difficult to say we \"can't get enough of him.\"\n\n9. Chris Pratt\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: Pratt reprised his role as Owen Grady in \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\" earlier this summer, as well as Peter Quill/Star-Lord in \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018), $257.7 million\n\nNext roles: He'll again lend his voice as Emmet Brickowski in \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.\" And he'll be back in a third \"Jurassic World\" flick in 2021.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: We first got to know Pratt as the lovably dumb, chubby Andy Dwyer on \"Parks and Recreation.\" He may look like a bona fide action star now, but the humor remains. His transformation from small-screen comedy star to Marvel superhero \"was as unexpected as it was welcomed,\" Dergarabedian adds.\n\n10. Tom Hanks\n\nWhat you’ve seen him in lately: As Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee in Oscar best-picture nominee \"The Post\" and as tech company head Bailey opposite Emma Watson in \"The Circle.\"\n\nBiggest box-office opening: \"Toy Story 3\" (2010), $110.3 million\n\nNext roles: Hanks is reprising his role as Woody in \"Toy Story 4\" (we're not crying, you're crying), and will play Fred Rogers in \"You Are My Friend.\" (OK, fine, we're crying.) Both are slated for 2019.\n\nWhy we can’t get enough of him: From rom-coms and biopics to action and animation, Hanks does it all. He's even secured an interesting role outside of the movie world: He's America's dad. As Dergarabedian notes, \"He'll go down as one of the greatest and most beloved actors of all-time. Full stop.\"\n\nMethodology: We began with Movie Insider's lists of most prolific actors for 2017 to 2019 and data provided by IMDb of the 50 actors with the most page views since 2012​​​​​​. From there, we determined how many of each actor’s roles were starring (or close to starring) and the number of confirmed future projects. For tiebreakers, we considered their IMDb current STARmeter ranking – an algorithm that calculates which actors people are most interested in – and whether they're a household name.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2020/12/04/how-pga-tour-survived-and-how-golf-has-thrived-during-pandemic/6460130002/", "title": "How the PGA Tour survived and how golf has thrived during pandemic", "text": "The PGA Tour had 19 positive \"in-market tests\" among 6,682 players and caddies\n\nTV ratings were strong, especially early-round coverage\n\nGolf participation, equipment sales are up at a level not seen since the Tiger Woods Era began\n\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan used the fine spring weather the First Coast enjoyed in late March and April to do what he urged golf fans on the day he had to announce the cancelation of The Players Championship.\n\nHe put a tee in the ground and played golf.\n\nMonahan would go to the TPC Sawgrass Players Stadium Course, usually on Sunday mornings, and get in nine or 18 holes at the home of The Players, reflecting on the possible loss of the 2019-20 season and the massive undertaking it would require to resume competition.\n\n\"The first six weeks of the pandemic, when everybody was working around the clock, one of the things I did to clear my mind and get fresh air was to play the TPC every Sunday morning,\" Monahan said. \"Golf was something everyone could still do.\"\n\nRefreshed and invigorated by playing the sport he was trying to salvage at its highest level, Monahan would then return to his home office and plow into the seemingly monumental task of getting his membership back on the golf course.\n\nAnd with the help of his staff, the Tour membership, tournament committees, TV partners and volunteers -- to say nothing of the cooperation of the players in plying their trade under difficult circumstances -- the Tour returned in early June and never stopped -- even though losses by the end of the year could be as much as $90 million, according to a video address Monahan made to his staff last summer when he announced layoffs.\n\nBut in terms of a lack of interruptions to the schedule (none) and minimal positive tests (19 players and caddies out of 6,682 who played or toted the bags in 26 events through this week's Mayakoba Championship), the PGA Tour was rivaled only by the NBA and NASCAR for being able to complete a season -- and also get 12 tournaments into the next -- during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTour relied on personal responsibility\n\nThe positivity rate just for players and caddies who were tested on-site was .003. The rates have been similar for the 17 Korn Ferry Tour and 10 PGA Tour Champions events through this week.\n\nThe three Tours combined to play 53 events since golf resumed on June 8. None were delayed because of the coronavirus. The 19 PGA Tour players and caddies who tested positive were fewer than a recent outbreak on one NFL team, the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Tour has a \"bubble,\" but unlike the NBA, where players were sequestered at Disney World and all of the games played there, it's largely dependent on personal responsibility as the Tour has hop-scotched through 14 states, plus Mexico, Bermuda and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAn aspect of PGA Tour culture had to be factored in: players are independent contractors, not members of a team beholden to a coach, general manager, or owner. They play wherever they please.\n\nThe Tour set up charter flights and designated hotels for Tour players and caddies to stay to minimize contact in public. Going out to dinner or otherwise being out and about was discouraged. Testing was required to get onto charter flights and to be on the grounds of next week's tournament.\n\nPlayers had to get used to room service meals (some rented houses and hired chefs for the week), couldn't work out at hotel or resort facilities and until late in the season, couldn't have their wives, girlfriends or other family members attend tournaments.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" said Davis Love III of St. Simons Island, Ga., the host for the RSM Classic at the Sea Island Club. \"Our game changes every week; we go to a new city, new rules, new challenges. It just gets harder and harder, not easier and easier.\"\n\nLove said it wasn't just players, caddies, PGA Tour and tournament staff that had to exhibit responsible behavior to keep the Tour going. Each event still needed dozens of volunteers for scoring, player hospitality, course preparation and other on-site duties such as parking.\n\n\"If our volunteers didn't buy in, get tested, follow protocols ... it's twice, three times as much work for our volunteers now,\" Love said. \"Everything is more difficult to put on these tournaments. So it really is amazing.\"\n\nWhile the Tour has released the names of the players and caddies who tested positive (world No. 1-ranked Dustin Johnson and Adam Scott were the two biggest names to miss events), it has been quick to add that those are only for \"in-market tests.\" It's unknown how many might have tested positive during a break from playing.\n\nHowever, it's clear if they did, they stayed away until they were no longer contagious.\n\nPro-ams resumed, some fans allowed\n\nThere have been scattered attempts at normalcy. A limited number of fans were allowed at Bermuda and Houston, the first time fans were allowed to watch a competition PGA Tour round since March 12 at The Players.\n\nThe Tour resumed pro-ams, an important function of the charity dollars each event can contribute, at the Corales Punta Cana Dominican Championship in late September.\n\nThe Tour is off until the Sentry Tournament of Champions on Maui, Hawaii Jan. 7-10, where a small number of spectators will be allowed. The Sony Open in Honolulu, the American Express Championship in La Quinta, Calif., and the Farmers Insurance Open in La Jolla, Calif., have said they will not sell tickets.\n\nOrganizers at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, the Tour event that annually draws the most fans, are working with local health officials to permit some fans when it's played Feb. 4-7.\n\nVaccines may be rolled out in late December but the first wave will be prioritized for the elderly, health-care providers and first responders. It's not clear when enough PGA Tour players, caddies, staffers and fans will be vaccinated to enable a further return to normal.\n\nMonahan said there is every intention of completing an ambitious 2020-21 PGA Tour schedule that has 50 events and six majors -- since the 2020 Masters and U.S. Open were moved to the fall.\n\nThat includes The Players Championship March 11-14 at the Players Stadium Course.\n\nNot to be overlooked has been the quality of the competition since the Tour returned. Rising stars Byson DeChambeau (U.S. Open) and Collin Morikawa (PGA) captured their first major championships and Dustin Johnson dominated the late summer and fall to win the FedEx Cup and the Masters.\n\nThe PGA Tour Champions, which re-started in late August, got a shot of star power when Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk both won their first two starts and Ernie Els, Steve Stricker and Darren Clarke also won.\n\nThe summer events on the Korn Ferry Tour produced rising stars such as Will Zalatoris, Taylor Pendrith, Davis Riley and Jared Wolfe, a Nocatee resident.\n\nThe Tour also strengthened both itself and the European PGA Tour with the announcement of an alliance involving global TV rights, marketing and streamlined scheduling in the future.\n\nWhile the Tour has been able to resume a full schedule during the pandemic, there have been still been repercussions.\n\nPGA Tour charity will be down\n\nThere's no getting away from it: the PGA Tour's ability to contribute tournament proceeds to charity has been severely restricted with no fans and pro-ams resuming only six weeks ago.\n\nThe Tour contributed $204.3 million to charity in 2019, pushing the all-time total to more than $3 billion since 1933.\n\nFirst Coast charities received $9.25 million from the 2019 Players Championship, bumping the total since 1977, when the tournament was first played at the Sawgrass Country Club, to more than $100 million.\n\nThose kind of numbers are hardly possible with no fans, corporate hospitality or pro-ams on the pre-pandemic level, along with losing 30 percent of the Tour season to events that were canceled.\n\nHowever, the Tour has gotten creative. The two exhibitions that preceded the opening of golf, with Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Dustin Johnson and Matthew Wolf playing at the Seminole Country Club; and Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady at The Medalist, combined to raise more than $15 million for charity, and the Tour reports that it has raised a total of more than $30 million for COVID-related relief efforts through other efforts of players, tournaments and corporate partners.\n\nMonahan said even the tournaments that were canceled have been able to impact charity.\n\nThe Players Championship is one of them, with the tournament able to assist several charities as part of their fall \"Red Coat Ride Out.\"\n\nThe Tesori Family Foundation resumed its series of \"All-Star Clinics\" for special-needs children.\n\nThe RSM Classic at Sea Island was able to hold its \"Birdies Fore Love\" campaign, where players who had the most birdies in the first 11 fall events. A total of $500,000 was donated.\n\nThe PGA Tour conducted nine charity events at Tour sites on Wednesdays, raising more than $4.5 million.\n\nPGA Tour operations take hits\n\nThe loss of tournament revenue has also affected the Tour in Ponte Vedra. It announced this summer that around four dozen employees were laid off, spread out over nine departments.\n\nMonahan declined to confirm the amount of money the Tour has lost, or further discuss the layoffs. The total financial effects of the pandemic to the Tour's bottom line might not be completely known until late next year because as a 501 (c) (6) tax-exempt organization, it has until October of 2021 to file this year's return.\n\nMonahan said the Tour has reserves that will bridge the time until a nine-year, $700 million TV and digital rights deal begins in 2022 -- which was announced four days before The Players was canceled.\n\nMonahan is forgoing his salary for the balance of the pandemic, which was $3.9 million annually based on the Tour's latest available tax filing, and his executive staff agreed to salary cuts.\n\nThe Tour can't cut purses and bank the savings because those funds come from title sponsors and TV rights. If the Tour did adjust prize money, it would likely have to be refunded to those constituents.\n\nThe Tour, in a statement, said maintaining purses (which can be as high as $15 million (for The Players and FedEx Cup Championship), is the key to making sure the world's best players continue teeing it up.\n\nLosing those players, especially with an alternative looming (the on-again, off-again Premier Golf Tour) would impact overall tournament revenue, which ultimately would affect charitable giving.\n\nThe Tour also is going ahead with its plan to move its 800 local employees into the new \"Global Home\" Headquarters building in January. Construction has not been delayed and Tour officials said costs have remained within the original budget of $65 million for the 187,000-square-foot structure.\n\nThe recent layoffs also won't impact the Tour's pledge to St. Johns County in 2017 to hire 307 more employees over a 10-year period in exchange for nearly $2.8 million in incentives that include expedited permitting, an economic development grant for up to 100 percent of fees paid to the county (impact fees and water/sewer connection fees) plus four years of ad valorem taxes (general county portion) on capital improvements and tangible personal property valued at $86 million.\n\nThe first annual grant payment is anticipated to come during the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nIn a statement, the Tour pointed out that staff attrition was built into that projection.\n\nYounger demographic bumped ratings\n\nFans may not have been able to watch golf in person but they did on TV -- at least until football season began.\n\nThe early-round coverage of PGA Tour events on Golf Channel for the first 12 events after competition resumed was up 50 percent over comparable events in 2010, and up a whopping 96 percent for the 25-54 age group.\n\nEarly-round coverage through the RSM Classic was the most-watched for the same or comparable events since the beginning of the FedEx Cup Era in 2007.\n\n\"Golf became very meaningful for viewers who were starved for live sports,\" said Tom Knapp, executive vice-president of programming for the NBC Sports Group. \"Golf and NASCAR were the first sports back and I think we took for granted how much sports meant to viewers and our lifestyle. When golf came back, folks turned it on.\"\n\nKnapp was especially pleased with the younger demographics of golf viewers.\n\n\"Younger folks seeking competition on TV watched golf in bigger numbers when it came back,\" he said. \"Then they saw the young, dynamic, athletic players on the leaderboard each week and identified with them. We're building a future fan base that thinks golf is cool, just as a generation thought golf was cool when Tiger Woods first came out.\"\n\nThe final round of the PGA Championship from TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, took advantage of its prime time slot on the east coast to increase its rating slightly from 2019 to 3.3, with 5.1 million viewers. The ESPN early coverage of the final round was up 60 percent from last year and was the most-viewed coverage of a final round on cable since 2010.\n\nESPN's coverage for all four rounds was up 35 percent for the 18-49 age group and up 76 percent for the 18-34 age group.\n\nThe news wasn't so good for the two major championships that were moved to the fall. The final-round U.S. Open rating of 2.0 was the lowest since 1987 and the Masters final-round rating of 3.4 was the lowest since 1995.\n\nHowever, those two tournaments were going head-to-head against college football and the NFL. Oddly enough, the ESPN College GameDay show from Augusta National on Nov. 14 was its highest-rated show of the season.\n\nA younger demographic also found new ways to consume golf. Streaming, digital and social media engagements for the PGA Tour were up 52 percent, according to Tour figures, streaming subscriptions to PGA Tour Live were up 68 percent, and the average user watched nearly an hour longer than prior to the shutdown.\n\nThe average weekly PGA Tour app and website visits were up 28 percent and the average weekly PGA Tour social media engagements were up 68 percent.\n\nThe PGA Tour also forged marketing agreements with gambling and fantasy sports web sites to provide ShotLink data, further adding to its potential popularity with a younger age group.\n\nRecreational golfing participation is up\n\nRecreational golfers seemed to follow Jay Monahan's lead.\n\nSince almost all states allowed golf, even when other activities were shut down in the early months of the pandemic, participation obviously increased. Rounds for the year are projected to jump by nearly 50 million, according to the National Golf Foundation, the largest bump since Tiger Woods burst on the scene in 1997.\n\nThe big explosion came during the summer months. June rounds were up 14 percent over 2019, July was up 20 percent (the largest monthly single increase since 2000) and August rounds increased 21 percent.\n\nWith more play came more money spent on equipment and apparel. Equipment sales in July were nearly $389 million, the highest single-month total reported by Golf Datatech, and retail sales in August were $331 million, up 32 percent over last year.\n\nGolf is one of the few sports where participation can drive interest in the professional game. The NBA, for example, isn't dependent on how many YMCA basketball leagues are in existence and the popularity of the NFL isn't driven by flag football leagues.\n\n\"People can get the golf bug either by watching it first or playing it first,\" Knapp said. \"But eventually they want both experiences, which makes this sport unique. We've been able to cultivate new fans both ways during the pandemic.\"\n\nDave Reese, the executive director of Florida's First Coast of Golf, said the sport's allure is that 20-handicappers can watch the game's stays play courses such as the TPC Sawgrass Players Stadium, then have the same experience.\n\nYankees fans can't step into the box at Yankee Stadium. Green Bay Packers fans can't take snaps on Lambeau Field.\n\n\"That's the relationship golf fans have with the pro golf that doesn't exist in any other sport,\" Reese said. \"Now, those of us in the golf industry need to take this as an opportunity, and keep new fans engaged.\"\n\nLooking ahead to The Players Championship in 2021\n\nThe first round of the 2020 Players Championship was the last time fans could come to a PGA Tour event with no restrictions on numbers, no face coverings and no social distancing.\n\nDespite the fact that vaccines are imminent, it's likely too optimistic to think the skyrocketing COVID-19 numbers of the past month will diminish enough by March for a normal Players Championship experience at the TPC Sawgrass.\n\nMonahan said the Tour is \"examining a variety of options,\" in terms of corporate hospitality and fan attendance at The Players.\n\n\"The landscape of the 2021 Players will look different than what we've all become accustomed to,\" said executive director Jared Rice. \"Whatever we're able to do, we'll be focused on the health and safety of players, caddies, volunteers, tournament staff and the fans as the No. 1 priority.\"\n\nRice said no final decisions have been made on corporate hospitality or the number of tickets that will be sold. Hopes are that tickets will go on sale in mid-January.\n\nThe good news is that the day The Players was canceled, the PGA Tour staff began working on the health and safety protocols that enabled the Tour to begin playing again in June. Rice and his staff have nine months of data and best practices to implement at The Players.\n\nRice, among everyone else at the Tour, is daring to dream that normalcy will return within the next year.\n\n\"The Tour was able to complete 26 events since the restart and has developed health and safety plans to successfully deliver those events for our players and title sponsors,\" he said. \"We've brought back pro-ams and we were able to have 2,500 fans per day in Houston. Things are getting hectic now as we plan for next year's Players ... we still have a lot to plan for. But what's really exciting is that it feels like we're close to turning a page.\"\n\nMonahan said the adversity the PGA Tour has faced and overcome since the aborted Players Championship in March could be, in retrospect, one of the organizations' finest hours.\n\n\"We're very proud of our players, caddies, staff and volunteers,\" he said. \"We have a lot of work left to do until everything is back to normal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/19/cicadas-1996-17-years/2194101/", "title": "10 things these cicadas have missed since 1996", "text": "Katharine Lackey\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCicadas are slowly emerging along the East Coast, crawling out from the earth after 17 years underground.\n\nExperts don't know exactly how many of the 1-inch bugs will be invading the states from North Carolina to Connecticut, but 30 billion seems like a good estimate.\n\nThe bugs in this year's batch, labeled brood II, have basically been living under a rock since 1996. Here's a look at 10 things they've missed:\n\n1. Social media. The cicadas crawling out of the ground may be surprised to find photos of themselves all over Twitter and Facebook as smartphones have made it easier than ever to share with friends, family and, well, everyone else in the world. Photos of the red-eyed buggers are already popping up on social-media sites and making their way into the news. Now, the question is whether our buggy little pals will join Facebook and try to friend us or post their selfies to Instagram.\n\n2. O.J. Simpson. The insects emerging in the past week may be a little confused to see O.J. Simpson back in court. Wasn't he acquitted in the \"trial of the century\" in 1995 for the slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a friend, Ron Goldman? Well, yes, but he was arrested, convicted and sentenced to nine to 33 years in prison for armed robbery and kidnapping of sports memorabilia dealers during a bizarre and disputed confrontation in 2007. Simpson once again took the stand this week, this time in a long-shot bid to win a new trial.\n\n3. Internet. If the insects buzz on over to the Drudge Report, they might wonder for a moment why the Internet hasn't changed much since 1996. But a quick look elsewhere, including at USA TODAY's redesigned website (shameless plug, I know), will show a vastly different interwebs, as we youngsters call it, than they used to know. Of course, the explosion of cat photos, videos and BuzzFeed articles on our feline friends may also lead them to believe that Al Gore sold the Internet to cats.\n\nOne thing the bugs won't be happy about: the ease at which users can find recipes online for cicada delicacies and concoctions. Cicada tacos, anyone?\n\n4. Reality TV. Cicadas hooked on The Real World may be surprised to find the show is still running, now in its 28th season on MTV. And since 1996, the reality TV scene has exploded, and the bugs will find a wide variety of programs they can feast on from Dancing With the Stars and American Idol to Keeping up with the Kardashians and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.\n\nAs some reality shows, such as American Idol and The Bachelor, have seen their ratings decline, the bugs have got to wonder: Will these shows still be around when their kids emerge from the ground in 2030?\n\n5. Baseball. Among the die-hard Red Sox fans, brood II's insects may be surprised to find the Boston team finally broke the Curse of the Bambino, not once but twice, while they were underground in 2004 and 2007. But not all teams have been as lucky: The Chicago Cubs are still without a World Series win since 1908.\n\nSpeaking of the Cubs, the cicada fans of Chicago's Sammy Sosa and the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire may be dismayed when they find out that not only did they miss the sluggers' infamous duel for the home run record in 1998 (McGwire won with 70 homers that season), but the two baseball superstars have been tainted amid suspicions their accomplishments were boosted by performance-enhancing drugs. In 2010, McGwire admitted to using steroids off and on during his career, including when he broke baseball's home run record. In 2009, The New York Times reported that Sosa was among those who tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug in MLB's 2003 anonymous survey. (Three years after McGwire set his record, it was stretched to 73 home runs by the San Francisco Giants' Barry Bonds, who also was tied to the PED scandal.)\n\nWhile the bugs missed Miguel Cabrera's Triple Crown win last year — the first MLB Triple Crown winner since 1967 — horse racing's Triple Crown remains elusive, with no horse winning all three races since Affirmed in 1978.\n\n6. Google. Back in 1996, the search engine was just a project called BackRub started by two computer-science grad students at Stanford. Too bad the bugs weren't able to buy any stock before they went underground — the company didn't offer its initial public offering until 2004. What started out as an $85-per-share investment has now shot up to more than $900 per share.\n\n7. Lottery. Players across the nation were looking for a big payday this week as Powerball and Mega Millions competed for attention with two large jackpots. Two winning tickets were sold in Friday's $190 million Mega Million jackpot, and many likely awaited Saturday's Powerball drawing — with a $600 million top prize that could climb — with bated breath.\n\nWho knows, maybe some of this year's early cicadas were able to get in on the action and were surprised at how much the lotto scene has changed since 1996. Of the two big lotteries today — Powerball and Mega Millions — only Powerball was in existence 17 years ago. While Powerball's predecessor, Lotto* America, began in 1988, it wasn't until September 1996 that the first jackpot for The Big Game — a whopping $5 million — was awarded. The lottery was later renamed Mega Millions, and went on to set a record for the largest lottery prize ever of $656 million in March 2012.\n\n8. Space. Our 17-year visitors will find they missed a lot of celestial news, starting with one fewer planet in our solar system: Pluto was ousted in 2006 after being downgraded to a dwarf planet. Meanwhile, if the cicadas are looking for a new place to live, Mars has gained popularity, with 78,000 people applying to become colonists through a non-profit organization called Mars One. The group's goal is to land four people on Mars in 2023 to start a permanent colony, with more arriving every two years thereafter.\n\n\n\n9. Investing. While brood II's parents earned 15.9% a year on their investments in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and 13.7% annually on the Nasdaq 100 index, the kids emerging today may be a little disappointed in their portfolios. Their 17-year average annual returns were down to 7.3% in the S&P 500 and 6.2% on the Nasdaq.\n\nFortunately for Brood II, their retirement is just a few weeks away. And they experienced a bit less inflation over their 17 years than their parents did. Inflation has averaged 2.4% a year for the past 17 years, vs. 4.8% for 1979-1996.\n\n10. Tiger Woods. Just making his pro golf debut in 1996, Tiger Woods may have looked like he'd have a promising career, but it would have been hard to predict just how good. Today's cicadas would have missed his first PGA Tour win at the Las Vegas Invitational in October 1996, where he finished 27 under par. Today, Woods ranks as the top golfer in the world, with 78 PGA Tour victories to his name.\n\nStill harder to predict would have been the scandal that broke in 2009 after The National Enquirer published a story alleging Woods was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess. Just two days after the report, Tiger Woods crashed his Cadillac Escalade SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant while driving erratically outside his Florida home. The crash caused more than $3,200 in property damage. Two weeks after the accident, Woods posted a statement on his website admitting he had been unfaithful to his wife, Elin, and shocked the sports world by announcing he was taking an indefinite break from golf to try to mend his family life.\n\nAfter a few weeks up in the trees, this batch of cicadas will die off, but not before breeding and sending their offspring underground, from which they will emerge in 2030. Which makes us wonder: What in the world will the world look like then?\n\nFollow @KatharineLackey on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2020/09/25/arizona-was-once-climate-policy-leader-in-west-what-happened/5841376002/", "title": "Arizona was once a climate policy leader in the West. What ...", "text": "On Labor Day weekend in 2020, the campgrounds and trailer parks around the Grand Canyon were quiet. With excessive heat warnings throughout the country and restrictions in place to slow the spread of a deadly virus, the holiday weekend was different from years past. Still, a steady stream of RVers and campers rolled in and out of the campgrounds on the South Rim.\n\nBut those who had come to see one of the nation’s most treasured natural wonders were met with a hazy view. One morning, the other side of the Canyon was barely visible. The striking definition of ridges, the red and orange palettes the Canyon is known for had been flattened by a smoky, at times opaque, haze.\n\nSmoke from some of the largest and hottest wildfires in history in California, Oregon and Washington had blanketed the West, and even reached the East Coast.\n\nFor some, the haze was reminiscent of the 1990s, when the Grand Canyon had often been similarly obscured. Pollution from Los Angeles, vehicles, coal-fired power plants and controlled burns seriously impaired the view at the Canyon at least 75 days a year, dulling its colorful vistas into a muted, murky landscape.\n\nHaze in the Grand Canyon was a particular concern for Arizona, the Grand Canyon state. At the time, Arizona led efforts to address smog in the Canyon, initiating partnerships with other Western states and spurring federal policies that greatly improved both visibility at the Grand Canyon and air pollution across the country.\n\n“The Grand Canyon is like the canary in the coal mine,” said Roger Clark, a program director for the Grand Canyon Trust and an active member in the regional haze work from its earliest stages. “Visibility issues are an early warning sign of things going awry in the atmosphere.”\n\nBy the early 2000s, the partnership of Western states established out of the Grand Canyon haze work was tapped to address another phenomenon just entering mainstream consciousness: climate change.\n\nGrowing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the planet led Arizona to develop a comprehensive state climate action plan. Other states soon followed.\n\nToday, the effects of climate change on Arizona have become almost as evident as the smoke hanging over the canyon: dwindling snowpack and extreme drought are stretching Colorado River supplies thin, summer temperatures are getting hotter and increasing heat-related deaths, and more destructive wildfires are scorching landscapes and lives. Temperatures in Maricopa County alone have risen by nearly 2 degrees Celsius since record-keeping began in 1895.\n\nBut Arizona is not the leader it was 15 years ago when the state led the West on regional haze and then climate policy.\n\nCities have largely taken the lead on climate policies. In recent years, the governor and the Legislature have taken no cohesive action, enacting laws that prohibit mitigation efforts at a local level. One state law even prevents state agencies from monitoring greenhouse gases.\n\n“The state first and foremost needs to stand up and say that we have an issue with climate,” said Coral Evans, the mayor of Flagstaff, the first city in the state to declare a climate emergency. “That leadership needs to be there. We don't talk about climate change. Maybe a lot of people in leadership in our state don't have the lived experience that I have. I’m third generation. I grew up here. Things are definitely different.”\n\nPOLL: Most Arizonans want government to act on climate change\n\nA plan to act\n\nOn a hot day in August 2006, Steve Owens steeled himself before entering the governor’s office. As the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality, it was his job to brief then-Gov. Janet Napolitano on the state’s new climate action plan.\n\nHe and a coalition of dozens of stakeholders — businesspeople, scientists, environmentalists, energy experts, ranchers, river runners, auto industry executives — had worked for more than a year to develop a set of 49 policy recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Arizona.\n\nThat day, Owens expected to defend the economic viability of the plan. Instead, the governor asked why the goals — reduce emissions to 2000 levels by 2020 and 50% below 2000 levels by 2040 — weren't more aggressive.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Arizona emerged as a national leader in developing strategies to combat fossil fuel-driven climate change. A wave of Democratic governors who were concerned about the issue were elected across the West. Republican governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah were vocal about wanting to lead on climate and environment issues.\n\nThe momentum was a response to federal inaction: In 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, a landmark international treaty signed in 1997 that required nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. At the start of his second term, Bush passed numerous policies at the behest of polluting industries who didn’t want more regulation.\n\nBy 2005, the issue drew attention at a more local level. It turned out to be “a watershed year for states deciding it was time for them to step up on climate change,” said Patrick Cummins, senior policy advisor at Colorado State University’s Center for the New Energy Economy.\n\nThat year, Napolitano signed an executive order to create a state climate action plan, one of the first in the nation at a state level.\n\nIn the previous decade, Arizona had added fossil fuel pollutants to the atmosphere more than any other state. Between 1990 and 2005, Arizona’s emissions shot up a staggering 56%, a rate of increase three times the national average. The numbers gave Napolitano compelling reason to act.\n\n“It was a realization that climate was a really big deal and that we needed to have a plan, that we needed to put some intentionality into it,” Napolitano said in a recent interview. Napolitano recently resigned as the President of University of California to teach as a tenured professor at UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy.\n\n“It seemed to me that this was an area that Arizona needed to take up and also could be a leader in,” she said.\n\nA string of states followed: New Mexico, the Carolinas, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania all developed their own climate plans. Arizona dipped its toes into international climate collaboration, too: A few months after Napolitano’s executive order, Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora declared they would work together to address emissions in the borderlands.\n\n“This had been just something done by governors in the Northeast and the West Coast and not by the heartland. Arizona was the first southwestern state to do this and one of the first red states in the country, period,” said Thomas Peterson, President of the Center for Climate Strategies. The Washington D.C.-based non-profit has worked with more than 20 states across the US and with countries around the world to develop strategies to lower emissions and achieve economic goals.\n\nThe organization leads states to find a consensus on policies and prepared the emissions inventory, forecast, and economic impact analyses for Arizona’s 2006 plan.\n\n“Arizona demonstrated that a very diverse group of stakeholders could reach agreements on a substantial list of things to do to address emissions,” Peterson said.\n\nSeven northeastern states had already signed a memorandum to create the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the first mandatory market-based program in the US to reduce emissions. Launched in 2009, it continues to be lauded for showing that economic growth can coincide with emissions reductions.\n\nIn 2007, Arizona attempted to spearhead a similar regional approach. Governors of three West Coast states, along with Arizona and New Mexico, signed a memorandum of understanding directing their environmental agencies to design a market-based mechanism to achieve regional emissions goals, what was known as a cap-and-trade program. Republican strongholds Utah and Montana signed on to the program too and the Western Climate Initiative was born.\n\nIn developing the 2006 plan, Arizona found that the transportation and electricity sectors accounted for nearly 40% each of the state’s total emissions. Cities were in a long-running fight with bad air pollution. Passenger vehicles were then and remain a main driver of the state's ozone pollution.\n\nAt the time, Napolitano and ADEQ officials determined that adopting the more stringent California Clean Car standards was necessary, especially in light of Arizona’s rapid growth in both population and vehicle use. The tailpipe standards would not only lower planet-heating emissions, but also help the state meet the stricter ozone standards announced by the Bush Administration in 2008.\n\n“While this regulation alone will not substantially reduce or reverse ongoing global climate change, it is inconceivable that those reduction targets could be achieved without actors like the state of Arizona undertaking reductions like this,” ADEQ stated in its final rulemaking.\n\nMany major policy recommendations from the plan were adopted by other states, helping the US make a significant dent in its emissions over the years. In fact, state policies have had a greater impact than the Great Recession in lowering national emissions.\n\n“There was this period when there was this enormous wave of action,” said Peterson. “But the action didn't get fully implemented and there's all this unfinished business. And that is the failure.”\n\nCLIMATE DISCUSSION: Republic panel talks about threats, solutions\n\nMomentum breaks down\n\nThe Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora were on the verge of signing on to the Western Climate Initiative when the Great Recession hit. By the time the Initiative launched in 2012, Arizona had already pulled out of the cap-and-trade program.\n\nWhen Napolitano was appointed to serve in the Obama Administration as Secretary of Homeland Security in 2009, Republican Jan Brewer landed in the governor’s office. The recession, California’s growing regulatory environment, and President Barack Obama’s election rapidly transformed the state’s political landscape.\n\n“2009-10 was a time in Arizona dominated by optimism about solar energy, skepticism about ‘cap and trade,’ and concern about California and the federal government determining Arizona’s environmental and economic competitiveness,” Ben Grumbles, the ADEQ director appointed by Brewer after Owens left for the EPA, wrote in an emailed statement to The Republic.\n\nHe now serves as Maryland’s Secretary of Environment and is an officer for the regional carbon market program in the northeast.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2010, Brewer signed an executive order to pull Arizona from the Western Climate Initiative, saying the program would cripple the state’s economy. Two months later, she signed a law that prevented any state agencies from even monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. The law remains on the books today.\n\nIn a final blow to the momentum of the Napolitano era, Brewer signed an order that, in 2012, blocked the state from adopting California’s clean car standards. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry celebrated the repeal as vindication from California’s “overbearing regulatory environment.” Environmentalists decried the move.\n\n“Brewer and I had very different ideas about what Arizona needed and what good public policy was,” Napolitano said. “She focused on the immigration agenda almost to the exclusion, it seems, of everything else.”\n\nBrewer declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nBrewer’s signing of SB 1070, an anti-immigration law, plunged Arizona into political chaos and landed the state in the national spotlight. The rise of the Tea Party and increasing political polarization across the nation pushed climate change to the sidelines and made it increasingly a partisan issue.\n\nDuring the Bush years, John McCain had been the only Republican senator to push for climate change legislation, but after his electoral defeat in 2008, he reverted to the party line and played a large role in blocking any climate legislation from reaching the senate floor.\n\nSince that time, there has been no comprehensive climate action from the governor or the Legislature. With the Trump Administration’s repeal of Obama-era clean car standards, despite the EPA’s finding that the rollback could lead to an additional 444 to 1,000 premature deaths from increased air pollution, the federal government has created an even lower backstop for a state already struggling to mitigate bad air.\n\n“Arizona was really standing out because of all the things we were doing,” Owens recalled. “It’s disappointing, the things that could have been done in the last 10, 15 years. With drought conditions that still persist, the record heats we continue to have, the Colorado river drying up, you would think people would be more concerned. But the people who are in positions to do something about it are in complete denial.”\n\nEmissions and climate change today\n\nWhen Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans was a kid, she swam in the Rio de Flag every summer. The river flowed behind her grandfather’s house, its cool waters a welcome summer respite. By the time Halloween came around, winter had usually settled over the city. Sometimes the snow lasted through April.\n\nToday, Evans lives in the house her grandfather built in 1942, but the river behind it no longer flows like it used to. The heavy winters of Evans’ childhood are rarer. Ski resorts now spray manufactured snow onto the mountains to mark the beginning of ski season. The temperate summers Evans grew up with are warmer; every year, temperatures inch closer to reaching 100 degrees for the first time.\n\n“I have had the ability to experience firsthand the changes caused by this climate crisis we're experiencing,” said Evans, who is running for a seat in the state House as a Democrat. “The local impact of the climate crisis is devastating and is directly impacting our quality of life and our economy right now.”\n\nArizona’s carbon emissions aren’t as dire as the 2006 climate plan anticipated they would be. The plan predicted a whopping 148% increase in emissions by 2020 if Arizona failed to implement any of the recommended policies.\n\nJust before the Great Recession hit, Arizona had increased its emissions from 2000 levels by 20% . In 2008, the state spewed an all-time high of 102 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe recession, combined with improving technology over the years and utilities shifting to a more robust renewable energy portfolio, tempered the state’s emissions rate and led to a decrease in total emissions to 2000 levels by 2017, according to the US Energy Information Administration, the best state-level greenhouse gas emissions data in the absence of a state-run greenhouse gas inventory.\n\nStill, Arizona is falling behind in the West when it comes to proactive climate policy. In 2018, voters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada elected Democratic governors and legislatures. Soon after, Colorado joined California’s clean car standards. New Mexico and Nevada are moving to do the same. Earlier this year, a climate report ordered by the Utah Legislature developed a roadmap for tackling climate change and pollution.\n\nWhile climate change is a global problem, some of the most innovative and effective solutions in addressing emissions have come from the state and regional levels, and have even incentivized stronger action from the federal government.\n\n“It makes a national program more inevitable when enough states are doing it, so state action and state leadership is going to continue to be important,” said Cummins. “But ultimately when you look at what the scientists are telling us about cutting emissions in half by 2030, getting to net zero by 2050—this requires a national mobilization.”\n\nLocal efforts, state sabotage\n\nArizona’s cities and counties have taken the lead on climate action in the absence of state and national leadership. Flagstaff, Phoenix, and Pima County all conduct their own regular greenhouse gas emissions inventories. Maricopa County published its first inventory this year. Flagstaff, Phoenix, Tempe, and Tucson have either already implemented or are in the process of developing their own climate action plans. Over the years, the cities have enacted innovative policies to reduce their respective carbon footprints.\n\n“Phoenix is home to 1.7 million people, so we are larger than 10 states,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego in a recent interview. “Cities are the branch of government that are closest to our residents. We hear what they need and what they want. If we lead, it really can make a difference. I would love to see the Legislature give us more tools to be able to respond to our residents rather than restrict our ability.”\n\nIn recent years, the Legislature has passed multiple bills that hinder climate action on a local level. In 2014, the Legislature outlawed plastic bag bans in cities and towns. In 2015, the Legislature prohibited cities from requiring energy benchmarking for commercial buildings, a move that Tempe council member Lauren Kuby called a “slap-in-the face to local decision making.”\n\nThis year, in what many called a reflex response to California policies, a state law was fast-tracked through the Legislature and signed by the governor in February to prevent Arizona’s cities and towns from banning natural gas or other fossil fuels in buildings.\n\n“The Legislature has the potential to be a driving force to create an equitable approach to water insecurity and extreme heat,” Kuby wrote in response to emailed questions from The Republic.\n\n“Arizonans, as well as cities, businesses, and nonprofits are way ahead of the AZ Corporation Commission, Legislature, and the Governor in thinking and acting proactively to address the climate emergency,\" she said. \"Extremists in the Legislature are not only content to do nothing, they attempt to squash cities that are innovating to address the climate crisis.”\n\nIn recent years, the Arizona Corporation Commission repealed rooftop solar incentives. Though the state’s major utilities have announced fairly ambitious clean energy goals, the commission has not increased its renewable-energy and energy-efficiency standards since the mid-2000s.\n\nSome lawmakers have attempted to push legislation to require action at a state level. In this last Legislative session, Democrats Kirsten Engel and Juan Mendez introduced bills in the House and Senate respectively to develop a state climate action plan and greenhouse gas inventory. The bills died before ever reaching the Senate floor.\n\n“Fundamentally, we need a state Sustainability Commission and an Arizona Office of Sustainability,” Kuby wrote. “If the State of Florida can dedicate an office to incubating policies that mitigate or adapt to climate change, then Arizona, with a history of coming together on contentious water issues, should be able to agree that we need coordinated sustainability policy at the state level.”\n\nIt was only last year that Governor Doug Ducey publicly acknowledged climate change was influenced by human activity. In the past several years, Ducey has taken some action on environmental issues plaguing the state, particularly water issues. In January 2019 he signed an executive order to create a council to address long-term concerns about a drier future in Arizona beyond the issues involving the Colorado River.\n\n“Governor Ducey believes we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and that doing so is tied to our economy and quality of life,” a spokesperson for the governor wrote in an email to The Republic. “At the same time, we are mindful of how any proposed policies impact our economy, taxpayers, small businesses, everyday Arizonans and energy costs. ADEQ is an entire state agency devoted 365 days a year to protecting our environment and our air and water.”\n\nThe governor declined to be interviewed for this story and didn’t respond to specific questions from The Republic.\n\nEvery year, ADEQ spends millions of dollars on a variety of travel reduction, vehicle efficiency and lawn equipment replacement initiatives to improve emissions. But the agency has no authority to address carbon dioxide emissions, one of the main greenhouse gases.\n\nADEQ spokesperson Caroline Oppleman pointed to partnerships with utilities, the private sector, and advancements like evolving electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell technology as ways Arizona will lower its carbon footprint in coming years.\n\nThe market-driven shift from coal dominance will also improve emissions, Oppleman said. The closure of the Navajo Generating Station in November 2019 alone reduced Arizona’s emissions by 13.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to ADEQ. Roughly a third of Arizona's energy production is already from non-fossil fuel alternative sources, including Palo Verde nuclear generating station, said Oppleman.\n\n“Our goal with all these efforts has been to take the politics out of it, and focus on good policies that are bipartisan and good for the state of Arizona,” Ducey’s spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe reliance on the federal government and natural market swings will have positive impacts, but those actively working toward solutions say waiting on the market isn’t enough.\n\n“We're implementing climate policy by implementing utility energy policy and transportation policy,” said Jeff Schlegel, a member of the 2006 climate action plan working group and a state energy policy consultant. “The prospects for the Commission improving the energy rules and in so doing, making progress on climate change is probably the best thing that we have going right now.”\n\nOn the transportation side, Schlegel said, a combination of the market and EPA requirements for ozone standards, and other air quality issues in the Valley will also help improve emissions policies.\n\n“It's just a matter of whether you have it three to five years earlier because of some good policy,” Schlegel said. “But not only is the Legislature not taking positive action to address the crisis, they're preventing local municipalities from taking their own action, which is bizarre coming from a political party that claims it is in favor of local control.”\n\nSTUDY: Phoenix will feel more extreme heat as climate changes\n\nTime to act\n\nTime is running out. In 2018, the world’s leading climate scientists warned the world had to take drastic action within 12 years to slow the rate of global warming and keep it at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond that, every degree has increasingly dire consequences.\n\nThe world has already warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution and is on track to reach 3 degrees of warming by the end of the century if major reductions in emissions aren’t achieved.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement, an international treaty to lower greenhouse gas emissions hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. In 2017, the Trump Administration announced the U.S., one of the largest emitters of planet-heating emissions in the world, would no longer participate in the agreement.\n\nFor all living organisms, the faster climate changes, the more difficult it is to adapt to it. When climate change is too rapid, as it has become with the help of human-caused emissions, species start going extinct.\n\nCoral reefs would largely die off with two degrees of warming. Three degrees could result in the loss of many coastal cities. Four degrees could reduce the flow of the Colorado River to a trickle. Five degrees could leave huge swathes of the planet uninhabitable.\n\nThere will also be economic impacts. A 2017 study found the U.S. could lose 2.3% of its GDP for each degree Celsius increase in global warming.\n\nThe Southwest, already the hottest and driest region in the United States, is warming at a faster rate than other parts of the country. Maricopa County's average temperature has increased by 1.9 degrees since 1895. This gradual climate change means longer, hotter summers, experts say, as the monsoon pattern arrives later.\n\nStates can have tremendous power to make a difference, especially in the U.S., which is second only to China in its contribution to planet-heating emissions.\n\n“The states need to be taking the initiative on this because the federal government right now certainly isn't,” said Owens, the former ADEQ director. “While an individual state can only do so much, it's extremely important for an individual state to do as much as it can.”\n\nPolitical polarization in the last decade has made large-scale action difficult, but many see bipartisan consensus as the only way forward.\n\n“The state of Arizona and the federal government can’t continue ignoring this issue,” said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero in a phone interview. “We are at a point where it’s all hands on deck. Democrats, Republicans, the business community, elected officials, students and scientists can work together to plan for the future, invest in green, renewable infrastructure that creates jobs. It is an economic opportunity for us and at the same time, we will be doing something good for our environment.”\n\nIn September, Tucson formally declared a climate emergency and will implement a decade-long plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nThe need to remove politics from the climate conversation is something many from both sides of the aisle agree needs to happen. This year, representatives from Arizona’s utilities, business community, and political leaders met in a forum to discuss the state’s direction on energy.\n\n“The consensus was clear: the value of diversifying our energy portfolio and expanding our utilization of renewable energy options is not a left or right question, but an imperative that will have significant impacts on our state,” Jaime Molera, a Republican and former state official, and Glenn Hamer, the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, wrote in a joint op-ed in The Arizona Capitol Times in February.\n\nDiscourse may be the first step, but the science shows the window for meaningful action is rapidly closing.\n\n\"Climate is the great convener. Our livelihoods and environment should not be partisan,\" said Kuby. \"We need to elect people who are not beholden to corporate interests, who reflect the people and the science that we are in a climate crisis and must take action.”\n\nErin Stone covers the environment for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

She is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Soon, parents across the country may finally have the option to vaccinate their young kids against Covid-19. Pfizer and BioNTech announced Tuesday they are requesting emergency use authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years, signaling the potential arrival of a vaccine for this age group in the weeks to come, pending review of the safety and efficacy data.\n\nWhat feels to many parents like long-awaited news has others thinking long and hard about the choice ahead of them. Currently, only three in 10 parents say they'll get their child under the age of 5 vaccinated as soon as possible when a Covid-19 vaccine is authorized, according to the most recent data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I find this response disheartening. As a new mom to a beautiful boy who will be 6 months this March, I understand this parental concern. I have come to accept that worrying is part of being a parent, and despite being well versed in the science, I too have paused to ask myself whether I'm ready to give my baby the Covid-19 vaccine. My most important job as a mama is, after all, keeping him safe.\n\nKnowing then, that some of us may be torn by the choice ahead of us, but that all of us want to keep our children safe, I want to share with you a few of the things that are bringing me comfort as the Covid-19 vaccine for young children makes its way through the regulatory process.\n\nThe context of childhood vaccinations\n\nFew things in this world are inspected and monitored as closely as childhood vaccinations, and for good reason. Vaccines, unlike drugs to treat illnesses, are given to healthy children in order to keep them healthy. Because of this, the standard for safety and efficacy that vaccines must clear for approval is incredibly high.\n\nWhen it comes to the Covid-19 vaccines specifically, we have had so much collective experience with their safety and efficacy. To date, over 317 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been given in the United States alone and the vast majority have been tolerated with no significant problems.\n\nI have also found it helpful to remember that following vaccination, immunity lasts in the body but the vaccine itself does not. Many parents have shared with me their concerns about the long-term effects of the vaccine on their kids' development, future fertility and growth. I often explain the vaccine is a type of brief message to tell the body to make the protection against the virus, and once received and acted upon, the body destroys the message.\n\nThe process of approval for vaccines\n\nIn what can at times be an overwhelming stream of news, it can be hard to keep track of just how thorough the vaccine review and approval process is in this country.\n\nBefore a pharmaceutical company can receive emergency use authorization for a vaccine, trial participants are observed for an average of two months. I find this wait requirement particularly reassuring. In decades past, when a vaccine was found to cause a rare but potentially serious side effect, it occurred within the six-week period following vaccination . The two-month average wait period is therefore a way to ensure these potential side effects have had enough time to manifest themselves before the regulators even examine the data.\n\nOnce the data is submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, it is reviewed by the agency's independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and, if appropriate, the vaccine is given EUA. From there it goes to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where yet another group of independent experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), examine it and make recommendations about how the vaccine should be administered to the American public. Typically, the CDC director will accept the committee's recommendation.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBehind the long names and acronyms, these committees are made up of some of the most brilliant scientific minds of our time, which gives me yet another reason to believe in the process.\n\nThe vaccinations children routinely receive have all been through this process over the years and have been shown to be safe and effective. This has until now led me to vaccinate my son as soon as he has been eligible against illnesses like hepatitis B, diphtheria, polio, whooping cough and others. As the Covid-19 vaccine makes its way through the regulatory process in the coming weeks, I hope to be able to tune out the noise, to set aside any anxiety and, with as clear a mind as a new mom can have, know that the FDA and CDC recommendations will be grounded in facts and made by those who have worked diligently for decades to protect our kids from potentially serious and at times deadly illnesses.

The tribe unveiled a compact proposal that includes exclusivity, table games and two new north casino sites. The state would also receive a negotiated share of the revenue. Poarch Tribal Chair Stephanie Bryan said the state has perpetual budget shortfalls, and the revenue could fill needs in education and other areas. The tribe projected it could boost state revenue by $1 billion including taxes and license fees. The proposal also includes a lottery. Dog tracks have long fought any proposal to give the tribe a monopoly. A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey says Ivey is open to recommendations, but it’s ultimately a question for legislators.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: It appears increasingly less likely that a special session of the Legislature will be held this year to address the check paid to residents from the state’s oil-wealth fund, Gov. Mike Dunleavy says. In August, Dunleavy accepted the dividend passed by lawmakers, which amounted to $1,606, but said he viewed it as partial payment and anticipated a fall special session to address the issue. Under state law, at least 30 days’ notice is needed to hold a non-emergency special session during the interim. That would push any special session now up against the holidays. The Republican governor has pushed for a dividend in line with a long-standing calculation that hasn’t been followed since 2016. Many lawmakers said such a dividend is unaffordable.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildlife officials say an endangered squirrel subspecies in southeastern Arizona is fighting its way back after much of its mountain habitat was burned by a 2017 wildfire. The state Game and Fish Department says the Mount Graham red squirrel’s population is stabilizing, with a 4% increase recorded in September during an annual survey that produced an estimate of 78 squirrels, up from 75 in 2018. According to the department, the population peaked at about 550 in the late 1990s. Before the 2017 wildfire, the population ranged between 200 and 300. Terrestrial wildlife specialist Tim Snow says the results are encouraging, though much work remains to help protect the squirrel population. The squirrel is found only in upper-elevation conifer forests of the Pinaleño Mountains.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The head of the city’s teachers union says another strike – or other actions – protesting state takeover of the local school district and the loss of collective bargaining rights is possible. Little Rock Education Association President Teresa Knapp Gordon spoke Friday, a day after hundreds of teachers in the system walked out for the first time in decades. Gordon called Thursday’s one-day strike in the 23,000-student district a success, saying it drew attention to the teachers’ call for a return to full local control of schools. Arkansas has run the Little Rock district since 2015, when it was taken over because of low test scores at several schools. Schools remained open during the strike, though the district said several hundred teachers and more than half the students were absent Thursday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Author Maya Angelou and performer RuPaul are among the inductees for the next class of the California Hall of Fame. The class includes soccer player and two-time World Cup champion Brandi Chastain, skateboarder and entrepreneur Tony Hawk, actor and comedian George Lopez, chef and restaurateur Wolfgang Puck, astrophysicist France A. Cordova, author Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, civil rights leader James M. Lawson Jr. and winemaker Helen M. Turley. The class will be inducted during a ceremony Dec. 10, though Angelou died in 2014. The California Hall of Fame started in 2006, and inductees are selected each year by the governor and first partner. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who announced the inductees, says they “embody California’s innovative spirit.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Vail residents fighting to protect habitat for a beleaguered herd of bighorn sheep as developers push to build housing for resort workers have taken their case to state court, The Denver Post reports. A lawsuit filed last week in Eagle County District Court contends Vail town officials violated local rules when they approved a Triumph Development project to build high-density worker housing along Interstate 70 where the bighorns forage during winter. The battle pits the mountain resort’s economic demands against the needs of wildlife, in this case Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, the state animal. The Colorado bighorn population has dwindled to about 6,800, down from about 7,600 in 2012 and 8,000 in 2001, state data shows. Vail Valley bighorns have decreased to about 5% of their historic numbers.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two new plans to improve the state’s transportation system include proposals to quicken commutes to and from New York City. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont says it’s important for Connecticut to improve life for commuters, noting the Big Apple is the “global capital of the world,” and Connecticut is part of that metropolitan center. His 10-year, $21.3 billion transportation plan invests $6.2 billion in rail improvements, including new cars and locomotives. The state Senate Republican plan proposes a new Connecticut/New York Railroad Strategy Board to vet rail projects. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says his state has been investing in Metro-North Railroad, which has a contract with Connecticut to operate the New Haven Line.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Twenty-two of Delaware’s 30 highest-paid state workers are men, according to salary figures from the Office and Management and Budget as of August. Of the top 10 paid men in 2019, nine earn a regular salary that tops $200,000 per year. That doesn’t include any extra pay such as stipends, benefits or overtime. Four of the top 10 paid women make that much, and the highest-paid female state worker makes less than the top three male workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. will have to say one of its hardest goodbyes Tuesday, to beloved panda Bei Bei, WUSA-TV reports. The 4-year-old panda will leave the Smithsonian National Zoo for China as part of the panda diplomacy program between the U.S and China. An agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association requires all cubs born at the zoo to move to China when they turn 4. Bei Bei will play in his outside habitat for the last time Tuesday, between 7 and 8 a.m., before he makes his way to Dulles Airport for a long flight. To give his many adoring fans time to bid Bei Bei farewell, the Smithsonian National Zoo has been hosting a series of public events, including postcard writing and friendship bracelet making. Panda Cam 1 is focused exclusively on Bei Bei for the duration of his “goodbye week.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Legal skirmishes over elections were fought on two fronts Friday, as a pair of federal court cases underscored the crucial role the state could play in next year’s election. Republicans and Democrats are battling over the order of names on ballots and who is eligible to vote. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis filed an appeal Friday in a bid to lift a federal judge’s temporary order allowing some felons to regain voting rights despite failing to settle unpaid fines and other legal debts. DeSantis also said he would appeal a ruling handed down by another federal judge who sided with Democrats on name order on ballots. Judge Mark Walker agreed that a candidate whose name appears first has an undue advantage. Noting Florida’s history of close elections, he said that “systematically allocating that small but statistically significant advantage” would be constitutionally unfair. Under current law, top ballot billing goes to the governor’s party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s ethics commission has filed a lawsuit seeking communications between Democrat Stacey Abrams’ unsuccessful 2018 campaign for governor and several third-party organizations. But Abrams’ former campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo says they’ve already turned over thousands of financial records and calls the investigation politically motivated. The Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission filed the motion in Fulton County Superior Court on Friday. It’s part of an investigation accusing the Abrams campaign of “unlawful coordination” with an outside organization. The commission says the campaign isn’t complying with subpoenas issued last spring. Abrams narrowly lost to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last year. Ethics commission chief David Emadi is a former county prosecutor who had donated to Kemp’s campaign.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: After conducting an aerial survey of the island forest, officials have discovered an ohia tree-killing fungal disease local to the state is spreading on Oahu. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports state Division of Forestry and Wildlife officials tagged 41 more trees that could be ailing from rapid ohia death after first discovering an infected tree July 31. Wildlife officials say the latest confirmed tree is infected with Ceratocystis huliohia, the less aggressive fungal pathogen of two types associated with the disease. Officials say this form is known to take months to years to kill ohia trees. Officials say the more aggressive form has been discovered on Kauai and is responsible for wiping out 80% of the trees destroyed by rapid ohia death on the Big Island.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The State Board of Health and Welfare has removed a controversial rule requiring transgender minors to get a doctor’s approval before changing the gender listed on their birth certificate. The Idaho Press reports after a closed-door executive session with attorneys on Thursday, board chairman Darrell Kerby announced the rule was being vacated because it didn’t have enough votes when it was approved last spring. At that time, three board members voted “yes,” one voted “no,” and one person abstained. Kerby says that fell short of the four affirmative votes required to put the rule into effect. In 2018 a federal judge ruled that Idaho violated the constitutional rights of two transgender women who were denied permission to change the gender on their birth certificates to match their identity. Idaho complied with the court order, but the Board of Health and Welfare created the rule requiring a doctor’s sign-off for minors a short time later.\n\nIllinois\n\nO’Fallon: A $10 million pedestrian trail connecting two southwest Illinois counties has opened after 15 years of planning. The extension of the Madison County Transit Goshen Trail runs 7 miles connecting Troy in Madison County to O’Fallon in St. Clair County. The new trail is about 10 feet wide. Organizers have estimated roughly 115,000 people will use it every year, including cyclists and joggers. The initial idea came in 2003. It took time to secure ownership of properties. Funding was split among several entities, including the state, counties, a park district and the city of O’Fallon. Roughly 150 people attended the ribbon cutting Saturday. At the opening, Madison County Transit Managing Director Jerry Kane jokingly referred to it as the “It’s Finally Open Trail.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Christmas came early at the Indianapolis Zoo last week. The two walruses at the zoo, Pakak and Aurora, were shipped off to new homes: Aurora to SeaWorld Orlando to breed, and Pakak to the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma, Washington, to be reunited with the walrus with whom he was rescued. After saying goodbye, the Indianapolis Zoo welcomed 2-year-old walruses Aku and Ginger to the Oceans area. Aku is an 841-pound male who lost his right eye shortly after being rescued. Ginger is a 711-pound female who is very fond of Aku. Indianapolis Zoo public relations specialist Carla Knapp says the zoo is very hopeful the two walruses will eventually breed. According to a release, walruses are vulnerable to extinction, and there are only 14 in human care across four zoos and aquariums in the United States. Climate change and melting ice have resulted in fewer habitats for walruses.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Organizers of a new statewide bicycle ride are changing the date of their planned event so it doesn’t conflict with an annual ride that dates to the 1970s. Organizers of Iowa’s Ride announced Friday on the group’s Facebook page that the ride would be held July 12-18, a week earlier than previously planned. The change means the ride won’t overlap with the Des Moines Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or RAGBRAI, scheduled for July 19-25. Iowa’s Ride also will move from east to west, while RAGBRAI traditionally travels west to east. The former director of RAGBRAI and his staff resigned and launched the rival event amid a backlash over the Register’s handling of a story involving fundraiser Carson King.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The city has joined a community coalition to memorialize the lynching of three black men near downtown in 1882. The Lawrence chapter of the NAACP is working with the Equal Justice Initiative to erect a historical marker with information about the lynching, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. The city commission recently voted unanimously to become a member of the Community Remembrance Coalition. Mayor Lisa Larsen says she thinks joining the coalition signifies that the city supports the NAACP’s efforts. NAACP chapter President Ursula Minor wrote in a letter to Larsen that the purpose of the coalition is to build awareness and enable truthful conversations about the legacy of racial terrorism and injustice through the historical marker project. The Lawrence NAACP has been working on the project for several months.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The Kentucky Folklife Program at Western Kentucky University is looking for proposals for articles and other pieces documenting the state’s folklife. The program said in a news release that this is the first call for proposals for the multimedia digital publication and said the magazine “explores the diversity of expressive cultures within Kentucky.” In addition to articles, the magazine is looking for ideas for photo essays, documentary film and audio, interviews, and oral histories and performances. Proposals of about 200 to 400 words can be submitted to kyfolklife@wku.edu with the subject heading “Kentucky Folklife Magazine Proposal.” Published features receive a contributor’s honorarium.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The governor says the state’s fishing industry has been hit with $258 million in losses due to historic flooding this year. In a news release, Gov. John Bel Edwards says the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries conducted an economic impact analysis to determine the flooding impacts. The analysis was submitted to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help the state qualify for part of the fisheries disaster assistance. Edwards also asked the state’s congressional delegation for help in a letter Friday. According to the analysis, the private lease oyster industry was the hardest hit with $121 million in losses. Heavy rains in the Midwest kept the Mississippi River at flood stage for extended periods of time and forced the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway two times.\n\nMaine\n\nScarborough: A Maine-based supermarket chain says it’s launching a new initiative to tackle hunger and food insecurity in children, starting with a $1 million donation. Hannaford Supermarkets says it’s calling the project “Fuel Kids at School.” The company says it will work with hunger relief groups to establish 90 school food pantries in Maine and other states in the Northeast. Hannaford says it expects the effort to take two years. Company President Mike Vail says the goal of the effort is for “access to food to be easy for kids.” The company says the pantries will be located inside schools and will allow students to choose foods they can eat during and after the school day.\n\nMaryland\n\nBel Air: Police have arrested a bank teller accused of breaking into the home of a customer who had recently withdrawn a large sum of money. The Harford County Sheriff’s Office said in a release that 19-year-old Nathan Michael Newell assaulted a 78-year-old man and his stepdaughter Monday night inside a Bel Air home. He got away but was arrested at the bank Wednesday. Freedom Federal Credit Union president and CEO Michael MacPherson told The Baltimore Sun that Newell has been fired. Charging documents say Newell confessed to the crime and said he did it because he was tired of working two jobs. Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler told WJZ-TV it was “almost like a reverse bank robbery,” and he hadn’t seen anything like it in 34 years in law enforcement.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s cranberry growers are getting assistance to help overhaul their bogs. Gov. Charlie Baker’s administration says 21 growers have received a total of nearly $1 million for bog renovation projects. The new grant program is meant to help growers reduce their environmental impact while making their bogs more efficient and productive. Farmers are receiving state grants to reconfigure bogs, improve irrigation systems and plant higher-yield cranberry varieties. Baker says the effort comes from a 2016 recommendation from the state’s Cranberry Revitalization Task Force. The price of cranberries has plummeted 57% over the past decade as the industry struggles with overproduction and weakening demand for cranberry juice. Massachusetts is the nation’s second-largest cranberry growing region after Wisconsin. It has 363 farms on more than 13,555 acres.\n\nMichigan\n\nLeland: A late 19th-century shipwreck has been discovered in northern Lake Michigan. MLive reports the discovery of W.C. Kimball was announced last week with photos and videos documenting the details on social media. Shipwreck hunter Ross Richardson, technical diver Steve Wimer and a group of other wreck enthusiasts documented its position in May. Richardson initially found it more than a year ago on his boat’s sonar screen. He was passing through the lake when he noticed a small blip. At first, there was speculation the Kimball was run over by a larger ship. But the condition of the boat has ruled out that claim. The ship was lost in an 1891 storm with four people aboard. Richardson’s website account notes that it was set to round the Leelanau Peninsula.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The president of Macalester College is asking his board of trustees to remove the school founder’s name from a campus building over concerns about his racist and sexist views in the 1800s. The Star Tribune reports that Brian Rosenberg, leader of the private liberal arts college, told faculty last week that he planned to strip Edward Duffield Neill’s name from the humanities building, following pressure from student activists and journalists. Neill Hall was chosen in 2013. Rosenberg said in a statement to the newspaper that his recommendation “is based on the racism reflected in his historical writings, which are extreme even by the standards of his time.” The decision came two weeks after the student publication Mac Weekly published a special issue citing numerous examples of derogatory comments Neill made about American Indians in his published writings.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The governor has announced more than $53 million in projects to help coastal communities recover from the 2010 BP oil spill. Money for the 15 projects is coming from civil and criminal penalties resulting from the spill. They include $8 million to find and counter sources of coastal water pollution and $7 million to restore and create wetlands with dredged silt. Projects totaling at least $10 million are aimed at economic recovery. Those include $3 million each to improve the Interstate 10 commercial corridor in Moss Point, to help build an information systems job training center at a community college and to improve a public marina in Biloxi. Nearly $6 million would continue assessing reef fish in coastal and nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says he has “absolutely zero regrets” over the decision to move two research agencies’ headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City. Perdue joined government leaders from Kansas and Missouri on Friday to tour the new headquarters for the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Critics say the move will harm agriculture research and make the findings less accessible to federal policymakers. Perdue contends moving the agencies to the heart of agriculture country will allow researchers to work more closely with farmers, land grant universities and private agriculture-related companies. But Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist and union representative at the Economic Research Service, said the agencies’ researchers focus on national questions, and living near agricultural land is irrelevant to the work they do.\n\nMontana\n\nTroy: A moose tested positive for chronic wasting disease, marking the first time the disease has been detected in the species in the state. A hunter harvested the bull moose in late October near Pulpit Mountain west of Quartz Creek and north of Troy. The harvest occurred less than half a mile to the west of the existing Libby CWD Management Zone. CWD is a fatal disease that can affect the nervous system of mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk and moose. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks collected the voluntary sample from the moose and submitted it for testing to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. The lab identified it to be suspected of CWD infection and confirmed the positive detection with a second test.\n\nNebraska\n\nValentine: The state Transportation Department is reporting progress in restoring traffic on floodwater-covered highways in the Sandhills region. The department said Thursday that normal, two-lane traffic is returning to U.S. Highway 83 between Thedford and Valentine, and one lane of traffic has been restored on Nebraska Highway 97 south of Merritt Reservoir. The department also says it plans to raise a portion of the roadbed this week on Nebraska Highway 61 between Hyannis and Merriman. Unusually high rainfall since spring flooded Sandhills marshes and ponds, resulting in floodwaters covering nearby highways and county roads.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Nineteen unvaccinated students were forced to temporarily unenroll from a local high school to avoid exposure during an outbreak of whooping cough. Unenrolling during the disease’s 21-day incubation period allows the Damonte Ranch High School students to avoid being classified as chronically absent. The 19 affected students claimed a religious exemption from the vaccine for whooping cough. The Washoe County Health Department says they should avoid going to school until 21 days after the last student was diagnosed. A school district official says the students will be in touch with their teachers and won’t be held back. She says absences because of a lack of vaccination can’t be excused under federal law. Three students at the school have been diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The Currier Museum of Art on Friday acquired a second New Hampshire home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Kalil House in Manchester was built in 1957 and is an example of the “Usonian Automatic” houses Wright designed as a more moderately priced option for the postwar middle class. The two-bedroom house, which includes the original furniture and fixtures, is made of modular concrete blocks made in Manchester and mahogany imported from the Philippines. It was built for Dr. Toufic and Mildred Kalil, who were inspired by the home of a friend whose Wright house had been built on the same street a few years earlier. That property, the Zimmerman house, was left to the Currier in 1988. The Kalil house went on sale this year. The Currier said an anonymous donor provided the funds.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPleasantville: More piping plover pairs nested in the state this year – 114 compared with 98 last year – with an average of 1.24 young per nest reaching independence, The Press of Atlantic City reports. That’s a 19% increase in pairs, according to the 2019 nesting results report by the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey and the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife Endangered and Nongame Species Program. But it’s still not back to the long-term average of 117 pairs and is well below the peak of 144 in 2003, the report states. Depredation, particularly by red foxes, continues to plague the endangered species that must build its nest in small impressions on beach sand. But residents in Brigantine and Stone Harbor have protested state programs to protect the plovers by trapping and killing red foxes there.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: New Mexico Highlands University says it’s developing a special anthropology master’s degree program focused on cultural resource management. If approved by higher education officials, the program would be delivered through distance learning. Highlands professor Orit Tamir developed the proposal with the goal of preparing people to work in the private sector or with tribal, state and federal agencies. In New Mexico, Tamir says, a master’s degree in anthropology is needed to be a principal or lead investigator on a cultural resources project or other forms of professional anthropology analysis. University Provost Roxanne Gonzales says offering the program through distance learning will allow working professionals to bolster their skills and make themselves more marketable. The program could begin as soon as fall 2020 once it gets final approval.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Winter hasn’t officially begun, but state officials are already urging families to start thinking about summer camp. Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos says online registration for the agency’s 2020 summer camps opens Jan. 26. Parents are encouraged to register early because some weeks fill up quickly. The department operates four residential camps: Colby in Saranac Lake, Camp DeBruce in Livingston Manor, Camp Rushford in Caneadea and Pack Forest in Warrensburg. The camps offer weeklong programs in conservation education for children ages 11 through 17. Activities include fishing, bird watching, fly-tying, archery, canoeing, hiking, camping, orienteering and hunter safety. One week of camp costs $350 per child.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: Authorities say three people were arrested during a protest near a Confederate statue slated for removal. The News & Observer reports a fight erupted Saturday in Pittsboro when protesters who oppose the statue’s removal complained about counterprotesters standing near a protester’s vehicle. The Chatham County Sheriff’s Office said 52-year-old Allan Wayne Hall was charged with inciting a riot and simple affray; 29-year-old Calvin James Megginson was charged with simple assault; and 63-year-old Robert Butler was charged with inciting a riot. All three live in Pittsboro. On Wednesday, a judge lifted an injunction that has blocked the county from removing the statue from where it has stood outside a courthouse since 1907. Several people have been arrested at previous protests.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A police sergeant has undergone a four-hour surgery after shooting himself in the hand. KFGO radio reports Sgt. Matt Ysteboe was hurt Friday while hunkering down after a man fired a gun toward officers. Fargo Police Chief David Todd says Ysteboe suffered a serious injury. No further information about Ysteboe’s condition was released. Todd says the 54-year-old suspect shot a revolver with a laser in the direction of officers and fired additional shots in the Radisson Hotel lobby, where he was arrested. No other injuries were reported. Ysteboe, who was the night shift supervisor Friday, has been with the department since 2001. He was promoted to sergeant in 2016.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A group of conservative lawmakers in the state has introduced a bill to outlaw abortion outright. State Rep. Candice Keller, a Republican from Middletown, says backers are tired of taking an incremental approach to ending abortion. The legislation was introduced Thursday. It declares a fetus a person and would subject doctors who terminate pregnancies to potential murder charges. The bill appears to make an exception for the life of the mother. Ohio is among states that have passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years in hopes of sparking a legal challenge that would overturn Roe v. Wade. The conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court has emboldened abortion opponents. The Ohio bill is opposed by abortion rights groups. The state’s largest anti-abortion group is remaining neutral.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals has upheld the class action designation of a lawsuit against an oil company over damage caused by earthquakes near Prague in November 2011, including one of magnitude 5.7. The court on Friday rejected the appeal of New Dominion LLC in the lawsuit filed by Jennifer Lin Cooper. Three other oil companies originally included in the lawsuit agreed to a settlement in December. The lawsuit alleges saltwater disposal wells led to the earthquakes. The 5.7 magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in Oklahoma until a magnitude 5.8 temblor struck near Pawnee in 2016. The lawsuit would include residents in Lincoln, Payne, Logan, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Pottawatomie, Seminole, Okfuskee and Creek counties who had earthquake-related property damage.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: The proposed Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas terminal and its 230-mile feeder pipeline in southern Oregon would have some adverse and significant impacts, according to staff at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the agency’s staff issued their final environmental analysis of the contentious natural gas export project Friday, concluding it would result in “temporary, long-term and permanent impacts on the environment.” The report says the project would impact Coos Bay and 18 threatened and endangered species. The report says many of those impacts would not be significant or could be reduced to less than significant levels with avoidance and mitigation measures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Discussions on raising the state’s minimum wage for the first time since 2009 are heating up, in part to get Gov. Tom Wolf to abandon an effort to extend overtime pay eligibility to tens of thousands of additional workers. Negotiators are up against a Thursday deadline, when a state rule-making board is scheduled to vote on an overtime regulation proposed by Wolf. If Wolf, a Democrat, is to get the GOP-controlled Legislature to agree to raise the minimum wage, he’ll have to make concessions, including rescinding the overtime proposal. The increase under negotiation is far more modest than what Wolf proposed in January when he pushed for a multiyear increase to $15 an hour in 2025. The discussion revolves around increasing the minimum wage to about $9.50 an hour in steps over 18 months or so, while Wolf would have to drop elements of his January proposal, including eliminating Pennsylvania’s tipped wage minimum, now $2.83.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo has announced her plan to make construction of new homes a priority as the state joins its neighbors at a “tipping point” of high housing costs. The Providence Journal reports Raimondo has not committed to any specific policy for dealing with the state’s housing issue in 2020 but has reiterated that having secure housing is a “moral” and “economic” imperative. The Democratic governor says the issue is one of supply and demand in which not enough homes are being built to meet the market’s demand and the affordable housing bonds are not enough to help fill the gap. The newspaper reports the state’s housing market has come back somewhat after the recession, but as home prices rise steadily, construction of new units remains idle.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina is investigating members of a fraternity who a television reporter says made sexist and offensive remarks to her while she was working. WACH-TV says reporter Brittany Breeding was covering Lambda Chi Alpha’s four-year suspension Monday when some fraternity members yelled out derogatory remarks at her. University spokesman Jeff Stensland says a staff member witnessed the harassment and reported it. Fraternity spokesman Tad Lichtenauer says it expects ethical behavior from all students and takes harassment allegations seriously. News outlets report Lambda Chi Alpha had already been suspended from the school’s campus until 2023 because of hazing allegations involving violence and alcohol.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An organization in the state has received a national award for its work in immigration and justice. South Dakota Voices for Peace was named a winner of the J.M.K. Innovation Prize, which is given to groups working on social challenges in the United States, according to a news release from the J.M. Kaplan Fund. South Dakota Voices for Peace, along with its sister organization South Dakota Voices for Justice, aims to counter anti-immigrant, anti-refugee and anti-Muslim legislation as well as build a rural model to sustain immigration services. The award is given out every other year to 10 organizations nationwide. Each awardee receives up to $175,000 over three years and the ability to work with other social justice organizations.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Volkswagen plans to donate $1.25 million to help expand Cherokee National Forest near the company’s Chattanooga plant and offer community grants. The Conservation Fund has announced a collaboration with Volkswagen to open three tracts near the plant for outdoor public recreation and to protect the habitat for the black bear and the Indiana bat. Volkswagen is using $200,000 of the $1.25 million on community grants up to $50,000 each to help nonprofits, schools and public agencies improve water quality, increase outdoor recreation access and advance environmental education. Volkswagen broke ground Wednesday on an $800 million expansion to make electric cars in Chattanooga. The company has sought to transform itself after the 2015 diesel scandal, in which Volkswagen was caught using software to cheat on emissions testing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Planned Parenthood gave up roughly $60 million when it left a federal family planning program this year in opposition to a new Trump administration rule prohibiting clinics from referring women for abortions. In Texas, a network of eight Christian pregnancy centers is jockeying for that Title X funding as it makes plans to take the unprecedented step of offering unmarried women contraceptives next year. The move by The Source marks a turning point for faith-based pregnancy centers that are opposed to abortions and typically do not provide birth control, while they instead preach abstinence outside of marriage. Andy Schoonover, chief executive for The Source, said the nonprofit organization will add contraception options including pills, injections and intrauterine devices to its services. The chain of clinics will not provide the morning-after pill or copper-based IUDs.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Karen Pence visited the city to file paperwork to put President Donald Trump on the state’s GOP primary ballot in the 2020 presidential race. The Deseret News reports Vice President Mike Pence’s wife told supporters Friday that the race will be close. She also highlighted Trump’s support of religious liberty and other conservative values. Republican Sen. Mike Lee will serve as co-chairman of the president’s re-election campaign in the state – a turnaround from 2016, when he led a fight against Trump’s nomination. Lee says he took the “scenic route” to becoming a Trump supporter and respects him for keeping campaign promises. Reps. Chris Stewart and Rob Bishop as well as former Sen. Orrin Hatch are also among the honorary co-chairmen of the Trump Victory campaign in Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBellows Falls: A community group is attempting to save a former YMCA building that the town wants to demolish. Elijah Zimmer told village trustees last week that the group has received an emergency grant to evaluate the structure and has applied for emergency repair funds. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the structure was built in 1835. It used to be a YMCA and at one time was a church. Zimmer says the building, if restored, could provide a large community space that Bellows Falls lacks. Trustees say the structure is so deteriorated that it isn’t safe to have workers inside, and money is being spent on barriers. Trustees voted to pursue legal options for demolition, but some said they hope Zimmer can save the building.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Three African American lawmakers are expected to lead powerful legislative committees next year in the House of Delegates. Black legislators haven’t led a House committee in two decades. Democratic Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, who is set to be the next House speaker, announced the heads of four legislative committees Thursday. Three of the four are African American. Del. Luke Torian will lead the House Appropriations Committee; Del. Jeion Ward will lead the House Commerce and Labor Committee; and Del. Roslyn Tyler will lead the House Education Committee. Democrats flipped control of the Virginia’s General Assembly in legislative elections this month.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Military families have raised concerns saying housing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord made them sick. KOMO-TV reports multiple families who were living on the base are now living in motels and recreational vehicles because of moldy conditions. Private company officials from Lincoln Military Housing say they are working to fix the problem. Army wife Kelsey White says the mold gave her family serious health issues, including her 7-month-old son. Company officials say the White family was put in a motel and then moved to an RV because no other on-base housing was offered. Company officials say they are preparing a statement in response to concerns. Attorneys for the White family and 22 other military families expect to file a lawsuit in the next few months.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A library says violent threats prompted it to cancel an event where drag queens were going to read to children. The Morgantown Public Library System announced it was canceling its Drag Queen Story Time event in a Facebook post Friday. The statement cited “multiple threats of violence against the volunteer readers” as the reason for the cancellation. A voicemail left at the library wasn’t immediately returned. The library’s statement says it “remains committed to fostering a love of reading for all ages” and will instead have its staffers read for the event Saturday morning. Libraries and bookstores across the country have had similar events where men in drag read stories to kids, with some drawing protests.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFlorence: Florence County, in rural northeastern Wisconsin, has declared itself a Second Amendment sanctuary, a move commissioners say is designed to send a “keep your hands off our guns” message to politicians. The nonbinding measure gives the sheriff the ability to “exercise sound discretion to not enforce against any citizen an unconstitutional firearms law.” Florence County Supervisor Edwin Kelley says a recent call by Gov. Tony Evers for gun control action has made his constituents nervous. Sheriff Dan Miller says people who live “up north” tend to be more conservative and like their guns. He says the ordinance “sends a message that all of Wisconsin is not exactly the same.” The ordinance doesn’t mean firearms will not be taken away from convicted felons or in criminal cases, including domestic violence or drugs.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Lawmakers have decided against giving college students more state scholarship money for high grades. The Joint Education Interim Committee voted 8-5 against the proposal Thursday in Cheyenne. The bill would have enabled students to boost Hathaway Scholarship funding by maintaining a 3.75 GPA for two consecutive semesters. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports some lawmakers worry GPA-based incentives would be unfair for students seeking certain degrees. Students can use the Hathaway Scholarship at the University of Wyoming or any in-state community college. The bill would have increased the amount awarded through the scholarships by $3.6 million annually. Democratic Sen. Chris Rothfuss, of Laramie, says he would rather use the increase for more scholarship funding overall.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/11/speakers-death-concert-memorial-open-playgrounds-news-around-states/115133114/", "title": "Speaker's death, concert memorial: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Before his death from COVID-19, former state senator Larry Dixon spoke to his wife of 53 years from his hospital bed and asked her to relay a warning. “Sweetheart, we messed up. We just dropped our guard,” Dr. David Thrasher, a pulmonologist and friend of Dixon, recalled him saying. Dixon, 78, died Friday from complications of COVID-19. Thrasher said his longtime friend had been mostly careful but may have contracted the virus after gathering with friends. “Larry has been conscientious with masks, doing everything right, social distancing since March … he made one slip-up,” Thrasher said. Three people at the gathering became ill, he said. “The last thing he told her was, ‘Gaynell, I love you. We’ve got to tell people this is real,’ ” Thrasher said. He said he’s telling his friend’s story with the family’s permission in the hopes that people can learn just how easily the virus can spread at casual gatherings. He said it is also important for people to seek medical care when they first get sick.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials at the state’s largest homeless shelter are optimistic that demand for services has stabilized for now. The emergency mass shelter at Anchorage’s Sullivan Arena serves 400 people, with about 200 more at a newly opened shelter at the Fairview Recreation Center and in hotel rooms funded by the city, Alaska Public Media reports. There are more people in the Anchorage shelter system now than there have been during any other year on record, Anchorage Housing and Homeless Services Coordinator Nancy Burke said. However, a moratorium on evictions of people behind on rent payments because of the coronavirus pandemic is scheduled to end Dec. 31. “People, frankly, are running out of money with the assistance that was coming in from the federal government,” Burke said. “So we could see an increase even beyond what we’ve seen so far.” Sullivan Arena workers observed an increase in demand as temperatures dropped in recent months. They laid out extra floor mats to increase capacity, but demand has continued rising, said Cathleen McLaughlin, who oversees that shelter.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has ruled the city erroneously excluded immigrants from receiving coronavirus aid to cover utility bills, mortgage and rental costs. The city required applicants to its $25 million utility, rent and mortgage assistance program to provide proof of legal status in the United States. The coronavirus’ current surge saw Arizona on Thursday report nearly 5,000 additional known COVID-19 cases, the eighth day in the past 10 that the state has reported over 4,000 additional cases. It added a record 12,314 cases Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Dominic Lanza concluded Wednesday that Phoenix isn’t required to exclude unqualified immigrants from participating because the assistance program falls within exceptions in federal law for “short-term, non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster relief.” The judge said the city’s decision to exclude immigrants was trumped by federal law. The judge said the city has said its decision to exclude immigrants wasn’t a policy decision but rather based solely on its interpretation of federal law. Lanza said Phoenix has indicated it will begin allowing immigrants to participate in the program in the future.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter County Library is hosting a virtual visit from Santa Claus on Saturday morning, live from 9 to 10 a.m. Viewers can wear pajamas, drink milk and eat cookies at home while joining a special live Storytime with Santa on Facebook Live on the Baxter County Library’s page. They can enjoy time with Santa to sing songs and listen to stories. Those unable to join during the live Storytime can visit the library’s YouTube channel. To keep up with other programs happening at the library, visit the library’s website at baxlib.org.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state changed its rules overnight Wednesday to allow outdoor playgrounds to stay open in regions under strict stay-home orders, apparently swayed by broad criticism that closing them would harm children who have few options to safely romp outside. On its website, the state said playgrounds could stay open to “facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise.” Ali Bay, a spokesperson for California’s Department of Public Health, said in an email that the change was new as of Wednesday morning, and the department was working to share the news more broadly. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has come under heavy criticism for the closure of children’s playgrounds when the administration has repeatedly said being outdoors is safer than being indoors, and there is little evidence of virus spread on playground structures. Playground advocates have said children need fresh air and exercise for their emotional and physical health, and many don’t have access to private backyards. Fraught parents also need a place to take their cooped-up kids, advocates said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Colorado Springs barbershop owner has sued the governor in relation to roughly $4 million in coronavirus relief designated for minority-owned small businesses, claiming the funding is unconstitutional, and the race-based requirement should be removed. Locals Barbershop owner Etienne Hardre, who is white, filed the lawsuit against Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, the state minority business office and its director. Hardre argued the aid intended for businesses that are at least 51% minority-owned is based entirely on race and is discriminatory, The Denver Post reports. “The Supreme Court has held that if you are going to do race-conscious measures, you are required to specify the past or present discrimination you are remedying,” Hardre’s attorney Michael Kuhn said. “And societal, so-called systemic racism isn’t sufficient.” The lawsuit said Hardre lost a third of his barbershop’s revenue during the pandemic, but since he is white, he can’t receive the aid designated for minority-owned businesses. “We have nothing against minorities, minorities are fantastic,” Hardre said. “However, everybody, all Americans, all Coloradans have been hurt. Business owners of all kinds, whites as well as minorities.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A coalition of public education unions is demanding that schools shift to full-time remote learning if statewide COVID-19 safety protocols and a uniform policy for reporting and responding to positive cases are not required. The group, which submitted a petition signed by nearly 14,000 education and community members to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s office Thursday, contends that policies are inconsistent by district and that teachers and staff, as well as students, are being put at risk for contracting COVID-19. “What we know is that in different places in Connecticut, in different districts, superintendents are under tremendous pressure to try to make sure that every kid is coming into school,” said Jeff Leake, president of the Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union. He said there are some districts where students are not wearing masks, and superintendents are not sending them home, as well as schools where the standard 6 feet of social distancing has dropped to 3 feet or less. Meanwhile, union officials acknowledged that social distancing and other safety measures are working in some districts and said those schools should remain open.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state reported records Wednesday for its daily average of new coronavirus cases and for hospitalizations. The state reported 925 new cases, the second most it’s reported in a single day trailing only last Thursday, when there were 936 new cases. The seven-day average for new cases increased to 810.9. The daily case average record has been broken in 11 consecutive days. On the day after Delaware surpassed its spring peak, the number of hospitalizations in the state increased by 10 to 348. Based on the increasing case counts over the past several weeks, the number of hospitalizations will likely continue to increase and threaten the state’s capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. “Those hospitalization numbers are as real as real can be,” Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. Since the start of November, the average daily case count has quintupled. It’s increased from 531.4 to 810.9 (a 52.6% rise) since the start of December. Increased testing accounts for some of the increase, but the percentage of tests that are positive is also rising, with the seven-day average now 10%, the highest it’s been this fall.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., wants the National Park Service to ensure its employees are safe from contracting COVID-19 and asked NPS in a letter to close monument access and visitor centers even more amid the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. Norton sent a letter to Margaret Everson, acting director of NPS, about the safety of employees amid the highest levels yet of the coronavirus in the capital region, the congresswoman’s office said in a statement. Norton’s letter asked Everson to close the Washington Monument, visitor centers, and any other indoor properties in the National Capital Region until this wave of the virus has subsided. “I understand that there have been at least four cases of COVID-19 and one hospitalization among NPS employees who work on the National Mall,” Norton said. “NPS employees need to be able to protect themselves and their families during this time of crisis.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Democrats in the state Senate on Thursday called on Gov. Ron DeSantis to either lead the state’s coronavirus fight or get out of the way and allow the Legislature to do it. Gathered in a video conference on Facebook, the group accused the Republican governor of rarely being seen or heard since the Nov. 3 election, maintaining a tight grip on public information about the virus, and politicizing a public health crisis. Some public health officials criticized Florida’s lifting of restrictions over the summer and DeSantis’ resistance to a statewide mask mandate as reckless. “A mask is not a symbol of liberty. It is a tool that will stop the spread of this terrible disease and save lives,” said Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton. Talking to reporters two weeks ago, DeSantis mocked mask mandates and lockdowns as ineffective tools to fight the virus. And this past weekend, he hosted Republican Party activists at the Governor’s Mansion. In tweeted photos, it appeared no one was wearing masks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: As COVID-19 continues to rise in Georgia, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold D. Martin is urging the state’s courts to reevaluate resuming jury trials and other in-person court proceedings. In a statement Wednesday, Melton said judges may need to reverse course on the in-person hearings if the spread of the virus prevents them from doing so safely. Melton made the statement after signing his ninth order extending the statewide judicial emergency he first announced March 14 due to the pandemic. “While this order does not impose a blanket shutdown of non-essential in-person proceedings, courts should remain vigilant of changing COVID-19 conditions and be prepared to suspend jury trials as necessary and to reconsider grand jury proceedings as well,” the order says. It also urged courts to conduct proceedings remotely if possible. “We recognize there is such a thing as Zoom fatigue,” the chief justice said. “But we urge people not to get weary just yet.” The latest order extends the judicial emergency another 30 days to Jan. 8.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s biggest surfing competition of the year has started amid ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus among fans eager to watch the action. The 2020 Billabong Pipe Masters began Tuesday on Oahu’s North Shore and is scheduled to run through Dec. 20, with crowds watching surfers ride waves reaching up to 30 feet high, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Hundreds of spectators were at Ehukai Beach Park on the first day, with few wearing masks and limited social distancing. The World Surf League, which organizes the annual event, has changed the format in an attempt to reduce the large crowds associated with pro surfing contests. The organization is trying to minimize the in-person audience by eliminating announcers and other public attractions that are normally staples of surfing events, said Michele Nekota of the Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation, which issues permits for the competitions. “They are basically advertising as a virtual event, so we’re having competitors, but not spectators,” Nekota said. Mailers were sent to North Shore households urging residents to stream the event live from home.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Thursday that residents can expect diminished health care if hospitals fill with COVID-19 patients and the state has to initiate crisis standards of care. The Republican governor warned of the impending standards during a news conference on the same day health officials announced COVID-19 was the state’s leading cause of death in November. Little also said county morgues were asking for mobile refrigerators to hold bodies. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said the illness killed 247 people last month. COVID-19 has killed just over 1,100 residents to date, making it the third-leading cause of death in Idaho for the year. That’s about four to five times the number of annual deaths from flu and pneumonia. More than 116,000 residents have been infected. A northern Idaho doctor who took part in the news conference said some of them could face lasting lung damage from the disease. “This is not like any virus I’ve ever seen,” said Robert Scoggins, a doctor at Kootenai Health in Coeur d’Alene who specializes in pulmonary diseases and critical care medicine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials on Wednesday reported 179 deaths related to COVID-19 in the state. That’s the fourth-highest single-day fatality total since the coronavirus entered Illinois in February. The largest total was 238 on Dec. 2. Officials are still expecting darker days ahead – a surge of new cases of COVID-19 and deaths to accompany them because of holiday gatherings where the virus can spread. But the number of fresh infections recorded Wednesday was 8,256, marking the fifth day in a row the number has fallen below 10,000. There were 5,284 COVID-19 patients hospitalized, a number that has not been lower than 5,000 since Nov. 10. There was a slight uptick from the previous day in the sickest patients, with 1,176 in intensive care and 647 on ventilators. Overall, 13,666 Illinoisans have died as a result of COVID-19 complications, and 812,430 have tested positive for the virus.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s hospitals will have to postpone elective surgeries starting next week under an order the governor said Wednesday was needed to free up hospital capacity amid steep recent increases in serious COVID-19 illnesses. An initial shipment of some 55,000 doses of the first coronavirus vaccine is expected to arrive at Indiana hospitals next week as front-line health care workers start to receive shots. Gov. Eric Holcomb said hospitals were being directed to postpone all non-urgent inpatient surgeries beginning Dec. 16 through Jan. 3. Holcomb said Indiana is “on fire” with coronavirus spread, as the number of counties with the highest risk level of coronavirus spread more than doubled in the state health department’s weekly update. The state halted elective medical procedures for most of April, but Holcomb lifted that restriction as concerns eased about availability of equipment and protective gear. But Indiana’s hospitals are currently treating more than quadruple the number of COVID-19 patients than they were in September, with health officials worried about facilities being overwhelmed.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Public health officials posted another 99 coronavirus-related deaths Thursday, raising the state’s death toll to 3,120. The state this week modified the methodology for counting COVID-19 deaths, which has added 399 deaths to the state total in the past three days. COVID-19 cases increased by 2,246, pushing the state total to 251,028. Hospitalizations and admissions were lower Thursday, with 863 people hospitalized with COVID-19. Hospitalizations and new positive cases have been trending lower, giving health care officials hope that Iowa may not see the spike in virus activity after Thanksgiving that was anticipated. “I still think we’re not out of the danger zone. We’re still facing a winter season that’s going to keep people indoors,” said University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics CEO Suresh Gunasekaran. “There’s going to be an opportunity with another holiday season right around us to be vulnerable for this.” Vaccinations of front-line health care workers and nursing home residents and employees may begin next week, but the White House Coronavirus Task Force warns against complacency about mask-wearing, distancing and handwashing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Wednesday imposed stronger coronavirus testing rules for several hundred state-licensed nursing homes that will have most of them testing their employees twice a week. The executive order on testing comes as Kansas waits to receive its first shipments of a vaccine made by Pfizer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to consider within days whether to authorize emergency use of the two-dose vaccine. If it does, the state expects the first shipments by the end of next week. The order affecting nursing homes applies to more than 470 facilities and imposes the same testing requirements already faced by about 360 homes in Kansas licensed by the federal government. The rules require greater testing of employees if a county’s rate of positive tests grows. “Now that we have broader testing capacity in the state, it’s really a commonsense measure,” Laura Howard, the top administrator at the state Department for Aging and Disability Services, said during a Statehouse news conference.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Legislative Republicans who expanded their supermajorities in last month’s election were given a mandate by voters to put limits on the Democratic governor’s executive powers in times of emergency, a leading GOP lawmaker said Wednesday. Senate Republican leaders outlined main issues awaiting them when the General Assembly convenes in January for a 30-day session. Passing another state budget tops the agenda, but debate about limiting the scope of a governor’s emergency powers will be a priority, too. Kentucky’s response to the coronavirus threat “pointed out holes” in state laws and the constitution, Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer said. The push to rein in the governor’s authority represents something of a turnabout from the position Republican lawmakers generally took with Beshear’s predecessor, GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, when they largely stood by as he wielded his gubernatorial powers. But Bevin didn’t confront a crisis on the scale of the global pandemic during his one term in office. Beshear spokeswoman Crystal Staley responded that it’s “unfortunate” the governor is being attacked while he’s “focused on defeating COVID-19 and saving lives.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nConvent: St. James Parish canceled its annual Christmas Eve bonfire celebration due to an increase in coronavirus cases, officials said. Parish officials called off the event Wednesday after discussing possible plans with the State Fire Marshal’s office, news outlets report. Officials said they were concerned about the crowds the event could bring in and how they could maintain social distancing, as the event runs for miles along the Mississippi River levee. The two groups tried to find an alternative way to hold the bonfire safely, but rising COVID-19 cases halted the discussion. On Wednesday, the parish said its positivity rate had nearly doubled, hitting 16.9%. “This was by no means an easy decision to make, as this tradition is long-standing and special to our community in particular,” parish officials said Wednesday. “We understand this has been an extremely difficult year for many of us, and we have hoped for a sense of normalcy in the Christmas season especially; however, we must first and foremost protect the health, safety and well-being of our residents.” The Christmas Eve bonfire celebrations in St. James and other river parishes may have begun in the late 1800s. The bonfires are tepee-shaped and are said to light the way for Papa Noel on his nighttime ride to deliver gifts.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The bishop of Maine’s Roman Catholic diocese is calling on all Christians – and everyone else – to get the coronavirus vaccine when it’s available to them. Bishop Robert Deeley of the Diocese of Portland said he has been fielding questions from Christians in the state about his perspective on the vaccine. He said Thursday that he unequivocally supports vaccines for everyone. “Our first response must be to give thanks to God for the scientific advancement and talent that helped to create such lifesaving vaccines,” Deeley said. “I have already been asked several times: Should I receive the vaccine when it is available to me? My answer is a resounding yes.” Deeley said he is concerned about enough people using the vaccine in Maine because the state has had lower-than-average rates of vaccine uptake in the past. That has led to resurgences of diseases such as whooping cough in Maine. He said it’s imperative for Catholics to “care about the common good.”\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: The University of Maryland will begin its spring semester with virtual learning and continue the semester with a similar “look and feel” to its fall classes, according to the school’s president. Students will mostly have virtual classes for the first two weeks of the semester before the school shifts to hybrid learning, University President Darryll J. Pines wrote in a Tuesday letter to the university community. Only about 25% of the classes will be in-person when hybrid learning resumes. “If there is a lesson that we have learned throughout this pandemic, it is this: We must remain nimble and flexible and expect change,” Pines wrote. “If new information comes to light, we will not hesitate to adapt our plans accordingly.” All students are required to submit a negative COVID-19 test before coming back to campus. Everyone who will be on campus will also have to get tested for the virus every two weeks. Pines said students will have two weeks of virtual classes after spring break to allow for campuswide testing before in-person classes resume. Dorms will also operate at a reduced capacity, with students residing only in single rooms.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker did not overstep his authority when he issued sweeping orders to close businesses and limit gatherings to control the spread of the coronavirus, the highest court in Massachusetts said in a ruling released Thursday. The Supreme Judicial Court rejected a challenge brought on behalf of a group including salon owners, pastors and the headmaster of a private school, who accused the Republican governor of exercising “legislative police power” by declaring a state of emergency under the state’s Civil Defense Act. The court said the pandemic clearly merits action by the governor under the Cold War-era law. It also rejected the lawsuit’s argument that the governor’s actions infringe on people’s constitutional rights to due process and free assembly. “Given that COVID-19 is a pandemic that has killed over a million people worldwide, it spreads from person to person, effective vaccines have not yet been distributed, there is no known cure, and a rise in cases threatens to overrun the Commonwealth’s hospital system, it is a natural cause for which action is needed,” the court wrote, quoting the state law.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state’s top epidemiologist said Wednesday that there’s reason for “cautious optimism” as new data emerges about the spread of coronavirus in the state. COVID-19 case rates are starting to dip, and Michigan is now averaging about 516 cases per million people, down from 610 cases per million last week, said Sarah Lyon-Callo, director of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Population Health at the state health department. And hospitalizations of people with COVID-19 symptoms and the rate of intensive care unit admissions appears to be plateauing or declining, too, she said, even though the state overall is now seeing hospitalizations at about 90% of the spring peak. These are encouraging signs that suggest the coronavirus public health restrictions put in place last month – temporarily halting indoor dining at bars and restaurants and canceling in-person classes at high schools and colleges – might be starting to flatten the curve. It’s still too soon to say definitively whether Thanksgiving might change the outlook for Michigan when it comes to COVID-19, Lyon-Callo said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials said they’re grateful that the spread of the coronavirus appears to have stabilized in recent days but cautioned Wednesday that case growth and hospitalization levels remain worryingly high. Meanwhile, Gov. Tim Walz formally called a special session of the Legislature for Monday to pass a relief package for businesses and workers affected by the four-week “pause” he ordered last month. Those restrictions included a shutdown of bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery, gyms, and other activities, including high school sports. The governor has not yet said whether he’ll extend any of those restrictions past Dec. 18. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 4,539 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and 82 new deaths, the state’s third-highest one-day total of the pandemic. Three-fourths of the deaths were patients from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The new cases raised Minnesota’s total case count to 363,719 and its cumulative death toll to 4,109. The state is on pace to surpass 400,000 cases “within the next week or so,” Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Wednesday defended his decision to hold Christmas parties at the Governor’s Mansion, despite repeatedly warning residents to avoid social gatherings as coronavirus cases surge. The Republican governor said he invited family, friends and state officials to the multiple parties, but he expects many will choose not to attend. The front part of the Governor’s Mansion is a museum that is open by appointment only, and the Reeves family lives in a private portion in the back. Reeves compared the parties to tours that have been happening during the pandemic. No more than 10 people are allowed on each tour of the historic home, and masks are required. “What I think we are doing by offering the public the opportunity to, for instance, tour the Governor’s Mansion, is to offer a sense of normalcy,” Reeves said during a news conference. In a story first reported by Mississippi Today, elected officials said they were invited to a governor’s Christmas party happening Wednesday. The governor also invited lawmakers to separate parties next week.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported 67 new deaths from the coronavirus, adding to a total that has risen sharply since the start of the month. Only 10 other states have reported more deaths than Missouri over the past seven days, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Service’s daily tracking dashboard. Since Dec. 1, the state has cited 195 new deaths among the 290,000 Americans killed by the virus since its onset. Among the recent deaths was a young woman in her upper teens from Taney County. Hospitals remain dangerously close to full. Inpatient bed capacity is down to 22% statewide, and intensive care unit bed space is in even worse shape – 18% statewide. In northeast Missouri, just 3% of ICU beds are available, 6% are available in the southwestern part of the state and 9% in northwest Missouri, according to health department data. KCUR reports that state data on hospitalizations – often cited by Gov. Mike Parson and other leaders as evidence that hospitals were not at risk – was unreliable into the fall, in part because many hospitals failed to follow reporting guidelines.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Alluvion Health is holding a drive-thru flu shot clinic Friday that is open to the public for people age 12 and older. Shots are available for $30 but are offered at no cost with most health insurance plans, according to a release, and no one will be turned away for financial reasons. The drive-thru clinic is being held at the Montana ExpoPark from noon to 4 p.m. Friday. “This year, it is more important than ever to ensure you and your family are protected against influenza,” the release says. Immunization is the best way to stop the spread of influenza, Alluvion said, but officials also encouraged the same methods used for combatting COVID-19, such as regular hand-washing, covering coughs, wearing a mask and staying home when sick.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A prisoner in his 60s died at a Lincoln hospital Wednesday after testing positive for the coronavirus in mid-November, corrections officials said. Corrections officials said the inmate had underlying medical conditions, and the exact cause of death hasn’t been confirmed. Officials did not release the inmate’s identity but said he was serving time for a robbery conviction in Seward County. A grand jury will investigate the death, as is normal procedure. Nebraska officials reported 781 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in the state as of Wednesday evening, a decline from last month’s record highs but still far more than the number earlier this year. The state confirmed 1,321 new cases, bringing the total to 143,924 since the pandemic began. So far, 1,294 people have died after contracting the virus. About two-thirds of those who have died were at least 75 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state is adding another voluntary, free app to efforts to track person-to-person coronavirus contacts, with the launch Thursday of the Exposure Notification Express program developed by Apple and Google. The Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that Nevada will be the first state to use both ENX and a COVID Trace app the state launched Aug. 24. COVID Trace has more than 130,000 downloads, representing a fraction of the more than 3 million people in a state where 176,334 cases of COVID-19 have been reported since March. ENX is available for all Apple devices, said Julia Peek, the state official overseeing contact tracing efforts in Nevada, and COVID Trace will continue to be available in both the iOS App Store and Android’s Google Play Store. Peek said the apps are “completely anonymous, private and secure.” By opting in, app users receive COVID-19 notifications informing them if they have been near someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and reported their exposure to the program. ENX and COVID Trace both use Bluetooth technology and will work together, Peek said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State House Speaker Dick Hinch died from COVID-19, a medical examiner ruled Thursday following his unexpected death. Hinch, who was only sworn in as leader of the state’s newly Republican-led Legislature a week ago, died Wednesday. Hinch was 71 and was starting his seventh, two-year term in the state House. His death was announced Wednesday night by his office, which did not give any details of what it called “this unexpected tragedy.” Hinch is the first New Hampshire speaker to die during the session, according to House Clerk Paul Smith. “We are sitting in unchartered territory here,” Smith said. The swearing in of the the 400-member House and 24-member Senate was held outdoors at the University of New Hampshire because of the pandemic. More than a quarter of House members, most of them Democrats, skipped the ceremony after learning the day before that several Republican lawmakers had tested positive for the virus after attending an indoor GOP caucus meeting Nov. 20 where many attendees weren’t wearing masks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: How New Jerseyans handle the upcoming holidays could prevent thousands of people from going to the hospital with COVID-19 and hundreds from needing to be put on ventilators, according to new four-month modeling predictions from the state Department of Health and the Office of Innovation released Wednesday. In the worst-case prediction, more New Jersey residents could be hospitalized than during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring – if people travel for the holidays and continue social gatherings. That interaction would cause the virus to spread more than during past religious holidays and after the reopening of indoor dining and schools, according to both agencies. About 8,747 people could be hospitalized during the peak of the second wave Jan. 13, predicts the state Department of Health, while the Office of Innovation’s best guess is a peak of 8,689 people in the hospital Feb. 5. During the first wave, 8,270 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 on April 14, according to the governor’s office.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has begun monitoring sewage from prisons and youth rehabilitation facilities to more efficiently detect COVID-19 outbreaks in the southwest of the state, the state Environment Department announced Wednesday. The agency says the goal is to sample human feces in group-living situations to quickly identify coronavirus outbreaks. The results may be used to more effectively deploy individual testing to pinpoint infections and halt the spread. Sampling will take place at federal, state and local jails, along with facilities overseen by the state Children, Youth and Families Department. Environment Department spokeswoman Maddy Hayden said the initial effort comes at a cost of about $300,000, utilizing federal relief funds. The southwest region was selected for the initial phase of testing because of high positivity rates along with limited access to testing. New Mexico on Wednesday reported an additional 1,759 COVID-19 cases, bringing the statewide total to nearly 113,000 since the pandemic began. An additional 34 deaths also were reported, including a woman in her 30s.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Coronavirus infections and deaths are rising in the state’s nursing homes amid a race to deploy a COVID-19 vaccine among frail and elderly people most vulnerable to the respiratory disease. Since late September, at least 2,240 nursing home residents have contracted COVID-19 in New York, resulting in 219 deaths, according to USA TODAY Network analysis of the latest federal data through Nov. 22. Of the deaths, about 45% hit during a two-week stretch as infections spiked last month inside nursing homes, offering an early warning of the virus’s renewed assault on long-term care facilities just days before the expected arrival of 170,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in New York as soon as this weekend. And while state government plans to prioritize all 170,000 initial doses for nursing home residents and staff, the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine involved requires each person to take two doses separated by 21 days to build up immunity, meaning New York nursing homes will remain at risk into January.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican legislative leaders said Thursday that they’ve found a solution to address the potential loss of $30 million in federal coronavirus relief funds that lawmakers earmarked for rural broadband projects. A state law approved in September had funneled the money to a broadband program. But Cooper’s administration and GOP lawmakers disagreed on whether federal guidance required the money be spent by Dec. 30. Under the announced agreement, Cooper will redirect the $30 million to other federal COVID-19 relief qualifying expenses that would have otherwise been paid for with state government operating funds. The legislature, in turn, will vote in early 2021 to spend $30 million in state funds for the rural broadband initiative called the GREAT program.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum on Wednesday extended an executive order that requires people to wear masks and limits the size of gatherings until next month but will allow high school sports to resume next week. The Republican governor issued the executive order Nov. 13, and it was set expire Sunday. The mandate, which has been extended until Jan. 18, requires residents to wear face coverings in indoor businesses and indoor public settings, as well as outdoor public settings where physical distancing isn’t possible. Burgum also directed all bars and restaurants to limit capacity to 50% and closed all in-person services between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Large-scale venues also are limited to 25% capacity. The governor extended that part of the order until Jan. 8, saying the shorter extension “recognizes the economic impact” the restrictions have placed on businesses. Since the order has gone into effect, North Dakota has dropped from first to 10th in the country for new cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: For years, alumni of an area high school have gathered to raise scholarship money in memory of three classmates killed in a crush of people at a 1979 concert by The Who in Cincinnati. And they were determined to do it again in 2020, despite the pandemic. They just didn’t know how. But with the help of their friends – including two famous ones – they had their most memorable evening yet. Fred Wittenbaum, one of the organizers of the fundraiser, said he and others had kicked around “some strange ideas” for the benefit, normally held over the past decade in the Finneytown High School performing arts center. In the end, Saturday night’s show included prerecorded video interviews with The Who’s frontman Roger Daltrey and guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend, plus a mix of recorded and live discussions with relatives of the 11 people killed Dec. 3, 1979. There were also plenty of covers of the Rock & Roll Hall of Famers’ music performed by alumni rock bands and taped in a park along the Ohio River and at other scenic venues in and around Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Mayor G.T. Bynum said Wednesday that he’s disgusted that some cities, particularly in the Tulsa area, have not mandated mask-wearing to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Cities with mask ordinances listened to medical professionals, Bynum said, suggesting city leaders in some other municipalities who opposed mask mandates took advice from “Facebook epidemiologists who can cite some sham website and claim that makes them an expert on the value of mask-wearing.” Many Tulsa suburbs have adopted mask ordinances, but officials in nearby Broken Arrow on Nov. 23 rejected a proposal to strongly encourage mask-wearing. Meanwhile, Tulsa International Airport announced Thursday that it will begin offering coronavirus testing for current and recent airline passengers. The airport board approved testing at a terminal beginning Jan. 4 for people who are flying or have flown in the previous three days. Tests will cost from $70 for the rapid antigen test to $185 for a complete respiratory test. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday reported 2,460 new cases of the virus and 35 more deaths.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state continues to break records for COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The state reported 10,355 new cases between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6 – a 14% increase over the previous week and a record high for the seventh week in a row. Through Dec. 6, a total of 85,788 cases had been reported. That means 2% of Oregonians have had positive or presumptive cases. COVID-19 hospitalizations for last week increased to 494, a 24% increase over the previous week. There were 133 COVID-19 deaths reported over the week, an average of 19 per day. That’s the highest since the pandemic began. There were 170,964 COVID-19 tests administered in Oregon during the week. The percentage of positive tests was 8.1%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A group of Democrats in the state House of Representatives wants their adamantly maskless Republican colleagues to be sworn in next month after everyone else, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a safety measure, the 203 state representatives will take the oath of office Jan. 5 in four sets of about 50 people each, starting with newly elected members, the House speaker’s office said Wednesday. Philadelphia state Rep. Joe Hohenstein, who has objected strenuously to some Republicans remaining maskless during recent State Government Committee meetings, said there is “significant support” among his fellow Democrats to have the maskless “just simply be placed at the end of the line so that they don’t potentially contaminate the House floor.” Hohenstein said a medical exception to the House bipartisan leadership group’s policy on masks needs some teeth, suggesting the leaders might require a doctor’s note verifying the maskless member’s condition. In a memo to members sent last week, House Speaker Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster, said masks “will be required of everyone unless an individual cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Restrictions on some businesses that began late last month to counter a second surge of COVID-19 cases in the state will be extended one more week, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Thursday. Raimondo’s “two-week pause” that began Nov. 30 will now run through Dec. 20, the Democrat said at a news conference. Certain key metrics used to measure the spread of the virus, including the hospitalization rate and the percent positive rate, have not declined as hoped, she said. She also noted that Rhode Island has the highest infection rate per capita in the country, something she attributed in part to the state’s aggressive testing program. “If we continue to stay at home as much as possible for that week, for next week, I believe it will have the impact that we need,” she said. An extra $200 per week in unemployment benefits for workers who have lost their jobs will be extended another week. When the pause ends, starting Dec. 21, closed businesses will be allowed to open with limited capacity, and restaurants will be allowed to move to 50% capacity, Raimondo said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Prisoners and poultry plant workers will follow soon after front-line health care employees in the state’s COVID-19 vaccine plan, Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday. At the outset of the first phase of the state’s vaccine distribution plan, the state will focus on health care employees including physicians, medical students, speech pathologists, and residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, McMaster said. He said the second half of the state’s first phase will include people living in settings such as prisons, jails and homeless shelters, as well as processing plant and other food production workers, plus utilities employees. The governor said others included will be those age 75 and older and people with two or more underlying health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. Among people to be prioritized in the state’s second phase are pharmacists, K-12 school employees, child care workers and food delivery workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State residents who have been exposed to COVID-19 or think they might have been can now take an at-home saliva test free of charge. The state will send Vault Health saliva tests to residents who have been exposed, think they’ve been exposed or want to use the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention method of ending quarantine with a negative test. The test can be ordered through the South Dakota Department of Health website. Vault Health requires a telemedicine Zoom consult to watch the user take the saliva sample. The sample can then be sent to the lab, located in Minnesota, with a prepaid UPS package. Results should be available in 24 to 48 hours after the sample arrives at the lab. The test is free and can be ordered more than once if COVID-19 symptoms surface. The South Dakota Department of Health website also offers a COVID-19 quarantine guideline calculator and COVID-19 risk calculator.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Shelby County health officials said Thursday that inspectors visiting restaurants and other businesses to ensure they are complying with coronavirus-related rules have received threats of violence and are being accompanied by police officers as they make their rounds. The county sends inspectors to businesses to check that they are following regulations, such as employees wearing masks, proper social distancing, and closing times. Police officers are going with the inspectors after some received racial slurs and threats of violence, said Dr. Bruce Randolph, the county’s chief health officer. “We’re not out to just close businesses,” Randolph said Thursday. “We’re out to protect the public’s health.” Memphis officials also say health care facilities are seeing a shortage of nurses and other staff. Doug McGowen, the city’s chief operating officer, has put out a call for people with medical training and experience, such as retirees, those who are working administrative jobs, or those employed outside the health care field to contact the Tennessee Medical Reserve Corps if they are willing to help ease the staffing shortage.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston-area authorities have announced a new task force to combat a more than 30% rise in road rage incidents this year, an increase that officials are blaming in part on the stress of the pandemic. The rise in road rage incidents coincides with an overall increase in violent crime in Houston during the public health and economic crisis, including a homicide rate that could be the city’s highest in nearly 30 years. “We’re not psychologists here at the Houston police department … but we do know that COVID has had an impact on the collective psyche of the American people,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said. More than 200 road rage incidents in which someone was shot have occurred during the first 10 months of this year, compared to 150 during the same period a year ago, Acevedo said. Six of these road rage incidents this year have resulted in murder. “This year has been very difficult, and there’s been a lot of loss both in our community and our nation, and we shouldn’t be compounding that suffering with unnecessary carnage on our roadways,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Scenes reminiscent of an early-pandemic summer have returned to Zion National Park, with rangers regularly closing the road into the park’s main canyon due to overcrowding. Nearly every day since the park’s shuttle system closed for the season Nov. 30, the popular Scenic Drive roadway has filled with cars before noon, forcing officials to close the gates to ease the traffic and prevent illegal parking. During the early summer when there was no shuttle service due to COVID-19 precautions, the scenic drive was packed with cars filling up parking lots in order to hike The Narrows. So when the shuttle opened in July this year, required tickets sold out almost immediately and remained in high demand through the end of the season. However, when the gate is down, there is no passage through the canyon, in contrast to past years when park rangers have occasionally let people by to just drive through when the canyon is full. The Scenic Drive will remain open to private vehicles and commercial shuttles through Dec. 24, when it will close for shuttle operation until Jan. 2, 2021. Throughout the winter season, biking and hiking up the canyon are still permitted.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A legislative panel considering how the state should spend the remaining federal coronavirus relief money has approved about $3.1 million of the administration’s $24 million worth of proposals but needs more information and time to decide on the rest. The money must be allocated by Dec. 30, or it goes back to the federal government. The Legislative Joint Fiscal Committee voted 9-1 on Wednesday to turn down reallocations for grants and hazard pay proposals, including a $10 million addition to an existing grant program for non-food and hospitality businesses, the Bennington Banner reports. Secretary of Administration Susanne Young and Economic Development Commissioner Joan Goldstein warned the committee the administration’s ability to process grants and issue checks becomes more difficult as time runs short and the holidays approach. Lawmakers including Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, however, said the proposals were given to them on short notice without enough background for them to consider.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam announced new measures to combat the coronavirus Thursday that include a stricter mask mandate and a curfew that will requires most Virginians to stay at home between midnight and 5 a.m. The executive order is set to take effect Monday and will also reduce the state’s cap on public gatherings from 25 people to 10. Northam is expanding the state’s long-standing mask requirements to include outdoor areas where social distancing isn’t possible and all indoor areas shared with others, except for households. The current mask mandate requires only that masks be worn in indoor public settings. The new mandate does not apply to children under 5. The order will be in place through the end of January. Asked why he chose midnight to 5 a.m. for a curfew, Northam said it was “common sense.” “I’ll also say something that my parents taught me when I was younger, and that is nothing good happens after midnight,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. He added that the state will be stepping up enforcement efforts against businesses that “flout” coronavirus-related restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: With an additional 49 deaths reported Wednesday, the death toll from the coronavirus in the state has surpassed 3,000, according to health officials. Since the pandemic began, 3,016 people in Washington have died from the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the state Department of Health. The total number of confirmed cases in the state is now nearing 190,000, officials said. Health officials also reported that a total of 11,996 people have been hospitalized in the state because of the virus, including 155 new hospitalizations as of Tuesday. Also on Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections reported 740 cases among the approximately 1,900 inmates at the Airway Heights Corrections Center near Spokane. The prison had just seven cases last week, The Spokesman-Review reports. “The humanity of what’s going on here is decaying faster and faster every day,” inmate Tobin Sather told the newspaper. He’s had two showers in the past 15 days and hasn’t had a single change of clothes in that time. For six days, the room’s temperature was hovering around 55 degrees after the heating system broke down, Sather said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University’s first virtual commencement ceremonies are this weekend, celebrating both recent graduates and those who completed their degrees earlier in the pandemic, and will be livestreamed at https://livestream.com/marshallu. The ceremony for spring 2020 graduates will be at 9 a.m. Saturday. Marshall alumna Jennifer Leslie Wells is the keynote speaker. She is the senior regional organizer for Community Change and Community Change Action, a national organization that strengthens social change from the ground up, Marshall said. The second ceremony, for summer 2020 and winter 2020 graduates, will be at noon Saturday. Professor Dan Hollis, recipient of the university’s Dr. Charles E. Hedrick Outstanding Faculty Award, will be the guest speaker. Jazz great Ellis Marsalis Jr., whose namesake jazz piano competition has been held at Marshall, will be awarded a posthumous honorary degree, to be accepted by his son, Ellis Marsalis III, by video during the second ceremony. Robert Simpson, former interim dean of the Lewis College of Business, will receive an honorary degree during the morning ceremony.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Legislature’s top Republicans have signaled they want oversight of how Democratic Gov. Tony Evers divvies up any future federal pandemic relief money and distributes vaccines. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and incoming Senate Majority Leader Devin LaMahieu said during a conference call with Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce on Wednesday that they believe Evers is making too many unilateral decisions on how to respond to COVID-19 without any public input. They said legislative oversight of federal aid and vaccine distribution would create transparency. Evers rejected suggestions of legislative oversight Thursday, saying having more than 100 lawmakers figuring out who gets a vaccine first “doesn’t pass the smell test.” “We need to make decisions in a timely manner,” he said. The Republican leaders also said they want to restore a one-week waiting period for unemployment benefits that Evers and the Legislature suspended in April. They said unemployment has subsided since then, and the state shouldn’t provide incentives for people to stay home and not work.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The University of Wyoming has banned new ticket sales to home sporting events until at least 2021 after new statewide public health orders imposed by Republican Gov. Mark Gordon went into effect Wednesday. The university said no new tickets will be sold until at least Jan. 8. There will be no additional ticket sales for two upcoming home games scheduled this week, but fans who bought tickets before noon Tuesday will still be allowed to attend. The new state orders were implemented in response to the recent spike in statewide coronavirus cases. The state reported 128 deaths from the coronavirus in November, the most in a single month since the pandemic began. The new measures imposed a statewide mask mandate in most public settings and limited indoor gatherings to 10 people if social distancing is not possible. Up to 250 people are allowed to gather outdoors as long as attendance does not exceed 50% of the capacity of venues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/11"}]}

Wonder and Franklin, who died in 2018, each have had 20 songs top the chart.\n\nOf Drake’s 21 No. 1 hits on the R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart, 12 include him in the leading role, including “God’s Plan,” “In My Feelings,” “Hotline Bling,” “Hold On, We’re Going Home” and “Best I Ever Had,” his first major hit released in 2009. Nine of his No. 1 successes are songs he co-starred on, including “Work” with Rihanna, “Moment 4 Life” with Nicki Minaj, “Fall for Your Type” with Jamie Foxx and “I Invented Sex” with Trey Songz.\n\nEarlier this year, 34-year-old Drake made Billboard chart history when he set a new record for most songs on the Hot 100 chart — Billboard’s main songs chart that includes all music genres.\n\nAt the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, Drake broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins. He won 12 awards at the show in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).\n\nDrake turned up the love for his mom with his heartfelt speech when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott.\n\nHe looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.\n\n“I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out.

If he reaches this industry pinnacle, he'd be the first artist to simultaneously debut a song atop the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Song chart, according to a video Combs posted Wednesday asking fans to support his run for Nashville history.\n\nIf it bows in the top slot, \"Forever After All\" would be the 45th song in Billboard history to debut at No.1 on the Hot 100, according to the trade publication, and first from a country artist since Carrie Underwood released her post-\"American Idol\" single \"Inside Your Heaven\" in 2005 (country radio programmers however didn't set sights on Underwood until her next single, \"Jesus, Take The Wheel\").\n\nCombs wants to \"go down swinging\" as he faces off with a new single from pop powerhouse Ariana Grande and lingering hits from 24kGoldn, Cardi B with Megan Thee Stallion, Drake and Nashville's hitmaking newcomer Gabby Barrett.\n\nListen to Ariana Grande's new single, 'Positions,' from anxiously awaited sixth album\n\n\"We're in one of these rare situations that I don't know if we'll ever be in again,\" Combs told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, this week. \"I'd like to just go down swinging, I think. If we're there I'm not gonna not put my best foot forward. That's just kinda the guy that I am.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I think we're punching above our weight class a little bit. I figured let's throw one more haymaker at 'em and see if it lands.\"\n\nThe song — a heartfelt midtempo love story released weeks after Combs tied the knot longtime girlfriend Nicole Hocking — comes off \"What You See Ain't Always What You Get,\" a 23-song deluxe album released last week in follow-up to his 2019 record \"What You See Is What You Get.\"\n\nCombs first teased the song on TikTok in August, belting the grizzled lyrics \"They say nothin' lasts forever/ But they ain't seen us together/ The way the moonlight dances in your eyes ...\" in a teaser clip.\n\nThe song follows \"Beautiful Crazy\" and \"Better Together\" in a line of first-person love stories that aided in Combs earning his spot among Nashville's top entertainers.\n\n\"You could write a generic love song, and not to say it couldn't be done, but my wife's impact on my life has weighed heavily on the outcome of these songs,\" Combs said. \"These songs wouldn't exist without her. I don't think I would've been in that headspace -- or been comfortable saying those kind of things -- without going through that.\"\n\n'I heard a YES':Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are engaged\n\nCombs \"couldn't of imagined this level of response\" to the song, he said. It earned nearly 11 million plays on Spotify since debuting last week, and the new deluxe album set a record on the streaming platform for most first-day plays from a country release.\n\nMoreover, \"Forever After All\" reached No. 1 on Apple Music's Daily Top 100: Global Songs chart and set a record for most first-day streams from a country song on the competing digital platform.\n\nBillboard calculates Hot 100 position via a combination of U.S. streaming, radio and sales data. The chart debuts Top 10 songs each Monday.\n\n\"All I can ever hope out of a song is somebody finds a connection to it that's special to them,\" Combs said. \"'Even Though I'm Leaving' is a song I've put out that people have found a piece of their own persona stories in. This song is similar to that, just in a different emotional range.\"\n\nHe recorded a handful of deluxe tracks in June, including country quarantine anthem \"Six Feet Apart\" and \"Without You,\" a collaboration with ace Nashville songwriter-fiddle player Amanda Shires.\n\n\"Forever After All\" was the oldest song in Combs collection of new cuts — \"I'm always a fan of having one in your back pocket,\" he said. He wrote it around January 2019, after moving into a new Tennessee home.\n\n\"I always wanna put out something I feel is worth people spending their money on,\" Combs said of his new release. \"I've never been a cash grab guy. ... That's never case. I think it's some of the strongest stuff that we've put out.\"\n\nSince 2016, Combs has launched his first nine inescapable radio singles (could a country music fan tune in anywhere last year and not hear his blasting \"Long. Neck. Ice. Cold.\" chorus in \"Beer Never Broke My Heart\" or the ready-for-any-wedding slow dance groove of \"Beautiful Crazy\"?) to top the Billboard Country Airplay chart\n\nHe's the only solo artist to send his first nine singles to No. 1 of the all-important country chart, and it's not even close. Clint Black sent his first four singles to top of the country chart during the height of his influential 1989 \"Killin' Time\" album cycle.\n\nHe'll take this monumental momentum into the CMA Awards next month, where Combs competes for Entertainer of the Year.\n\n\"You think people love it and you hope that they do ... and they do,\" Combs said. \"I'm just thankful for that.

But we only have 10 slots and one winner (for each category).”\n\nGrammys 2022: Check out the nominees\n\nMore Grammys: What to know about Jon Batiste\n\nAmong the notable snubs and surprises:\n\nGrammys 2022 snubs\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nDespite a guest list featuring Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett, Dua Lipa and Billy Idol, Cyrus’ seventh studio album, “Plastic Hearts” was blanked. Maybe voters didn’t cotton to her valentine to the ’80s, which is a shame. The release not only brims with Cyrus’ passion for the era but singles “Prisoner” (with Dua Lipa) and “Angels Like You” (featuring a co-write with Ryan Tedder) exemplify her ability to marry authenticity with rock charm.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly\n\nHis fifth studio album, \"Tickets to My Downfall,\" established Kelly as a pop-punkster who formally ditched his hip-hop roots. Still, his slick, guitar-fronted anthems didn't warrant a single nod. But between his ongoing musical partnership with Blink-182's Travis Barker and a hit rock single with \"Papercuts,\" from his upcoming \"Born with Horns\" album, MGK should have a reason for future Grammy consideration.\n\nDrake\n\nPrepare for another round of Drake vs. Kanye. The latter scored an album of the year nod for his much-tinkered with “Donda.” But Drake, despite breaking Spotify records, becoming the eighth artist in Billboard history to earn 10 No. 1 albums with “Certified Lover Boy” and outselling Ye with first-week sales, was only recognized for best rap album and best rap performance (“Way 2 Sexy” with Future and Young Thug). The Weeknd would like a word.\n\nBTS\n\nWe’ll acknowledge that “Butter” isn’t as hearty a slice of pop perfection as its predecessor, “Dynamite.” But it’s still a blissfully fun contribution from the K-pop superstars – not to mention the song of summer that broke a record on Spotify’s global chart for biggest song debut in the platform’s history. So only one nod for best pop duo/group performance? The BTS Army would like a word.\n\nMore awards: Brutally honest reviews of AMAs performances\n\nMegan Thee Stallion\n\nA nomination for best rap performance (“Thot S---”) is acceptable, but the most recent best new artist winner had every reason to expect that her debut album, “Good News,” would earn a few back slaps. The critically acclaimed release bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart, spawned the platinum singles “Body” and “Cry Baby” (with DaBaby) and pushed Megan further into the conversation of notable current female rappers.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nThe double Grammy-winner released “Positions” to reasonable acclaim as she continued to push a sound that mingled pop with R&B and trap. Though the album leaned more heavily on breathy ballads of seduction rather than club thumpers, it still earned her a No. 1 single with the title track, which landed a Grammy nod for best pop solo performance. The album will also compete for best pop vocal album, but there was an assumption it would warrant a bigger Grammy spotlight.\n\nLorde\n\n“Solar Power” is among the works that earned Jack Antonoff his producer of the year nomination, but as for the artist herself? MIA this year. While “Solar Power” wasn’t as adored as her 2013 debut “Pure Heroine” or 2017’s “Melodrama,” it signified a stylistic shift that usually appeals to the Grammy crew. Lorde has called “Solar Power” her “weed album” due to the songs being steeped in hazy psychedelic pop and sparser instrumentation than her past work. Apparently, voters preferred her in the clubs.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nAs we know from her “Miss Americana” documentary, the album of the year category is the one that Swift covets the most, so no doubt she’s pleased with “Evermore” landing among the year’s heavyweights. But whither “Willow,” which she performed as part of a medley at this year’s Grammy ceremony? Or “No Body, No Crime,” which returned Swift to her country radio roots? The omissions make Swift's album nod seem obligatory, which it certainly is not.\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nRecording Academy honcho Mason confirmed the embattled country singer was eligible to be nominated (“As long as the requirements meet our standards as far as date and genre, we don’t decide who is eligible,” Mason told USA TODAY). But despite the massive commercial success of “Dangerous: The Double Album,” and hit singles “Sand in My Boots,” “7 Summers” and “More Than My Hometown,” Grammy voters didn’t acknowledge Wallen, who was caught on camera uttering a racial slur in February.\n\nAlicia Keys, Kacey Musgraves, Lizzo\n\nOne year you’re a Grammy darling and the next cycle, a distant memory. Well, not completely. Keys, who has earned an impressive 15 Grammys (amid 29 nominations), popped up only in the best immersive audio album category (recordings released on formats such as DVD-Audio, Atmos and Blu-Ray) for “Alicia” and shares a record of the year nod not for her solo work, but “A Beautiful Noise,” which she performed with Brandi Carlile on “Every Vote Counts: A Celebration of Democracy” (it’s also on the digital version of “Alicia”).\n\nMeanwhile, former album of the year winner Musgraves, whose “Golden Hour” garnered an armload of trophies at the 2019 ceremony between the general and country categories, only nabbed a bit of recognition for “Camera Roll” (best country song and best country solo performance), from her current album (aka \"the divorce one\"), “Star-Crossed.”\n\nAs for Lizzo, she’s just a year removed from scoring her first three career Grammys, but her 2021 single with Cardi B, “Rumors,” didn’t merit any attention.\n\nGrammys 2022 surprises\n\nJon Batiste\n\nFaithful viewers of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” are well-aware of Batiste’s nimble musicianship with his band, Stay Human. But even with the jazz/R&B trailblazer’s sterling resume, his 11 nominations – the most among any artist this year – his isn’t a name expected among the album of the year (“We Are”) and record of the year (“Freedom”) lineups. It’s been a celebratory period for Batiste, who snagged an Academy Award in 2021 for best original score for “Soul.” Despite three previous Grammy nominations, he has yet to win. But with his current multiple nominations spread across jazz, R&B, American roots and classical categories, that will likely change in January.\n\nABBA\n\nWe’re the first to agree that ABBA’s absence among Grammy winners is blasphemous. But we’re also rational enough to realize that while their ’70s and ’80s output – “Mamma Mia,” “Waterloo,” “Dancing Queen” “The Winner Takes It All” – was undoubtedly deserving of awards praise, the single “I Still Have Faith In You,” from the group’s first album (“Voyage”) in 40-plus years, is an odd inclusion for record of the year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/10/14/pooh-shiesty-arrest-trial-life-in-prison-memphis-rapper/6096564001/", "title": "Pooh Shiesty: Memphis rapper faces life in prison in Florida case", "text": "Memphis rapper Pooh Shiesty started the year as one of hip-hop’s hottest new artists, but after a series of arrests he’s now facing the possibility of life in prison.\n\nShiesty — real name Lontrell Williams — has been jailed in Florida since July on charges related to an October 2020 incident where he was allegedly involved in the robbery and shooting of two men outside a hotel in Miami-Dade County.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal indictment, which carry a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His trial is set to begin Oct. 25.\n\nThe Commercial Appeal reached out to Shiesty's attorneys and record label for comment, but did not receive a response.\n\nHere are five things to know about Shiesty’s career and his legal troubles.\n\nRising rapper: 'Shiesty Season' is here\n\nChosen by Spotify's \"Rap Caviar\" as one of the \"10 Artists to Watch in 2021,\" the 21-year-old Pooh Shiesty became the latest young Memphis rap sensation, hitting the Billboard Hot 100 and Emerging Artist charts and making Rolling Stone's \"Breakthrough 25\" rankings. He was handpicked by rapper-mogul Gucci Mane to sign to his The New 1017 label and released his \"Shiesty Season\" mixtape earlier this year.\n\nRaised around South Memphis' Cane Creek Apartments, Shiesty is a second-generation Memphis rapper. His father founded the Bluff City label Mob Ties Records and rapped under the name Mob Boss, steeping him in the family business from a young age.\n\nShiesty got his start with a group of friends known as Choppa Gang. After a couple years away from Memphis, living with his mother in Texas, Shiesty returned to the Mid-South and started focusing on his music. As part of the Choppa Gang collective — which also included Big30, Choppa T and K Shiesty — he first gained notice with the track \"Breaking News,\" released in 2018.\n\n'A GANGSTA'S PAIN':Moneybagg Yo thrills Memphis crowd at homecoming concert\n\nMEMPHIS RAP:Yo Gotti becomes co-owner of Major League Soccer's D.C. United\n\nOn the heels of \"Breaking News,\" Shiesty began to develop a major underground buzz with performances on tracks like \"Hell Night\" (featuring Big30), \"Day One\" and \"Choppa Talk.\" Further fame followed in 2019 with \"Shiesty Summer\" released that August. The track would go viral, with the YouTube video for the song eventually getting close to 10 million views. His numbers would grow exponentially with the anthemic follow-up \"7.62 God,\" which would further put Shiesty on the music biz map.\n\nIn spring 2020, fate would intervene in the form of Grammy-nominated, platinum-certified rapper Gucci Mane. Gucci messaged Shiesty on Instagram, and in short order offered him a record deal, specifically a chance to be part of his The New 1017 label venture with Atlantic Records.\n\nThe association with Gucci quickly helped up Shiesty's profile, as did a series of further hits and notable collaborations including \"Monday to Sunday\" (featuring Lil Baby and Big30), a remix of \"Main Slime\" (with fellow Memphians Moneybagg Yo and Tay Keith), and his \"Back In Blood\" (a team-up with Lil Durk that would eventually go platinum).\n\nShiesty hit the upper reaches of Billboard this spring, placing at No. 4 on the albums chart with \"Shiesty Season,\" while his video for the single \"Back in Blood,\" hit the No. 1 spot on YouTube's U.S. video charts, and he made his national TV debut on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”\n\nPersonal loss: Pooh Shiesty's brother dies\n\nThis past February, just as he was celebrating his growing success, Shiesty lost his brother, fellow hip-hop artist TeeDa P. Born Tarrance Henderson, TeeDa P died on Feb. 28.\n\nWhile the family did not confirm the cause of death, various outlets reported he had been battling brain cancer and Pooh Shiesty had canceled a series of concerts just before his passing. TeeDa P had been gaining notice himself as a rapper since releasing a series of singles in 2019. His new album, \"Halftime,\" came out earlier this year.\n\nShiesty publicly mourned his brother and received messages of support from a number of fellow rappers, including Memphis-rooted superstar Drake.\n\nLegal troubles: Pooh Shiesty arrested in Florida\n\nShiesty's legal issues began in October 2020, when federal authorities allege he was involved in the robbery and shooting of two men outside a hotel in Miami-Dade County, Florida.\n\nThe FBI would eventually indict him and two others on charges of discharging a firearm during a violent crime, conspiracy and robbery under a law regulating commerce. Shiesty, along with Jayden Darosa and Bobby Brown, went to the Landon Hotel in Bay Harbor Islands, Florida, in October to purchase \"high-end athletic sneakers\" and marijuana, according to the criminal complaint by Miami-Dade FBI Detective Elio Garcia.\n\nShiesty arrived in a McLaren he rented from one of the victims and wanted to negotiate the car's rental as well, but during the transaction, he and Brown shot the men — one in the hip and the other in the butt, according to the court documents. The FBI said surveillance footage captured the shooting and after law enforcement spoke with the victims they identified one of the suspects as Shiesty.\n\nWhile leaving the scene, a Louis Vuitton bag — which had $40,912 in cash — fell out of the McLaren and, according to the complaint, Shiesty had posted guns and $100 bills on Instagram days before the robbery.\n\nLaw enforcement utilized the rapper's social media account and found the same bills in the Louis Vuitton bag were also in his posts, the court document said.\n\nShiesty was arrested but released from custody shortly after the incident.\n\nStrip club shooting: Pooh Shiesty arrested in Florida again\n\nShiesty was again arrested in June 2021 in connection with a Memorial Day weekend shooting of a security guard at strip club in Northwest Miami called King of Diamonds.\n\nAccording to a review of the affidavits in the case by Rolling Stone, the incident began when Shiesty “allegedly pulled a black semi-automatic pistol from his waistband and waved it around the King of Diamonds club in Miami… after he dropped some cash on the ground and purportedly worried patrons might grab it. As security tried to remove him from the building, he allegedly fired a shot, striking a security guard in the ankle.”\n\nAccording to his attorneys, Shiesty is facing a “mandatory minimum of 20 years” if convicted of the shooting.\n\nOn June 9, Shiesty was granted a $10,000 bond by a Florida judge on aggravated battery charges related to the King of Diamonds incident. But he was ordered to remain in jail until another judge ruled on his status in the Landon Hotel shooting.\n\nA few weeks later, on June 29, Shiesty was formally indicted in the Landon Hotel shooting. In early July, a federal judge ordered that he be held without bond. Shiesty has been held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami since then.\n\nMEMPHIS RAPPERS TO KNOW:These 5 pioneers of Memphis rap helped pave the way for city's current hip-hop renaissance\n\nMEMPHIS CONCERTS:'Legendz of the Streetz' tour date in Memphis pushed to 2022\n\nCourt case: Pooh Shiesty trial set for Oct. 25\n\nAccording to a recent report in Rolling Stone, Shiesty and his attorneys had petitioned the court to delay his trial to Dec. 6, in order to “properly build his defense against claims he was part of an armed drug-trafficking conspiracy dating back to 2019.”\n\nThe outlet notes that, “Prosecutors said they were fine with a delay but that conflicts would push the trial out to February. The feds also told the court they were reviewing ‘new allegations’ and a ‘potential superseding indictment.’”\n\nBut earlier this month, Shiesty and his lawyers did an about face in the strategy, and instead decided it was “in their best interest to proceed to trial” at the end of October. The first day of trial is set for Oct. 25 in the Southern District of Florida Court in Miami.\n\nIn the meantime, Shiesty’s friends and fellow rappers, including his longtime Memphis partner Big30, have rallied around him. Big30 recently released a track called “Free Shiest Life” and has posted support for his friend on social media with the hashtag, #FreeShiesty.\n\nCommercial Appeal reporter Dima Amro contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/12/11/top-moments-2020-music-garth-brooks-taylor-swift-billie-eilish/3884569001/", "title": "Top moments in 2020 music: Garth Brooks breaks Facebook Live ...", "text": "It's been one heckuva year, with the coronavirus pandemic upending seemingly every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn the music industry, album releases were pushed back and surprise quarantine tunes dropped.

I'm not mad ... I am however not giving up my name, my brand I worked hard for. #GodWillFightMyBattle #TheRealLadyA #LadyABluesSoulFunkGospelArtist #TheTruthIsLoud\"\n\nThe two sides initially said they'd work together to reach a compromise. But those discussions deteriorated and White and her attorneys reportedly asked for a $10 million payment, according to the band's publicist, Tyne Parrish.\n\nIn July, Lady A (the band) filed a trademark lawsuit against White in U.S. District Court in Nashville. \"Reluctantly we have come to the conclusion that we need to ask a court to affirm our right to continue to use the name Lady A, a trademark we have held for many years. It was a stirring in our hearts and reflection on our own blindspots that led us to announce a few weeks ago that we were dropping the word ‘Antebellum' from our name and moving forward using only the name so many of our fans already knew us by,\" the statement said.\n\n'Rockstar' named song of the summer\n\nTo the surprise of pretty much no one, DaBaby's \"Rockstar\" was crowned the 2020 song of the summer by Billboard.\n\nFrom Memorial Day to Labor Day, \"Rockstar\" (featuring Roddy Ricch) held the top spot for 13 of 15 weeks on Billboard's song of the summer tracking list. For seven of those weeks, it was also No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nWho is DaBaby?:Meet the chart-topping rapper behind 'Rockstar'\n\nLil Nas X's \"Old Town Road\" was 2019's winner.\n\n\"You can't overlook the star power of DaBaby and Roddy Ricch,\" Billboard senior director of music Jason Lipshutz told USA TODAY.

Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\" featuring Beyoncé clocked in at No. 4 and SAINt JHN's \"Roses\" rounded out the Top 5.\n\n\"Rockstar\" was streamed 514.6 million times this summer, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data. \"Blinding Lights\" was the most-heard song on radio with 1.2 billion audience impressions.\n\nKaty Perry announces pregnancy in music video\n\nPop superstar and \"American Idol\" judge Katy Perry revealed a baby bump in the final moments of the music video for single \"Never Worn White,\" her first song of 2020.\n\nDuring the dreamy video, Perry donned an elegant white gown fit for a bride and wore a literal bouquet of flowers while singing a love song to fiancé Orlando Bloom. The singer opened up about overcoming her apprehension to love and marriage in the ballad:\n\nI've never worn white, no\n\nBut I really wanna try with you\n\nYeah, I've never worn white\n\nBut I wanna get it right\n\n'Cause you really wanna say \"I do\"\n\n'Cause I do\n\nHer angelic glow was amplified when she cradled her stomach with both hands and sang, \"See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do).\"\n\n'Floating with love':Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom welcome baby girl Daisy Dove Bloom\n\nPerry gave birth in late August to a baby girl named Daisy Dove Bloom.\n\n\"We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,\" the proud parents said in a statement to the United Nations Children's Fund.\n\nEminem performs 'Lose Yourself' at the Oscars\n\nEminem?

Eminem skipped that awards show and missed out on performing it at the time.\n\n'Clean dozen in the books!':Eminem is 'not afraid' as he celebrates 12 years of sobriety\n\nOn Twitter, he quoted from the song's lyrics following the head-turning performance that left some fans wondering why he was on the Oscars stage.\n\n\"Look, if you had another shot, another opportunity...

It came from ...", "text": "Long before J. Cole, the popular rapper from Fayetteville whose verse is characterized by his flow of words, there was Bill Curtis and the Fatback Band.\n\nCurtis, another Fayetteville native, gets credit from many authorities and source books for recording the first rap record of the hip-hop era.\n\nThe release of that song, “King Tim III (Personality Jock),” actually predated the Sugarhill Gang’s multi-platinum seller “Rapper’s Delight,” though the latter is often cited as the first commercially released rap song.\n\nBoth “King Tim III” and “Rapper’s Delight” emerged during 1979, within months of each other, at the dawn of hip-hop.\n\n“It was a milestone,” Curtis said of his band’s historical hip-hop recording.\n\nCurtis, a drummer and percussionist, founded the Fatback Band in the early 1970s and continues to lead the current incarnation of his funk/dance franchise.\n\nWhereas “King Tim III” failed to cross over from any R&B activity into the mainstream, never cracking the Billboard Top 40, “Rapper’s Delight” became a worldwide smash.\n\n“I was out then, but on the B-side (of a single). It was the first recorded rap,” Curtis said of “King Tim III.”\n\n• • •\n\nShort in stature, Curtis speaks in a stately, melodious voice that has a mellow groove of its own. During an interview from his longtime home off Country Club Drive, he sat comfortably on a brown leather couch in his stocking feet. He sipped a root-based beverage that he despises, yet drinks on a daily basis for his kidneys.\n\nIn the kitchen, Terri Everett, his partner for a quarter-century, was baking an experimental pound cake without milk.\n\nMore than once, Curtis called out, asking when the cake would be ready. In the meantime, she offered him a sample of what was to come with a crusty cupcake made from the same mix.\n\n“I’m close to vegan,” he said. “I don’t eat that much meat. As you grow older, you learn to fall out of love for food.”\n\nHis love for music — especially, making music — has never waned.\n\nBased out of New York City, the Fatback Band started as a jazz-funk outfit before finding most of its success in the ’70s and ’80s with a string of rhythm-and-blues hits like “(Do The) Spanish Hustle”, “I Like Girls,” “Gotta Get My Hands on Some (Money),” “Backstrokin' ” and “I Found Lovin.”\n\nCurtis estimates that his band’s music has been sampled 35 to 45 times over the years. In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion, or sample, of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may be rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music.\n\nTwo years ago, Curtis and his band’s stock rose again when soul diva Chaka Khan’s single “Like Sugar” gained widespread attention. The song heavily sampled the Fatback Band’s 1975 funk-jam, “(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop.”\n\n“Chaka Khan did a remake of ‘Bus Stop,’ and that really opened up the doors again for me,” he said. “She took all the Fatback music from ‘Bus Stop,’ and she wrote some new lyrics to it. She called it sugar — ‘Like Sugar.’ And that really opened the doors. That opened up little avenues for me to tour, plus opened up some commercial and movie things.”\n\nCurtis, an only child who moved back to Fayetteville around 1997 to live with his elderly mother, continues to make his own music. These days, he releases singles only on his Fatback Records label.\n\nBorn and raised on Ann Street near the First Presbyterian Church in Fayetteville, Curtis is the son of a model/beautician and shoemaker.\n\nAfter starting with the piano, he switched to drums in 1943. Curtis joined the band at E.E. Smith High School, a program that produced a string of top-notch drummers during the middle of the century, with Curtis, Belton Evans, Herbert Drake and Ernest Moore at the top of the class.\n\nAll those stickmen would experience successful professional careers. Curtis credits the late Evans, who played behind some of the best in the early days of rock ’n’ roll, with teaching him to play the drums.\n\nAfter serving a stint in the Army, Curtis studied percussion at the Mannes School of Music in New York and at the New York College of Music.\n\nThe party music may pay the bills, but he’s a classically trained musician.\n\nEarly on, Curtis played as a sideman and recorded with a number of accomplished R&B and jazz artists, including Paul Williams, Big Maybelle, Bill Doggett, Sil Austin, King Curtis, Dinah Washington and Clyde McPhatter of Drifters fame. That’s him on drums on McPhatter’s 1965 recording “Live at the Apollo Theater.”\n\nMore recently, the Fatback Band has been playing the African World Peace Festival every other year in his hometown, and the group remains a strong draw in Europe. On Feb. 29, the band — under the name Fatback Band New Generation — was flying to England for a tour that includes dates in Amsterdam, Germany and The Netherlands.\n\nFatback has been booked for three music festivals in the United Kingdom, according to Curtis. “We’re like a local band in England,” he said, adding that his group’s music is popular in Japan, too.\n\n• • •\n\nThis first-class party band, always known to lock into a killer groove and work it to death, beat the Sugarhill Gang to the punch. Fatback was the first R&B act to acknowledge the populist form of rap art that first emerged from the streets of New York City more than four decades ago.\n\n“I heard people rapping up in the Bronx,” the 88-year-old Curtis said late last month. “In New York, they had street parties in the boroughs. We played all around New York. I was playing up in the Bronx and I heard the DJs up there — I think it was Grandmaster (Flash, another early rap artist) — they rapping and scratching on records and all that. You see, the Bronx was the birthplace of rap.”\n\nAround that same time, Curtis was in the studio recording the “Fatback XII” album. He said he had no intentions of recording a rap song, but once the album was finished, he failed to hear hit potential from any of the recorded tracks.\n\n“That’s the way I go — on instinct, on feeling,” he said.\n\nCurtis told his partner, Jerry Thomas, who has co-produced most of the Fatback Band catalog with him, that he didn’t think he had a possible hit on the disc.\n\n“‘We’ve got to do something different in there.’ And I had this one tune in there,” Curtis said, “which was kind of like an instrumental called ‘Catch the Beat.’ I said, ‘Jerry, let’s do a rap.’\n\n“First thing Jerry said, ‘Can’t nobody in the band rap. What do you mean, let’s do a rap?’ In the meantime,” Curtis added, “one of the roadies was in the studio with me and heard me say that. He said, ‘I have a friend that lives in the projects that can rap.’ I said, ‘Yeah, bring him in tomorrow night.’ And he brought in Timothy Washington. That’s his name. He brought Timothy in and I said, ‘Go in the studio and start rapping.’ And he went in there and laid it down in two shots. Bang! Then we changed his name to King Tim III.”\n\n• • •\n\nHip-hop’s roots as a musical phenomenon are subject to debate, although its roots as a commercial phenomenon are considered much clearer.\n\nThere is some debate in the music industry as to which record came first, but the general consensus is that the first rap record was by the Fatback Band followed by what has been called the “granddaddy” of rap records, \"Rapper's Delight.\"\n\nIt can be argued that rap on record had been around for years, with James Brown, Gil Scott-Heron and the Last Poets among those who recorded rhyme-like spoken word passages that have been likened to rap music at an earlier stage. Some music archivists even argue that such jazz scat artists as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Al Jarreau were rapping on record years before the arrival of the hip-hop era.\n\nStill, “King Tim III (Personality Jock)” — which first came out on the Spring Records label — marks the beginning of recorded hip-hop.\n\n“‘King Tim’ remains a killer blast of hip-hop, seamlessly mixing a slick old-school rap into the band's intensely funky blend of organ, energetic horn blasts and a relentless walking bassline,” the online All Music Guide says in its review of “Fatback XII.”\n\nCurtis always has claimed that his rap record came out roughly three weeks before “Rapper’s Delight.”\n\nYet, according to online sources, “King Tim III” was released March 25, 1979, months before “Rapper’s Delight” hit the streets on Sept. 16, 1979. Eventually, the Sugarhill Gang’s dance-groove track filled the airwaves and made the DJs’ rotation in the nation’s disco clubs.\n\n\"Rapper’s Delight,“ released on Sugar Hill Records, may not have been first, but it is credited for introducing hip-hop music to a wide audience. Likewise, it proved there was money to be made in hip-hop records.\n\nWhereas the Sugarhill Gang’s song was far more successful — with the New Jersey-based hip-hop trio producing the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit (it reached No. 36 on Jan. 5, 1980) on the American Billboard Hot 100 — the Fatback Band’s first rap release was issued as a B-side, or the flip side, of the 7-inch single, “You’re My Candy Sweet.”\n\nCurtis said he pushed for “King Tim III” to be the A-side of the single. But he was told that Spring Records refused to put up any money to market the song that label executives largely saw as a novelty, at most.\n\nThey didn’t think it would catch on with listeners.\n\n“‘You’re My Candy Sweet’ was me on the vocal,” Curtis said, before adding with his infectious laugh, “and I can’t carry a tune.”\n\n• • •\n\nClosing in on his 90th birthday, Curtis said he’s considering backing off as a percussionist with Fatback and taking on more of a management role.\n\n“I’m going to go until I drop,” he said with that high-pitched snicker of a laugh. “Our music — they’re just catching up to us. They’re just catching up to what we were doing. The DJs was raised on Fatback; the Djs was weened on Fatback.”\n\nHe figures approximately 50 albums have been issued under the Fatback or Fatback Band name. Those records were released on the labels Perception, Polygram, Spring and his own Fatback Records.\n\n“It’s my life’s work and it tells me where I came from,” he said. “I didn’t do it by myself. I was surrounded by good people and people on the same page I was on.”\n\nFollowing “King Tim III,” he said, Fatback recorded at least a couple more rap records. “After that,” Curtis said, “I got away from it. I had done rap. I try to tell people — don’t try to pigeonhole it. It’s just rap.”\n\n“It’s not a big deal to me,” he replied, when asked if it bothers him that he doesn’t always receive proper credit for making the first-recorded hip-hop era rap song. “I’m a record man. I love to make music. I know what I did. I know what I did.”\n\nStaff writer Michael Futch can be reached at mfutch@fayobserver.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/28/missy-elliott-talks-hits-she-wrote-aaliyah-beyonce-and-herself/2140241002/", "title": "Missy Elliott breaks down hits she wrote for Aaliyah, Beyonce, Ciara ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Missy Elliott, who has a history of writing and producing some of pop music's most creative and catchy songs, breaks down some of the hits she's written for herself and other stars.

Kelly-produced \"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number,\" when newcomers Missy Elliott and Timbaland were called in to work on ONE song with the R&B goddess.\n\nBut one song turned into eight, and \"One In a Million\" — the song and the album — was born.\n\n\"I was scared. I don't know if Tim was scared when we first played it because it was a different sound. It was a different way to attack records because people were really singing then; that world of rap-singing didn't really exist,\" Elliott explained. \"Because I wasn't really a singer like that, that's why I wrote like that, because I was a rapper, but I didn't know how to do a bunch of runs, so every record that I would attack, I would attack it like I'm rap-singing it.\"\n\nBut Aaliyah loved the song and appreciated Elliott and Timbaland's unique style.\n\n\"She had an ear and she knew what that music made her feel like. She was next level to understand that this is some next level (music). This is not just the sound that's going on right now — this is a new sound that is being created.

I know (Funkmaster) Flex was one of the first people to break that record in New York. ...It was a headache at first.\"\n\nMissy Elliott featuring Nas, Eve and Q-Tip, \"Hot Boyz\"\n\nAnother song Elliott said radio didn't want to play was \"Hot Boyz.\"\n\nThat may sound like a surprise since \"Hot Boyz\" set a record when it spent 18 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's rap songs chart. And since 1999, Drake and Iggy Azalea have been able to match the feat, but no one has outlasted Elliott's hit.\n\n\"I remember one of the stations in L.A. was the first to pull it,\" she said. \"And something happened, I can't tell you what happened, but whatever happened, it ended up back at the stations ... and it ended up in the Guinness Book of World Records.\"\n\nThe upbeat, hard-hitting song, which featured rappers Nas, Eve and Q-Tip, was one Elliott wanted to create not only for her die-hard female fans, but her male fans, too.\n\n\"I want guys to feel like they could ride around and listen to this because the beat was so hard. This beat feel like all the male rappers would want to get on this joint right here,\" she said.\n\n702, \"Where My Girls At?\"\n\n702's \"Where My Girls At?\" reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart in 1999, but Elliott said she initially wrote the anthem for TLC.\n\n\"Lisa (\"Left Eye\" Lopes) really wanted it, she really wanted that record, but I guess, if it's two against one (what can you do?)\" So I ended up giving that record to 702, which was cool because they were a group. I knew whoever had it, I wanted it to be going to a group.\"\n\nOf the biggest songs of 1999, \"Where My Girls At?\" was ranked No. 11 by Billboard. Elliott said she wanted women to feel empowered when they heard the fun track.\n\n\"It's almost like church — when you go to church, pastor is saying something (and you're) like, 'I swear up and down that message is for me.' I wanted to create something women could feel like, 'I could relate to this record.'\"\n\nMissy Elliott, \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\"\n\nElliott's debut single, \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly),\" goes down in history as one of the most creative, unique and impressive songs of all-time.\n\nBut Elliott said she created the song — and her first album — in an agreement to get her own label so she could sign artists and produce for them.\n\n\"Of course, those were my smoke days, you can tell by the first line. I just went in and I just said whatever I felt. Back then, there was no expectation, so it wasn't like I had to really think and say, 'OK, I have to make something better than what I did the last time. This was my first time going in, so it was like, whatever the music made me feel, I said it,\" she said.\n\nElliott and Timbaland finished her platinum-selling album, released in 1997, in just two weeks.\n\n\"That's how quick I wanted to hurry up and get my label deal. I would do songs five songs a day, so it was nothing. This was before people even knew who I was,\" she said.\n\nDestiny's Child, \"Confessions\"\n\nElliott knew Destiny's Child would be big before they blew up.\n\nShe worked on the song \"Confessions,\" from the group's sophomore album \"The Writing's on the Wall,\" which gave them their pop star breakthrough.\n\n\"They all had something special. And Beyonce, she knew exactly how to attack a record,\" Elliott said. \"When I heard Bey singing the verses, I was like, 'Oh they finna go far.'\"\n\nThe groovy song, about a woman cheating on her partner and confessing the truth, was one Elliott wrote specifically for the group after they reached out to work together.\n\n\"And it's funny when I think back on it because you rarely get women having to confess. It's always the guy who ends up having to confess,\" Elliott said. \"That was a different kind of twist for a female to be like, 'Look, I basically kicked it with Mike when you was gone, this went down and that went down.'\"\n\nMissy Elliott, \"Get Ur Freak On\"\n\nAfter Elliott created most of the music for her third album, \"Miss E... So Addictive,\" she felt like she was missing something. But Timbaland felt she was overanalyzing the situation.\n\n\"By this time, he's annoyed. He just happened to be in front of the keyboard and he starts just pressing the buttons on the keyboard but he when was doing it, he was mad,\" she recalled. \"He begins to create around this sound.\"\n\nMore:5 things to know about the viral 'funky white sister' who covers Missy Elliott's 'Work It'\n\nMore:AMAs: Twitter loses control after spotting Missy Elliott's 'funky white sister'\n\nIt kicked off the sound for what later became \"Get Ur Freak On,\" the album's first single and a monster hit for Elliott. It won the best rap solo performance Grammy, beating out Jay-Z, DMX and Nelly.\n\n\"I'm always a headache to Timbaland. He has to take vacations after we're done with my album because I stress him out,\" she said.\n\nThe eye-popping music video matched the song's wild energy and even featured cameos by Ludacris, LL Cool J, Eve, Busta Rhymes, Master P, Ja Rule and the late Nate Dogg.\n\n\"I miss those days. ...there was a time where you didn't have to be a feature on the record, you just support,\" she said. \"I tried to gather if people were in town like, 'Hey, come through' and they always showed up. I'm humbled by that.\"\n\nCiara featuring Missy Elliott, \"1, 2 Step\"\n\nMissy Elliott hadn't even met Ciara when she created \"1, 2 Step\" for the star.\n\nElliott was busy working her own music and hadn't heard Ciara's debut hit, \"Goodies,\" when she was asked to write a song for the budding singer.\n\n\"Back then people weren't really sing-rapping. Now that's the thing. But I wanted it to be where she still kind of rap-sings it. It allowed her to be able to dance, so she's not sitting there trying to do all these runs and sing and all that stuff, because you can't really get off when you trying to sing and then you trying to do the whole matrix thing going backward,\" she said, referring to Ciara's skilled dancing.\n\nThey finally met on the set of \"1, 2 Step,\" Ciara's second single which reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart. It became the fifth most successful song of 2005.\n\nThe two went to collaborate on more songs, even winning a Grammy together for \"Lose Control.\"\n\n\"When you have that kind of chemistry, you're going to always work together,\" Elliott said.\n\nMissy Elliott, \"Work It\"\n\nThe hook of Elliott's \"Work It\" features a famous line where the lyrics are played in reverse.\n\nShe said it was a happy accident.\n\n\"The reverse thing, that was a mistake. The engineer happened to hit something, and it just went backward, and I was like, 'Oh that's kind of crazy because it went backward on the beat. So, after that happened, I said, 'Yo, keep that in there and I'm going to write around it.'\"\n\nThe internet in 2002 went crazy — in today's world it would have been a viral moment — as fans tried to figure out what Elliott was saying in the song. Some thought it was a secret code or message.\n\n\"They thought I was saying all kinds of nasty stuff,\" she said. \"No, actually, I'm not, this time.\"\n\n\"Work It\" was the first single from Elliott's fourth album, \"Under Construction,\" which earned a Grammy nomination for album of the year.\n\nShe said Timbaland really challenged her to write something great on \"Work It.\"\n\n\"I don't record in front of anyone, so I went in another room and recorded, and I felt like a little kid going to their daddy with their report card.

It was kind of surprising once I found out what label money does to a song — just seeing it spread once the label got involved was amazing. It surprised me how fast it happened, but I already knew it was a good song.\"\n\n2. I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper) (feat. Mike Jones)\n\nPeaked at No. 5 in February 2006\n\nLuv was inspired by a night when T-Pain took his friend to a strip club for the first time. \"We got one girl to dance on him and he was just automatically trying to take her out of the club, pay for her tuition and do everything. The next couple days in the studio, everybody was still laughing about it. I started playing with GarageBand on my Mac and singing, 'I'm in love with a stripper,' and everybody was like, 'Yo, lay that down and we'll give it to (him) as a joke.' Then the label came in and we were going through some songs I had recorded. They heard the 'joke' and were like, 'This is the furthest thing from a joke. We're putting this out next week.' \" The fact that it became a hit \"threw me off. I was literally trying to make a bad song but it didn't work.\"\n\n3. Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin') (feat. Yung Joc)\n\nPeaked at No. 1 in May 2007\n\n\"This is the first record where I was trying to make a hit song. I was going into the studio consciously like, 'What do people like talking about? They like drinking and they like drinking with girls. What do you say to a girl to get her a drink?' I really went down the list. That was the first time I had ever done that. I didn't like doing that, because that's not really making music to me — that's making hit songs to get some money real quick.\" The track started simple and sparse, before he started adding harmonies and ad-libs to the verses. \"It got to where I actually liked the song. I was like, 'This is a pretty cool, dope song.' That's what really made me like it and then it became my first No. 1.\"\n\n4. Kiss Kiss, Chris Brown\n\nPeaked at No. 1 in November 2007\n\nKiss' music video shot on Florida International University's University Park campus in Miami. \"It was a two-day shoot, but I was super lazy at the time, so I only showed up for one day. Just watching how they were trying to split everything into two days was pretty funny because it was quite hectic and Chris would not let up on getting what he asked for. I gained tons of respect for Chris, he was really taking charge of that whole thing.\" Although Brown had already scored hits such as Yo (Excuse Me Miss) and Say Goodbye prior, \"it made me feel like Chris had grown up and was doing his thing.\"\n\n5. Good Life, Kanye West\n\nPeaked at No. 7 in November 2007\n\nT-Pain recorded a number of different hooks for Life, but \"it just wasn't sounding right to Kanye. He needed something different that was real anthemic and blew his mind right away. What ended up happening was, he made a composite of all the hooks that I did and made the hook out of it. Even the last part that I sing — 'Is the good life better than the life I live?' — that was one of the hooks, and he just put it at the end of the song and made it a bridge.\" When it came time to shoot the music video, \"it was a completely different song. I got to the shoot and (Kanye) was like, 'Do you want to listen?' And I was like, 'No, I've heard it.' He was like, 'No, you're going to want to listen to the song again before we start.' \"\n\n6. Low, Flo Rida\n\nPeaked at No. 1 in January 2008\n\nLow's hook was one of many that T-Pain wrote during a one-night writing session with Atlantic Records' A&R head Mike Caren. \"He gave me a bunch of beats and I just ran down the list and did a bunch of hooks. A lot of them turned into singles for Atlantic artists,\" including Flo Rida, then an up-and-coming rapper. The song's now-iconic refrain of \"Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans / boots with the fur\" was inspired, in part, by \"what all the girls were wearing. It was a rich white girl's uniform, it was so weird. Now it's like Uggs and yoga pants and Starbucks cups. It was just what I was seeing girls wear in the club and it kind of wrote itself.\"\n\n7. Got Money, Lil Wayne\n\nPeaked at No. 10 in September 2008\n\nMoney's music video depicts a bank heist, but \"what a lot of people don't know is that Wayne was shooting two videos at once. He was shooting (the A Milli video) out on the street and then it turned into the bank video. Everything about that day was super fun, it was just a bright and sunny day.\" Wayne and T-Pain are shown throwing cash throughout the video, a lot of which was real. \"I didn't feel comfortable because it wasn't mine — or maybe it was. Maybe that was my payment for the video. I asked for fake money, but they kept passing me real money, like, 'Yo, just throw this.' I was like, 'No, I'm not throwing real (expletive) money.' \"\n\n8. Blame It, Jamie Foxx\n\nPeaked at No. 2 in May 2009\n\n\"Jamie's a crazy dope writer. A lot of people don't know that, but it's insane how good he is. He came up with the hook and wrote the verses, and sent me the song. For some reason, it took me like 20 minutes to catch the chord progression. It was weird, I didn't know how to set my Auto-Tune and I was like, 'I don't want to call and ask how he set his Auto-Tune, that would be embarrassing.' So I just went through like 20 minutes of trying to figure out how I was going to sing this thing, because I didn't want to do the same rhythm as him. I just kept the faith and hopefully I was going to stumble on one of the keys of Auto-Tune I wanted to do this in. Once I found it, I recorded my verse, sent it to him,\" and Blame won a Grammy Award in 2010 for best R&B performance by a duo/group with vocals.\n\n9. I'm on a Boat, The Lonely Island\n\nPeaked at No. 56 in June 2009\n\nAfter T-Pain appeared on Saturday Night Live in 2008, Andy Samberg's comedy trio reached out to his team about collaborating. \"They sent us the song and I didn't know what the (expletive) they were talking about. I couldn't tell if the song was serious or not, so it kind of confused me. But once they said it was a Digital Short, then of course I complied. They wrote the whole thing, I went and put my voice on it, and sent it back.\" They later shot the video in Miami on a \"$30 million yacht, which was pretty cool. I'll tell you what, though — it was cold as (expletive) out there. We had to do these (aerial) shots and I wish drones had been popular back then, because they used an actual helicopter and that thing was spraying so much water on us. That was probably the worst video day I've ever been through.\"\n\n10. All I Do is Win, DJ Khaled (feat. Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross)\n\nPeaked at No. 24 in July 2010\n\nIf there's one thing you should know about Khaled, it's that he's persistent. \"He won't let you not do something. If he has an idea, it's going to happen real quick and on his terms. He showed up to my studio one night and I was like, 'Man, I'm doing stuff. I could be here eating steak and lobster, but I'm actually working. Let me chill.' In the next 20 minutes, he had someone show up with a ton of steak and lobster for the whole studio. It was pretty (expletive) impressive. I was like, 'I was just trying to make a statement, but thanks. I'm going to eat it.' \"\n\nAfterward, Khaled gave him a handful of beats to record Win's hook over, including one produced by DJ Nasty and LVM. \"I go in the booth and start doing ad-libs, and it was very confusing for him because I could hear it in my head and he couldn't. So he stopped the beat and was like, 'Yo, I don't think that's it. Let's try something else.' I was like, 'How about this? How about you get the (expletive) out of here and I'll call you when it's time to come back in.' He left, I finished the hook, and he came back in and was like, 'This is the biggest (expletive) hook of all time. This is an anthem.' \"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/08/29/ranking-michael-jacksons-no-1-hits-honor-his-60th-birthday/1112672002/", "title": "Ranking Michael Jackson's No. 1 hits, in honor of what would have ...", "text": "Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, has more No. 1 hits than most artists could ever dream of charting – combined. With 13 No. 1s – and one more to which he contributed vocals – Jackson leads the list of male artists with the most chart-topping hits.\n\nHis catalog has both legendary breadth and depth, considering Jackson was the first artist to score No. 1 hits in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s; and that during the ’80s alone, at his creative peak, he earned 10 No. 1s – more than any other artist that decade.\n\nYet for all his record-holding achievements, listeners may be surprised which of Jackson’s singles hit No. 1 and which songs missed the top spot. Bona fide classics such as “Thriller,” \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin,’ ” \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),” “Got to Be There,” “Smooth Criminal” and his “Scream” collaboration with sister Janet Jackson all failed to reach No. 1, while a good number of arguably lesser singles managed to reach the Billboard Hot 100’s peak.\n\nIn honor of what would’ve been Jackson’s 60th birthday on Aug. 29, revisit Jackson’s 14 songs that reached No. 1, and judge for yourself which were the best – and worst – of his most-popular songs.\n\n14. \"We Are the World\" (1985)\n\nOy. Where to start with \"We Are the World,\" the biggest charity single of all time, which recruited 46 singers to contribute a few words each to raise funds to combat poverty in Africa. Co-written by Jackson and Lionel Richie, \"We Are the World\" may have raised more than $75 million for the USA for Africa organization, but it's less a real song than a star-studded and hopelessly overblown PSA and doesn't deserve to be counted as an official Michael Jackson No. 1.\n\n13. \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" feat. Siedah Garrett (1987)\n\nThe first single from Jackson's \"Bad\" album is also its weakest one. There's nothing egregiously wrong with \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" – it's just that, when it comes to the many superior Jackson hits that missed the No. 1 spot, the song's inclusion on this list feels like a fluke.\n\n12. \"Ben\" (1972)\n\nAfter becoming the youngest artist to collaborate on a No. 1 track with the Jackson 5's charts-topping hit \"I Want You Back,\" Jackson scored his first solo No. 1 with \"Ben\" two years later. \"Ben\" is an earnest ode to a pet rat, recorded for the 1972 horror movie of the same name and written by composer Walter Scharf of \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\"-scoring fame. Like \"We Are the World,\" \"Ben\" is a Michael Jackson No. 1 single in name, but not in spirit.\n\n11. \"You Are Not Alone\" (1995)\n\nIn a more just world, Jackson's final No. 1 hit wouldn't have been “You Are Not Alone,” an overly sentimental ballad that’s more the style of its songwriter, R. Kelly. Considering Jackson recently charted in the top 10 with his unreleased vocals in Drake’s \"Don't Matter to Me,\" there’s still a possibility that another posthumous Jackson feature will replace it as his last charts-topping hit.\n\n10. \"Bad\" (1987)\n\nWith \"Bad,\" Jackson became the first and only male artist to chart five No. 1 hits from one album. Its title track is a testament to how formidable Jackson's singles catalog is: a perfectly strong track in its own right but one that barely cracks the top 10 of his own No. 1s.\n\n9. \"Say Say Say\" feat. Paul McCartney (1983)\n\n“Say Say Say” deserves an apology – or at the very least, a second listen – from every listener who writes off Jackson’s collaborations with McCartney as less than the sum of the two artists’ parts. “Say Say Say” picks up the pace while splitting its verses in two, handing McCartney the earnest opening notes while letting Jackson wail away on his appropriately funky melodies.\n\n8. \"Rock With You\" (1980)\n\nA favorite from Jackson's fifth solo album, “Off the Wall,” the breezy “Rock With You” only scratches the surface of Jackson and Quincy Jones’ collaborations to come.\n\n7. \"Black or White\" (1991)\n\nSome parts of Jackson’s racial-unity anthem hold up less than flawlessly in the current cultural climate, with lines like “I’m not going to spend my life being a color” that are probably in need of some unpacking. Yet “Black or White” actually bangs, its undeniably great guitar line vaulting the song to the best of Jackson’s ’90s No. 1s.\n\n6. \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" (1987)\n\nSandwiched in the “Bad” album run of singles between the swaggering title track and the more profound “Man in the Mirror,” “The Way You Make Me Feel” is proof that, even almost two decades into his career, Jackson could make an earnest love song as pure as his original Jackson 5 recordings.\n\n5. “Dirty Diana\" (1988)\n\nNeither about Princess Diana nor Diana Ross, Jackson's most sinister No. 1 single – also from \"Bad\" – is also one of his best rock songs. The spiritual successor to \"Billie Jean\" as another groupie cautionary tale, “Dirty Diana” is a reminder that Jackson, whose legacy isn’t exactly one as a sex symbol, could channel carnal danger just like the rest of his male pop star peers.\n\n4. \"Man in the Mirror\" (1988)\n\nA career-defining Jackson hit for its statement of self, from an artist with a notoriously conflicted relationship with his own image, “Man in the Mirror” is tragic in the way it foreshadows Jackson’s struggles to come – and triumphant as a pop achievement in its own right.\n\n3. \"Beat It\" (1983)\n\nFrom \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's immortal \"Eat It\" to Fall Out Boy's considerably less-immortal 2008 cover, there's a cartoonish aspect to \"Beat It\" that makes it prime for parody – or fools lesser artists into thinking they can appropriately do the track justice. Yet \"Beat It\" is a top-tier Jackson single because of how absurd, purposefully or otherwise, anyone else singing it sounds. Only Jackson can spit out the track's catchphrase and finesse lyrics like \"Showin’ how funky / And strong is your fight,\" all over a showy Eddie Van Halen guitar line and make it all sound like a pop classic instead of an ’80s fossil.\n\n2. \"Don't Stop ’Til You Get Enough\" (1979)\n\n\"Don't Stop ’Til You Get Enough\" is Jackson's first No. 1 hit that's not about a pet rat, and famously, the first song he claimed he wrote as a whole. And it's a stunner, six minutes of perfect pop music that courses with electricity from Jackson's opening howl.\n\n1. \"Billie Jean\" (1983)\n\nThis ranking was, really, a race for No. 2, because no Jackson single can legitimately hold the No. 1 spot other than \"Billie Jean.\" From its iconic opening drumbeats, the song marches in lockstep deeper into the paranoia-seized psyche of its young star. Not a single one of Quincy Jones' production flourishes is out of place, spanning rock and funk and disco and all anchored by a tortured performance by a 24-year-old Jackson that would remain his all-time career best.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/05/25/june-concert-guide-phoenix-tempe/84821264/", "title": "June concert guide for Phoenix: Brad Paisley, I Love the '90s Tour ...", "text": "Ed Masley\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nBrad Paisley plays Ak-Chin Pavilion to kick off a month that also features shows by Slipknot, Cage the Elephant and the hip-hop nostalgia of the I Love the '90s Tour with Salt-N-Pepa and Vanilla Ice.

Hey, it worked for Cage the Elephant. And these guys are just as effective as crafting a pop hook. PopMatters dismissed it as \"populist KROQ grunge for a new generation, though you get a sense these guys would see that as a compliment.\" That's like taking a bite of the tastiest pizza in town and complaining that it tastes like that pizza you had in the '90s.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, June 15.

The New Yorker said the new album \"combines the beauty and intelligence of his best earlier work with a new quality: warmth, generosity, possibly even contentment.\" These career-spanning shows will feature Jackson with a full band that includes longtime collaborator Graham Maby on bass, guitarist Teddy Kumpel (Rickie Lee Jones, Feist), and drummer Doug Yowell (Suzanne Vega, Ari Hest). The U.K. songwriter rose to fame with the 1979 success of \"Is She Really Going Out With Him,\" a New Wave classic included on Jackson's first album, \"Look Sharp,\" which Rolling Stone magazine later named to a list of the 100 best debuts of all time. Subsequent hits here in the States included \"Steppin' Out,\" \"Breaking Us in Two\" and \"You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want).\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, June 16.

In its place? A collection of heartfelt indie songs that haunt the atmosphere while tugging at the heartstrings, flirting with folktronica along the way. PopMatters says: “In general, you can tell that a lot of thought has gone into Delusions of Grand Fur.

They recently released the long-awaited followup to \"Pleasant Living,\" a fitting successor titled \"Celebrate.\" The vocals are as urgent as ever on the new one but the drums hit harder, which only adds to the sense of catharsis.

Their sound, in fact, is rooted in the music of the early Beatles and the British New Wave movement, which makes sense considering they formed in 1982. Enanitos Verdes are rockers from Argentina.

Three of the six original Body Count members have died since the release of that debut, and they've released four additional albums in the 24 years since becoming a target for everyone from Tipper Gore to Dan Quayle and a guy who starred in \"Planet of the Apes\" when he was almost cool.

Then it seemed he would join Twitter’s board. Late Sunday, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced the Tesla founder would not be joining the board, which could – and I stress “could,” as Musk and certainty don’t mix – mean he wants to buy the company outright, an option given his immense wealth.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/tech/twitter-elon-musk-timeline/index.html", "title": "Twitter takeover: A timeline of Elon Musk's bumpy road - CNN", "text": "Even by the standards of Twitter, a company that has known plenty of chaos and dysfunction in its history, the weeks-long effort by billionaire Elon Musk to buy the company has proven to be uniquely tumultuous -- and there's no clear end in sight.\n\nShould the deal go through, it would place the world's richest man in charge of one of the world's most influential social media platforms. The acquisition has the potential to upend not just Twitter itself but politics, media and the tech industry. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has repeatedly stressed that his goal is to bolster what he calls \"free speech\" on the platform, by which he means all legal speech that complies with local laws in the markets where Twitter operates.He has also said he would reverse Twitter's ban of former President Donald Trump\n\nBut the attempt by Musk, a wildly successful entrepreneur with a history of erratic behavior, to buy Twitter has been viewed with some skepticism from the start. On the day he made his offer, Musk said: \"I'm not sure I'll actually be able to acquire it.\" Some have questioned how he would finance the deal, especially as shares of, which he's partially using to back his financing of the Twitter deal, and the broader tech sector have declined in the weeks since.\n\nAfter Musk recently said he was temporarily pausing the deal so he could assess the amount of spam and fake accounts, it prompted speculation that the billionaire might be looking to renegotiate the deal -- or back out of it entirely. His actions in the days that followed only reinforced that thinking.\n\nHere is a look back at the many twists and turns in one of the most high-profile tech deals in recent memory.\n\nJanuary 31: Musk begins building up his Twitter stake\n\nMusk starts quietly buying up Twitter shares, building his stake in the company. But it would be months before he disclosed this fact to the public.\n\nMarch 14: Musk's Twitter stake tops 5%\n\nMusk's stake in Twitter tops 5%, but that fact is not disclosed until the following month. Musk was obligated to disclose his stake within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold, but waited 21 days to do so. During that time, he continued building up his stake.\n\nMarch 24: Asking whether Twitter should change\n\nThe billionaire begins to make pointed statements about the platform from his account. \"Twitter algorithm should be open source,\" he wrote , with a poll for users to vote \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nThe following day, Musk tweets out another poll to his followers: \"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\"\n\nA sign is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on April 27, 2022 in San Francisco, California.\n\nMarch 26: Musk reaches out to Jack Dorsey\n\nMusk reaches out to Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey to \"discuss the future direction of social media,\" according to a company filing later put out by the company. The two tech founders are known to have a bit of a billionaire bromance on and off Twitter.\n\nApril 3: Twitter leadership meets to discuss Musk\n\nTwitter's board and some of its leadership team meet with representatives from Wilson Sonsini, a law firm, and J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Musk joining the company's board, according a later securities filing . Dorsey is said to have told the board that \"he and Mr. Musk were friends,\" according to the filing.\n\nIn the meeting, the Twitter board discussed wanting Musk to agree to \"'standstill' provisions\",\" according to the filing. This would effectively \"limit his public statements regarding Twitter, including the making of unsolicited public proposals to acquire Twitter (but not private proposals) without the prior consent of the Twitter Board.\"\n\nApril 4: Surprise! Musk becomes Twitter's largest shareholder\n\nMusk is revealed to be Twitter's largest individual shareholder, with a more than 9% stake in the company.\n\nNews of the purchase sends shares of the social media company soaring more than 20% in early trading and kicks off a wave of speculation about how Musk might push for changes on the platform.\n\nApril 5: Musk agrees to join the board\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announces Musk will join Twitter's board of directors. \"Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,\" Agrawal says in a post on Twitter.\n\nAs part of the appointment, Musk agrees not to acquire more than 14.9% of the company's shares while he remains on the board. His term on the board is set to go through 2024, according to a regulatory filing\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) and former CEO Jack Dorsey in an undated photo.\n\nApril 10: Just kidding. Musk ditches the board\n\nAgrawal announces that Musk has decided not to join the board after all. \"I believe this is for the best,\" Agrawal writes in a letter to the Twitter team.\n\nThe reversal opens the door for Musk to pursue a greater stake in the company -- and frees him to tweet his many thoughts about the company.\n\nApril 14: Musk offers to buy Twitter and 'unlock' its potential\n\nMusk stuns the industry by making an offer to acquire all the shares in Twitter he does not own at a valuation of $41.4 billion. The cash offer represents a 38% premium over the company's closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become the company's biggest shareholder.\n\n\"I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,\" Musk writes in his offer letter. \"Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.\"\n\nApril 15: The poison pill\n\nTwitter's board of directors adopts a \" poison pill \" provision, a limited-term shareholder rights plan that potentially makes it harder for Musk to acquire the company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany.\n\nApril 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in financing\n\nMusk lines u p $46.5 billion in financing for the deal, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions and one equity commitment letter from himself, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe billionaire also reveals that he has not received a formal response from Twitter a week after his acquisition offer. He said he is \"seeking to negotiate\" a definite acquisition agreement and \"is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately\" — an apparent reversal from his statement in his acquisition offer letter that it would be his \"best and final\" offer.\n\nAlthough he is the richest person in the world, much of Musk's wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and some followers of the company speculate that it could be challenging for Musk to raise debt against the historically volatile stock.\n\nApril 25: Twitter agrees to sell itself to Elon Musk\n\nTwitter announces that it has agreed to sell itself to Musk in a deal valued at around $44 billion. At a conference later in the day, Musk describes his offer to buy Twitter in characteristically sweeping terms as being about \"the future of civilization,\" not just making money.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting that afternoon, Twitter employees raise questions about everything from what the deal would mean for their compensation to whether former US President Donald Trump would be let back on the platform.\n\nApril 29: Musk cashes out billions in Tesla stock\n\nFilings reveal Musk sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla stock in the three days after Twitter board agreed to the sale for an average of $883.09 per share. The filings did not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appeared to be raising funds to buy Twitter.\n\nTesla cars sit in a dealership lot on March 28, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nMay 4: With a little help from his billionaire friends\n\nMusk raises another $7 billion in financing for the deal. The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a filing\n\nMay 6: Musk's lofty goals for Twitter, revealed\n\nMusk aims to increase Twitter's annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, according to a New York Times report, citing Musk's pitch deck presented to investors. To achieve that lofty goal, Musk intends to bolster Twitter's subscription revenue and build up a payments business while decreasing the company's reliance on advertising sales, according to the report.\n\nMay 10: Musk says he would reinstate Trump's account\n\nMusk confirms what many have assumed for weeks: he would reverse Twitter's Trump ban if his deal to buy the company is completed.\n\n\"I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,\" Musk said. \"I would reverse the perma-ban. ... Banning Trump from Twitter didn't end Trump's voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it's morally wrong and flat out stupid.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, June 18, 2020.\n\nMay 12: A partial hiring freeze and executive departures\n\nTwitter confirms to CNN Business that the platform is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for \"business critical\" roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs ahead of the acquisition. In addition, Twitter says general manager of consumer, Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead, Bruce Falck, are leaving the company.\n\nMay 13: Twitter deal 'temporarily on hold'\n\nThe figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures. Musk tweets that the deal is on hold, linking to a Reuters report from nearly two weeks earlier, about Twitter's most recent disclosure about its amount of spam and fake accounts.The figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures.\n\n\"Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nShares of the social media site plummet after Musk's announcement, dropping more than 10% at market open. Two hours after announcing the hold, Musk says he remains set on purchasing Twitter. \"Still committed to acquisition,\" he wrote\n\nLater in the day, Musk says his team is testing Twitter's numbers and \"picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.\"\n\nMay 14: Oops. NDA problems?\n\nMusk tweets out that Twitter's legal team accused him of breaking a nondisclosure agreement when the billionaire revealed the platform's sample size for automated user checks is allegedly just 100 users.\n\n\"Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100! This actually happened,\" wrote Musk.\n\nMay 16: Poop emoji\n\nThe standoff over bot accounts continues as Musk exchanges a series of tweets with Agrawal over the issue. After Agrawal carefully explains how Twitter attempts to combat and measure spam accounts, Musk responds with a poop emoji.\n\nMusk follows up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. \"So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money?\" Musk asked. \"This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,\" he added.\n\nMay 17: Musk says Twitter deal 'cannot move forward.' Twitter disagrees\n\nMusk announces that his acquisition of Twitter \"cannot move forward\" until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts, claiming that the social media platform falsified numbers in filings. Without citing a source, he claims in a tweet that Twitter is \"20% fake/spam accounts\" and suggests Twitter's previous filings with the SEC were misleading.\n\nLater in the day, Musk posts a poll to his Twitter followers: \"Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?\" before calling on the SEC to evaluate the platform's numbers. \"Hello @SECGov, anyone home?\" Musk tweets, in an apparent attempt to get the regulator to look into the matter.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter says it remains \"committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.\" Later, the company says it intends to \"enforce the merger agreement.\"\n\nJune 6: A threat to walk away\n\nIn a letter to Twitter's head of legal, Musk threatens to walk away from his purchase of the platform, alleging that Twitter is \"actively resisting and thwarting his information rights\" as outlined by the deal.\n\nIn the letter, an attorney for Musk accuses the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on Twitter spam bots, stating that the lack of information gives him a right \"not to consummate the transaction\" and \"to terminate the merger agreement.\"\n\nJuly 8: Actually trying to walk away\n\nMusk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement . A lawyer representing him claimed in a letter to Twitter's top lawyer that the company is \"in material breach of multiple provisions\" of the deal over its alleged failure to provide all the data Musk says he needs to evaluate the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n\"For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to 'make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform,'\" the letter reads. \"This information is fundamental to Twitter's business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. ... Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.\"\n\nTwitter was not having it.\n\n\"The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement,\" Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday, echoing earlier statements by the company that it planned to follow through with the deal. \"We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\"\n\nJuly 12: Twitter sues Musk\n\nTwitter sued the Tesla billionaire in Delaware court in an attempt to force him to complete the deal.\n\nThe 62-page lawsuit, sprinkled with memes, tweets and a poop emoji, effectively highlighted the bizarre spectacle of the deal from the start. The company paints Musk as a non-serious potential owner — alleging at one point that he has \"disdain\" for the company, and at another saying, \"Musk's strategy is ... a model of bad faith\" — while seeking to compel him to become its owner. (Twitter's board has an obligation to its shareholders to try to see the deal through if they believe it is in their best interest. The dispute could also end in a settlement.)\n\nJuly 29: Save the date\n\nTwitter's lawsuit against Musk over his move to terminate their $44 billion acquisition agreement will go to trial on Oct. 17 and run for five days, a Delaware judge ruled.\n\nThe decision came after Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who is overseeing the case, previously ruled in Twitter's favor that the proceedings could be expedited and take place in October. Twitter initially pushed for an October 10th start.\n\nMusk's legal team had asked for the trial to take place in 2023. Twitter's legal team argued it was necessary to expedite the case in order to limit the \"harm\" to its business and to ensure the deal can be completed before Oct. 24, the \"drop dead\" date by which the two sides had previously agreed to close the deal.", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn", "Cnn Business"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/04/25/twitter-reactions-elon-musk/7444602001/", "title": "Twitter users have mixed reactions about Elon Musk buying app", "text": "Twitter will have a new owner.\n\nAfter days of speculation, the widely popular social media app confirmed Tesla CEO Elon Musk would be buying the company in a deal worth $44 billion.

It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter's serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, who was previously the company's head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter's leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk's attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk's claims).\n\nZatko was fired byin January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter's board and to help Twitter fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko's lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk's involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, \"We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.\"\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n\"Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,\" the Twitter spokesperson said. \"What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko's allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.\"\n\nPeiter \"Mudge\" Zatko was the head of security at Twitter. A well-known \"ethical hacker,\" Zatko also previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense.\n\nSome of Zatko's most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company's former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter's security problems to the company's board of directors. The company's executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company's security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko's back to have a third-party consulting firm's report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company's problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter -- so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko's tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter's FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company's security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits -- was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nThe claims I've received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate \"and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel's top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you've got a recipe for disaster,\" Grassley said. \"The claims I've received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.\"\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n\"If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,\" Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. \"Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action\" by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC \"to help the agency enforce the laws,\" and to gain federal whistleblower protections. \"The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge's decision, and in fact he didn't even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.\"\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n\"All my life, I've been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I've done that through the security field. That's my main lever,\" he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nJUST WATCHED Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world's most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known \"ethical hacker\" turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he'd been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998.\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company's employees — amounting to roughly half the company's workforce — access to some of the platform's critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as \"egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.\"\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection , Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company's platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the \"production environment.\"\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned \"it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did.... Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.\" Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees' individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nTwitter's flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company's 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko's disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter's engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter's employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter's live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko's tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko's statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter's existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter's security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users' private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter's central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining \"a comprehensive information security program.\"\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company's claims to the contrary, it had \"never been in compliance\" with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an \"anomalously high rate of security incidents,\" approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. \"Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,\" Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter's board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko's disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it's found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter's original 2011 consent order.\n\n[I]f there's a violation here — and that's a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC's $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n\"One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should've been named,\" Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. \"And if there's a violation here — and that's a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.\"\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko's allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter's existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter's FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company's level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko's firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government's intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November.\n\nLast year, prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter's chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal's suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal's suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\nThe fact that Twitter's current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter's effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\n\"The fact that Twitter's current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter's effects on U.S. national security,\" Zatko's disclosure says.\n\nZatko's report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens' data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko's disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform , an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company's long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers' remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter's figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter -- leaving all accounts that for some reason can't, for instance because they're known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko's disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko's disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter's head of site integrity that the company didn't know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company \"had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,\" in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company's value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I'm still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify \"bots\" because there isn't a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn't know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. \"The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform ... At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what's actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,\" he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms' rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company.\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter's ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko's allegations could provide ammunition to Musk's central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. \"Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I'm still performing that mission,\" he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Cnn Business Video John General", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside", "Cnn Business Portraits Sarah Silbiger For Cnn", "Sen.

First, here's some quick background:\n\nThe protests involve a minority of Canada's truck drivers, some far-right activists and a variety of other citizens. The demonstrations began in late January as a \"Freedom Convoy\" of trucks and other vehicles. The convoy then turned into an ongoing demonstration in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, whose mayor declared a state of emergency on Sunday. It has also sparked protests elsewhere and inspired plans for a similar convoy in the US.\n\nThe protests have been touted on right-wing US television station Fox and have been cheered by some prominent Republican officeholders and conservative pundits; organizers have raised millions of dollars . Former President Donald Trump even weighed in with a statement praising the protesters and denouncing Trudeau.\n\nThe convoy started after Canada began requiring truckers who cross the US border to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or have two-week quarantines upon returning home. The Canadian Trucking Alliance, the primary advocacy group for Canadian truckers, has opposed the protests and has said that more than 85% of Canadian truckers who regularly cross the border were fully vaccinated as of late January.\n\nFalse claims about the number of trucks\n\nOrganizers claimed in late January that the convoy had grown to tens of thousands of trucks -- even that the number was around 50,000 . Others repeated this \"50,000\" figure.\n\nTheo Fleury, a retired hockey star who's a frequent critic of Trudeau, said on Fox in late January that there were \"50,000 truckers\" heading to Ottawa. Rogan, who has been criticized for his show's role in promoting Covid-19 misinformation, said on the show in late January that the convoy involved \"apparently some insane amount of people, like 50,000 trucks.\" Even larger figures, like \" 80,000 \" or \" over 130,000 \" trucks, swirled on social media.\n\nFacts First: The number of trucks involved in the protest was never anywhere close to 50,000; such a number of trucks would have taken up : The number of trucks involved in the protest was never anywhere close to 50,000; such a number of trucks would have taken up hundreds of miles more road space than this protest occupied . Canadian journalists put the number of trucks in the hundreds in late January. Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters on January 31 that it was impossible to provide exact crowd-size figures but that he had \"heard\" numbers as high as 18,000 total demonstrators -- not just truckers -- present in the city at the peak of the protest on January 29. No credible source has reported that the number of participating trucks in particular ever approached tens of thousands, let alone \"50,000.\"\n\nPolice in Kingston, Ontario, a city through which a portion of the protest convoy passed, tweeted on January 28 that they had counted 17 full tractor-trailers, 104 tractors without trailers, 424 passenger vehicles and 6 RVs. The same day, Global News chief political correspondent David Akin tweeted that police sources had told him there were \"230 tractors / tractor-trailers & 725 personal vehicles from Toronto and Western Canada,\" plus 200 vehicles from the eastern provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (he added that there were an \"unknown\" number of others involved).\n\nRogan could not be immediately reached for comment. When Fleury was asked for comment about how he had repeated the false \"50,000 truckers\" claim on Fox, he emailed a reply in which he attacked CNN and the Trudeau government and said, \"Ever heard of a little thing called marketing??? It worked.\"\n\nFalsely captioned photos and videos\n\nNumerous social media posts put inaccurate captions on photos and videos of events that had occurred prior to 2022 -- such as truck demonstrations, other protests, even a parade in support of the Special Olympics -- to falsely claim these images were connected to the Canadian convoy protest.\n\nFacts First: One video that has been shared on various social media platforms was captioned to claim that it showed South Carolina truckers heading to Ottawa to join the convoy -- but it actually showed an August 2021 truck parade in support of the Special Olympics, USA Today : One video that has been shared on various social media platforms was captioned to claim that it showed South Carolina truckers heading to Ottawa to join the convoy -- but it actually showed an August 2021 truck parade in support of the Special Olympics, USA Today reported . A video of honking Brazilian truckers that circulated on Facebook was from a May 2021 demonstration in support of President Jair Bolsonaro, not a demonstration in solidarity with the Canadian truckers as some captions claimed, USA Today also reported . A photo of a massive protest crowd, shared in Twitter posts in both English and Spanish as if it were from Ottawa this year, actually depicted a 1991 demonstration in Moscow against the Communist government of the Soviet Union, Reuters reported . And another photo, which has been described in Facebook posts as a group of Amish people driving to support the convoy, is a shot of Old Order Mennonites simply going to church, PolitiFact reported\n\nEven billionaire Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk got in on the game, though without making an explicitly false claim himself.\n\nMusk, who has more than 73 million followers on Twitter and has expressed support for the Canadian protest, tweeted out an aerial image on January 30 that showed a long line of trucks on a road surrounded by snowy land. The image included the words, \"Taking a break from politics for a while. Here's a nice photo of trucks.\"\n\nMusk didn't say anything about where and when the image had been taken, but the replies to his tweet -- which generated more than 40,000 retweets -- showed that a significant number of people believed that it was a shot of the Canadian convoy this year, as some others on social media strongly suggested in their own captions.\n\nA false claim about police resignations\n\nPat King, who was listed as one of the regional organizers of the convoy and has been one of its leading online promoters, has more than 293,000 followers on his Facebook page . During a Facebook livestream on Sunday, which had been viewed more than 204,000 times as of early Tuesday afternoon, King claimed that \"50% of the Ottawa police force have all turned in their resignation today\" -- suggesting these supposed resignations had happened because the officers support the protests.\n\nThat claim quickly made its way to other social media platforms . British actor John Bowe tweeted on Monday: \"Reports that 50% of @OttawaPolice have tendered their resignation and Canadian Armed forces reportedly vow allegiance to the people.\" Bowe's tweet generated more than 11,000 retweets before he deleted it.\n\nFacts First: These claims were entirely false. Ottawa police spokesperson Constable Amy Gagnon said in Monday emails to CNN that \"there have been no resignations in relation to the Demonstration\" and \"all available officers are working.\" And the Canadian Armed Forces have not made any vow of \"allegiance\" in relation to the protests nor issued any dramatic statements of any kind about this issue. \"In short, no, we have not made any such comment,\" a military spokesperson said in a Monday email to CNN.\n\nKing, who has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and other false claims, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment on Monday. After CNN fact-checked Bowe's tweet on Twitter on Monday, Bowe tweeted to another Twitter user that \"I wish it were (true) but it is disputed. Apparently the reports I read were posted by an imaginative trucker. But we can dream.\"\n\nA false claim about the government and hotels\n\nRupa Subramanya, who has more than 128,000 Twitter followers and writes columns for the National Post , a conservative Canadian newspaper, tweeted on Sunday: \"I've heard from so many today that some Ottawa hotels have been instructed by the city/feds not to give out rooms to the protestors. The Marriott downtown apparently is empty but evidently all the rooms booked. Someone should really investigate if this is true.\"\n\nFacts First: Regardless of what Subramanya may have been told, the claims she amplified were not true. The employees who took CNN's calls at the downtown Marriott and five other Ottawa hotels on Monday said their establishments had not been given any anti-protester instruction by any government; Patrick Champagne, press secretary to Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, told CNN that the claim \"is categorically false\"; Alexander Cohen, spokesperson for Canadian Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino, called the claim \"ludicrous\" and said that \"no one from the federal government has done that\"; Steve Bell, president of the Ottawa Gatineau Hotel Association, said that \"to my knowledge there is no truth to this rumour.\" As for the Marriott in particular, it had rooms available at the time of Subramanya's tweet on Sunday evening and again on Monday evening.\n\nWhen CNN told Subramanya that the claims in her tweet seemed to be false, she said she was glad we had looked into the matter. She insisted she had herself made \"no claim\" and had merely issued a \"call for help\" for journalists to look into what she had been hearing from protesters, since \"frankly I've been working round the clock talking to people on the ground and so I haven't had the time or the opportunity to vet this claim.\"\n\nThe \"mainstream Canadian media should be fact checking these and debunking them if they're false,\" Subramanya said, though she herself writes for a national Canadian newspaper.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/10/fact-check-no-proof-zimbabwean-inventors-chargeless-electric-car/6104513002/", "title": "Fact check: No evidence that Zimbabwean inventor created a ...", "text": "The claim: A Zimbabwean inventor created a chargeless electric vehicle\n\nIn 2013, CEO Elon Musk founded Tesla, which has become the largest American seller of electric vehicles.

To be honest, I hadn’t until today,” wrote Victor Mukandatsama of Techzim. “The company will hold an open day to showcase technologies that they have been working on at the Bluffhill Industrial Park in Harare.”\n\nMukandatsama said the electric car project by Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso was \"another interesting development considering the scarcity of energy and power in Africa.\"\n\nThe promotional event gained a lot of media attention at the time from outlets such as South African news channel SABC Digital News.\n\nFact check: Post quoting Amy Coney Barrett and Greta Thunberg on climate change is true\n\nMedia outlet questions authenticity\n\nAll evidence that has been used throughout the years to support the alleged invention of electric car that needs no charge traces back to photos from the “Open Day” event.\n\nThe only images available on Saith Technologies' Facebook and Twitter page are from that event, and the account has been inactive since 2015.\n\nLeonard Sengere, editor of Techzim, told Snopes that one of its reporters attended the event and was given a tour of the \"inventions.”\n\n“The electric car and the generator were shown running and that was the extent of it,” Sengere said. “There was no chance for anyone to verify exactly what they were running on,” adding that the scientific community “largely just ignored him.”\n\nIn the days following the event, Techzim published an article debunking misconceptions about Saith Technologies' claims, including the electric car.\n\nTechzim reported the \"discovery\" used simple gel batteries of 220 volts into a higher output of 500,000 watts, making his claim \"advanced beyond the law of conservation of energy.\"\n\n\"We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist will put the claims to test,\" Techzim wrote.\n\nThe Associated Press and PolitiFact also previously debunked this claim in 2018.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim that a Zimbabwean inventor created an electric car that doesn't need to be charged is FALSE, based on our research. The claim stems from a 2015 event that included a variety of questionable fake inventions. There has been no evidence in the past five years that the car was made and the media outlet that reported on the event later published an article debunking Saith Technologies' claim.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Ukraine\n\nRussian troops are escalating their offensive in the south and east of Ukraine but are facing stiff resistance as they target the country's central and western regions, Ukrainian officials said yesterday. This comes as Russian forces took control of the Kherson City Council, weeks after first occupying the southern Ukrainian city. Russia also announced it will stage a referendum asking people to approve the \"independence\" of a new entity called \"the Kherson People's Republic.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move a \" sham referendum ,\" saying civilians have already shown \"their attitude toward the occupiers\" by protesting in occupied towns. Meanwhile, as the war enters its third month, Zelensky said Russia has fired more than 1,100 missiles at Ukrainian targets, in addition to \"countless bombs and artillery.\"\n\n2. Twitter\n\nTwitter said yesterday it will sell itself to Elon Musk in a roughly $44 billion deal. The agreement, which was unanimously approved by Twitter's board, is expected to close later this year pending approval from shareholders and regulators. In a statement yesterday, Musk reiterated his proposed changes for the platform, including his goal to bolster free speech. He said in a tweet yesterday that he hopes \"even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\" Many people are wondering whether Musk plans to restore former President Donald Trump's account , which was suspended early last year for violating Twitter policies against inciting violence following the Capitol Riot. Such a move could have significant ramifications for the upcoming 2024 US presidential election.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump says he won't return to Twitter even if he's reinstated by Musk Replay More Videos ...

Immigration\n\nA federal judge in Louisiana yesterday temporarily blocked the Biden administration from ending a Trump-era pandemic restriction on the US-Mexico border that allows authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries. The public health authority, known as Title 42, was on track to end on May 23, but this latest ruling may throw a wrench in the administration's plans moving forward. The decision to lift Title 42 has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike because border authorities say a massive surge of migrants would follow. More than 20 states had asked the court to block the administration from ending the restriction and last week asked the court to immediately intervene.\n\nJUST WATCHED Avlon: Title 42 'is not evidence of open borders, it is just the opposite' Replay More Videos ...

Since Friday, Beijing has reported a total of 80 cases. Although the caseload is still relatively low, authorities are not taking any chances, especially after seeing how fast the Omicron outbreak in Shanghai spiraled into tens of thousands of new cases.

The messages also reveal how Trump's family members reacted to the violence at the US Capitol during the insurrection.

Researchers have targeted 60 genes that make up the mammoth’s distinctive characteristics, and they will use elephant eggs or tissue.\n\nResearchers believe that if the mammoths can be created, they could revitalize grasslands in the Arctic. Colossal said Monday that the project could have “major climate change-combatting properties including carbon sequestering, methane suppression and light reflection.”\n\nLamm told USA TODAY that reintroducing woolly mammoths to the Arctic tundra \"will allow mammoths to trample the taiga and slow growing plants, fertilize the ground, uproot trees, and allow for grasslands to return, which in turn support more life.\"\n\nWoolly Mammoths:World's oldest DNA discovered in 1.2-million-year-old mammoth teeth\n\n'Completely preserved':Ice Age cave bear carcass found by reindeer herders in Russia\n\nResearchers hope to produce mammoth calves within four to six years, Lamm told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We are working hard to scale up not only our genomic editing capabilities but also artificial womb research that will support the development of hundreds and potentially thousands of woolly mammoths at the same time,\" he said.\n\nThe project is not new territory for Church, who is a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School and a core faculty member at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. For eight years, he has been leading a group researching methods of creating mammoths, The New York Times reported.\n\nColossal was launched with $15 million in funding, including investments from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who rose to fame after suing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe project has garnered concerns from other researchers. Victoria Herridge, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London, told the Guardian, “My personal thinking is that the justifications given – the idea that you could geoengineer the Arctic environment using a heard of mammoths – isn’t plausible.\n\n“The scale at which you’d have to do this experiment is enormous. You are talking about hundreds of thousands of mammoths which each take 22 months to gestate and 30 years to grow to maturity.”\n\nLamm noted that \"there have been some questions raised on whether the revival of the woolly mammoth can be done at the required speed needed to make a positive impact on the degrading Arctic ecosystem.\"\n\n\"We are confident that Colossal is up to this challenge as we have brought on world renowned scientists and researchers that are passionate about bringing the woolly mammoth back and successfully rewilding them into the Arctic.\"\n\nGareth Phoenix, a professor of plant and global change ecology at the University of Sheffield, also told the Guardian, “While we do need a multitude of different approaches to stop climate change, we also need to initiate solutions responsibly to avoid unintended damaging consequences.”\n\n“Mammoths are proposed as a solution to help stop permafrost thaw because they will remove trees, trample and compact the ground and convert landscapes to grassland, which can help keep the ground cool,” he said. “However, we know in the forested Arctic regions that trees and moss cover can be critical in protecting permafrost, so removing the trees and trampling the moss would be the last thing you’d want to do.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/17/gas-prices-rudy-giuliani-liz-cheney-tasmanian-tiger-resurrection-its-wednesdays-news/10329723002/", "title": "Gas prices, Rudy Giuliani, Liz Cheney, Tasmanian tiger resurrection ...", "text": "Gas prices are dropping.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n\n(CNN) Almost 100 years after its extinction, the Tasmanian tiger may live once again. Scientists want to resurrect the striped carnivorous marsupial, officially known as a thylacine, which used to roam the Australian bush.\n\nThe ambitious project will harness advances in genetics, ancient DNA retrieval and artificial reproduction to bring back the animal.\n\n\"We would strongly advocate that first and foremost we need to protect our biodiversity from further extinctions, but unfortunately we are not seeing a slowing down in species loss,\" said Andrew Pask, a professor at the University of Melbourne and head of its Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research Lab, who is leading the initiative.\n\n\"This technology offers a chance to correct this and could be applied in exceptional circumstances where cornerstone species have been lost,\" he added.\n\nThe project isa collaboration withColossal Biosciences, founded by tech entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard Medical School geneticist George Church, who are working on an equally ambitious, if not bolder, $15 million project to bring back the woolly mammoth in an altered form.\n\neverywhere except the Australian island of Tasmania. As the only marsupial apex predator that lived in modern times, it played a key role in its ecosystem, but that also made it unpopular with humans. About the size of a coyote , the thylacine disappeared about 2,000 years ago virtuallyeverywhere except the Australian island of Tasmania. As the only marsupial apex predator that lived in modern times, it played a key role in its ecosystem,but that also made it unpopular with humans.\n\nEuropean settlers on the island in the 1800s blamed thylacines for livestock losses (although, in most cases, feral dogs and human habitat mismanagement were actually the culprits), and they hunted the shy, seminocturnal Tasmanian tigers to the point of extinction.\n\noccurred shortly after thylacines had been granted protected status, but it was too late to save the species. The last thylacine living in captivity, named Benjamin, died from exposure in 1936 at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. This monumental lossoccurred shortly after thylacines had been granted protected status, but it was too late to save the species.\n\nGenetic blueprint\n\nThe project involves several complicated steps that incorporate cutting-edge science and technology, such as gene editing and building artificial wombs.\n\nFirst, the team will construct a detailed genome of the extinct animal and compare it with that of its closest living relative -- a mouse-size carnivorous marsupial called the fat-tailed dunnart -- to identify the differences.\n\n\"We then take living cells from our dunnart and edit their DNA every place where it differs from the thylacine. We are essentially engineering our dunnart cell to become a Tasmanian tiger cell,\" Pask explained.\n\nOnce the team has successfully programmed a cell, Pask said stem cell and reproductive techniques involving dunnarts as surrogates would \"turn that cell back into a living animal.\"\n\n\"Our ultimate goal with this technology is to restore these species to the wild, where they played absolutely essential roles in the ecosystem. So our ultimate hope is that you would be seeing them in the Tasmanian bushland again one day,\" he said.\n\nThe fat-tailed dunnart is much smaller than an adult Tasmanian tiger, but Pask said that all marsupials give birth to tiny young, sometimes as small as a grain of rice. This means that even a mouse-size marsupial could serve as a surrogate mother for a much larger adult animal like the thylacine, at least in the early stages.\n\nReintroducing the thylacine to its former habit would have to be done very cautiously, Pask added.\n\n\"Any release such as this requires studying the animal and its interaction in the ecosystem over many seasons and in large areas of enclosed land before you would consider a complete rewilding,\" he said.\n\nThe team hasn't set a time line for the project, but Lamm said he thought progress would be quicker than the efforts to bring back the woolly mammoth, noting that elephants take far longer to gestate than dunnarts.\n\nThe techniques could also help living marsupials, such as the Tasmanian devil, avoid the thylacine's fate as they grapple with intensifying bushfires as a result of the climate crisis.\n\n\"The technologies we are developing to de-extinct the thylacine all have immediate conservation benefits -- right now -- to protect marsupial species. Biobanks of frozen tissue from living marsupial populations have been collected to protect against extinction from fires,\" Pask said via email.\n\n\"However, we still lack the technology to take that tissue -- create marsupial stem cells -- and then turn those cells into a living animal. That is the technology we will develop as a part of this project.\"\n\nHybrid animals\n\nThe path forward, however, is not cut-and-dried. Tom Gilbert, a professor at the University of Copenhagen's GLOBE Institute, said there are significant limitations to de-extinction.\n\nRecreating the full genome of a lost animal from DNA contained in old thylacine skeletons is extremely challenging, and thus some genetic information will be missing, explained Gilbert, who is also director of the Danish National Research Foundation's Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics. He has studied resurrecting the extinct Christmas Island rat, also known as the Maclear's rat, but isn't involved in the thylacine project. The team won't be able to exactly recreate the thylacine but instead will end up creating a hybrid animal, an altered form of thylacine.\n\n\"We are unlikely to get the full genome sequence of the extinct species, thus we will never be able to fully recreate the genome of the lost form. There will always be some parts that can't be changed,\" Gilbert said via email.\n\n\"They will have to cherry pick what changes to make. And thus the result will be a hybrid.\"\n\nIt's possible, he said, that a genetically imperfect hybrid thylacine could have health problems and might not survive without a lot of help from humans. Other experts question the very concept of spending tens of millions of dollars on de-extinction attempts when so many living animals are on the brink of disappearing.\n\n\"To me the real benefit of any de-extinction project such as this is the awesomeness of it. Doing it seems very justified to me simply because it will excite people about science, nature, conservation,\" Gilbert said.\n\n\"And we sure as hell need that in the wonderful citizens of our world if we are to survive into the future. But ... do the stakeholders realize what they will get will not be the thylacine but some imperfect hybrid? What we don't need is yet more people disappointed (or) feeling cheated by science.\"", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}]}

The package is the product of painstaking negotiations, and its final passage would give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, must approve the bill before Biden can sign it into law.\n\nThe sweeping bill -- named the Inflation Reduction Act -- would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes -- including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks -- and boost the Internal Revenue Service's ability to collect.\n\nIt would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nSenate Democrats, with a narrow 50-seat majority, stayed unified to pass the legislation, using a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the measure without Republican votes.

And we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future.\"\n\nBiden praised the Senate for passing the bill in a statement Sunday, thanking Democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation's climate investments and health care provisions.\n\n\"Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,\" Biden said.\n\nHow Senate Democrats passed the bill on a party-line vote\n\nSenate Democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nManchin played a key role in shaping the legislation -- which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a major breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out.\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals, indicating she would \"move forward\" on the sweeping economic package.\n\nBut Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill.\n\nTo avoid a last-minute collapse of the bill on Sunday, Democrats created a plan to win over Sinema, who was concerned over the 15% corporate minimum tax's impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity. Senate Democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal, but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota suggested, they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years.\n\nThe change was intended to prevent House Democrats primarily from coastal districts, who have campaigned on repealing limits on the SALT deduction, from breaking from the bill, when they vote on it later this week.\n\nAfter the bill's passage in the Senate, Sinema said in a statement it would \"help Arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices, making health care more affordable and accessible, and securing Arizona's water and energy future,\" while also \"boosting innovation and spurring job creation.\"\n\nIn a good sign for the bill becoming law, key House Democrats signaled later Sunday that they'll vote for it despite previous demands over SALT.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey had been part of the \"No SALT, no deal\" caucus. But he said the bill passes his test because it doesn't raise individual income tax rates.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, another member of that caucus, echoed his sentiment: \"I will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing SALT. Because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.\"\n\nRepublicans used the weekend \"vote-a-rama\" to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate's reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included \"giant job-killing tax hikes\" and amounted to \"a war on American fossil fuel.\" The Kentucky Republican said Democrats \"do not care about middle-class families' priorities.\"\n\n\"And their response to the runaway inflation they've created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,\" said McConnell. \"The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.\"\n\nHow the bill addresses the climate crisis\n\nWhile economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions.\n\nThe nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet.\n\nAnalysis from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office -- as well as multiple independent analyses -- suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to President Joe Biden's goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.\n\nThe bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles.\n\nLawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what's needed to combat the climate crisis.\n\n\"This isn't about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. \"We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.\"\n\nKey health care and tax policy in the bill\n\nThe bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors' offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond.\n\nThis controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs.\n\nDemocrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn't expire just after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTo boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion.\n\nConcerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats' plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear.\n\nHowever, Sinema nixed her party's effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.\n\nThe provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers' profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats.\n\nIn its place, a 1% excise tax on companies' stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers", "Clare Foran", "Ali Zaslav", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/12/house-passes-inflation-reduction-act/10287418002/", "title": "House passes Inflation Reduction Act, a Biden win for health, climate", "text": "House passes bold climate and health care bill, capping a string of recent legislative wins for President Joe Biden.\n\nThe $739 billion Inflation Reduction Act will raise taxes on certain corporations and is projected to cut the deficit by about $100 billion over the next decade.\n\nWASHINGTON –The House on Friday passed the Inflation Reduction Act along party lines, rounding out a series of recent wins for President Joe Biden.\n\nThe House voted 220-207, with no Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the act.\n\nIt now heads to Biden, who is expected to sign it into law next week after months of negotiations between moderate and progressive Democrats, who ultimately reached an agreement late last month.\n\n\"We're unified!,\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told USA TODAY. \"(Democrats are) all in this together. We are all making life better for the American people.\"\n\nThe sweeping legislation on health care, climate and taxes passed through the Senate 51-50 along party lines last week after a 15-hour session of debate, amendments and negotiation ending in Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote.\n\n\"There are a few days in a congressional career that feel truly historic. To me, this is one of them,\" House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., said on the floor ahead of the vote.\n\n\"This legislation is historic, it's transformative and really a cause for celebration,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a news conference ahead of the vote.\n\nHouse Republicans criticized the Inflation Reduction Act as overreaching and said the billions of dollars in spending wouldn't solve inflation.\n\n\"Today the majority jams through another spending spree,\" House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy said in his nearly 50-minute speech on the floor ahead of the vote. \"I believe the largest tone-deaf bill we’ve seen in this chamber in 230 years.\n\n\"Passing this bill today means more expensive bills for Americans tomorrow.\"\n\nSome voters, and progressive lawmakers like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have said the Inflation Reduction Act doesn’t do enough to immediately alleviate strains on working families. He voted for the measure despite his tepid backing, saying the bill was a worthy down payment and signaling to other progressives they should support it as well.\n\nMore:Here's how the Inflation Reduction Act could save consumers money and protect the planet\n\nIt’s hard to show how the bill translates into immediate, meaningful change for Americans’ wallets, said Casey Burgat, legislative affairs program director at George Washington University.\n\nBut it is “a huge, landmark piece of legislation,” he said. “It’s a Democratic bill through and through. It’s not as big as they wanted it to be, but it’s what is passable in a 50-50 Senate headed into a midterm.”\n\nThis vote follows a productive summer for Democrats, who passed a gun control bill, the CHIPS Act to boost high-tech manufacturing and the PACT Act to aid veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, as well as approving Finland and Sweden’s entry to NATO.\n\nThat’s a remarkable lineup of legislation in a Senate Democratic majority that can’t afford to lose one vote and has to negotiate with a range of ideologies from Sanders to Sen. Joe Manchin, a coal-country moderate representing West Virginia, Burgat said.\n\n“It’s a surprising amount they’ve gotten done,” he said.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act – a pared-down version of Biden's original Build Back Better plan – will now go to the president's desk for a signature.\n\nBiden's original $1.7 trillion domestic package included an array of social investments like universal preschool, paid family leave and an expanded child tax credit. Those social programs were cut over a year of negotiations in the Senate, with moderate Democrats such as Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona taking aim at the bill's cost and impact on the growing national debt.\n\nEven as concessions in negotiations stripped the bill of many social investments and pared down climate investments by more than $100 billion, progressive Democrats still celebrated the Inflation Reduction Act as a legislative win and the largest investment in climate in the nation's history.\n\n\"There would be no Inflation Reduction Act without Build Back Better, and there would be no Build Back Better without the work of the progressive caucus,\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said in a progressive caucus news conference early Friday.\n\nThe 10-year, $739 billion package will raise taxes on certain corporations while reducing the deficit by about $100 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe bill would allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices – long opposed by the pharmaceutical industry – and extend Affordable Care Act subsidies three more years through 2025.\n\n\"We have been trying for decades to prevail, to win legislation that enabled the (Health and Human Services) secretary to negotiate lower drug prices,\" Pelosi said in a news conference. \"Big Pharma has had a stranglehold on Congress, and we couldn't get it done until now.\"\n\nIt also would reinstate a tax on the oil industry to help pay for the cleanup of hazardous Superfund sites. And it would add 87,000 IRS workers to help process a lengthy backlog of audits, which McCarthy called the \"most chilling\" part of the act.\n\nCandy Woodall is a Congress reporter for USA TODAY.

The legislation would decrease the federal deficit by $102 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill didn't pass unscathed: Republicans stripped a $35 monthly cap on insulin co-pays via amendment, arguing the provision violated procedural rules. Seven Republicans sided with Democrats to try to keep the measure in place: Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said Thursday she would vote for it after securing commitments on drought relief and tax changes.\n\nAmid 40-year-high inflation, Democrats framed and titled the legislation as a way to bring down consumer costs, but economists disagree on how effective it would be in that regard.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton budget model predicted the impact on inflation would be \"statistically indistinguishable from zero\" over the long term and slightly increase inflation before 2024.\n\nAn analysis from Moody's Analytics found the legislation would \"nudge the economy and inflation in the right direction, while meaningfully addressing climate change and reducing the government’s budget deficits.\"\n\nSchumer, in a news conference after the vote, called the bill “the most significant bill to fight the climate crisis ever.\"\n\nBut he also said throughout negotiations that he told his caucus they “were going to have to swallow some bad stuff to get the good stuff,” like permitting reform backed by Manchin that’s seen as beneficial to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAnd while the Inflation Reduction Act did not include many of Biden’s sweeping social programs proposed in his original Build Back Better plan, like the child tax credit and family leave, Schumer said that Senate Democrats “would return to those issues with a vengeance in the fall.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/08/senate-inflation-reduction-act-drug-pricing-energy-biden/10271357002/", "title": "Senate passes Inflation Reduction Act to address drug pricing, energy", "text": "Hello, OnPolitics readers!\n\nPresident Joe Biden saw firsthand Monday what he described as \"incredibly heartbreaking\" devastation unleashed by flash flooding that killed at least 37 people in southeastern Kentucky and left a path of destruction across several counties.\n\nKentucky Gov.

Should he be forgiven?\n\nBiden has used a wartime power throughout his presidency, but will he rely on it even more?\n\nOn his first full day in office, President Joe Biden took advantage of a special, wartime power to supercharge the U.S. pandemic response, using a tool he would return to multiple times throughout his presidency.\n\nIn an executive order citing authority under the Defense Production Act, the new president directed his administration to secure masks, tests and other equipment in short supply. Biden soon ordered a 100-day White House review of American industry that concluded the act was a “powerful tool” that could be deployed beyond the pandemic and traditional military use.\n\nWhat is the Defense Production Act? The Defense Production Act, enacted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, is an authority the president has to order private business to prioritize and produce goods needed for the national defense, emergency preparedness and to recover from natural disasters.\n\nBiden went on to issue a series of orders relying on the act – to jumpstart mining of minerals for electric car batteries in March and to increase baby formula supplies in May. In June, he invoked the act in orders authorizing federal investment in manufacturing of solar panel components, insulation, electrical transformers and heat pumps, part of a broader effort to combat climate change.\n\nBiden’s exercising of the unilateral power has also drawn criticism that he has twisted the act beyond its intent to advance his political agenda and, at times, to compensate for administration oversights.\n\nHistory shows Biden is far from the first commanders in chief to use the law.

Smith, Vineland Daily Journal\n\nGOP dominates Virginia races\n\nVirginia Republicans completed a sweep of down-ballot statewide offices Wednesday, with victories for attorney general and lieutenant governor, including the first Black woman ever to be elected statewide in the commonwealth.\n\nThe wins echoed the Democrats' defeat in the race for governor, and marked a dramatic turnaround in a state where the GOP had not won a statewide race since 2009.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Republican Winsome Sears, who returned to Virginia politics after an absence of nearly two decades, defeated Democrat Hala Ayala. Sears becomes the first woman to serve as lieutenant governor and the first woman of color to hold statewide office. Ayala would have broken the same historic barriers had she won.\n\nIn the attorney general's race, Republican Jason Miyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, defeated the Democratic incumbent, Mark Herring, who was running for a third term. The AG race was called late on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Ayala and Herring conceded.\n\nSears rocketed out of political obscurity earlier this year when she won the GOP nomination on the strength of a campaign photo in which she posed holding a military rifle. She will succeed Democrat Justin Fairfax, who unsuccessfully ran for governor.\n\nMiyares will be the first Republican to hold the attorney general post since Ken Cuccinelli won in 2009. A delegate from Virginia Beach, Miyares highlighted his background as the son of a Cuban immigrant throughout the campaign. He frequently criticized Herring for decisions by the state parole board to release inmates early without notifying victims, decisions Herring said were totally outside his jurisdiction.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nGov. Phil Murphy speaks at victory rally\n\nDemocratic Gov. Phil Murphy, fresh off the Associated Press call that he won re-election in New Jersey, spoke at a victory rally Wednesday night.\n\nIn a brief speech in Asbury Park, New Jersey, Murphy said he was \"humbled\" to win a second term and seemed to acknowledge how divided the electorate was in the results.\n\n\"If you want to be governor of all of New Jersey, you must listen to all of New Jersey. And New Jersey, I hear you,\" he said. \"So tonight I renew my promise to you — whether you voted for me or not — to work every single day of the next four years to keep moving us forward.\"\n\nHowever, the campaign of his Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, did not concede defeat.\n\n\"With the candidates separated by a fraction of a percent out of 2.4 million ballots cast, it’s irresponsible of the media to make this call when the New Jersey Secretary of State doesn’t even know how many ballots are left to be counted,\" spokeswoman Stami Williams said on Twitter.\n\n– Dustin Racioppi\n\n5 election takeaways:Education critical in Virginia; an historic night for candidates of color\n\nIn New Jersey, localized politics\n\nSimilar to Virginia, New Jersey’s matchup between Ciattarelli and Murphy often localized national politics.\n\nWhile Ciattarelli tried to steer attention to the parochial issues of property tax rates, school funding and quality of life, Murphy’s campaign relentlessly tied him to former president Donald Trump.\n\nAnticipating another four years under Murphy, advocates and the governor’s supporters have pushed an ambitious and wide-ranging agenda that includes putting an end to all fossil fuel projects, decriminalizing all drugs, reforming the tax code and studying reparations.\n\nDespite his strong outside support, Murphy would still have to bargain with Democratic lawmakers who have at times served as a check on his ambitions. Democrats retained their control of both chambers of the Legislature, though they appeared to be on pace to lose seats, including the powerful one held by Sweeney. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin was expected to keep his leadership positions.\n\nRepublicans haven’t controlled the Legislature for 20 years and now, with Ciattarelli’s narrow loss, the question turns to whether they can build on this year's momentum to take back political control in the legislative or executive branches.\n\nRead the whole story here:NJ Gov.

He noted that McAuliffe received the most votes ever for a Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia.\n\nHe said his social spending and infrastructure bills “should have passed” before election day but isn’t sure it would have “changed the number of very conservative folks” who turned out in red districts where Donald Trump is popular to vote for Republican Glenn Youngkin.\n\n\"But maybe, maybe,\" Biden added.\n\nBiden made multiple campaign stops in Virginia for McAuliffe and aggressively sought to tie Youngkin to the divisive politics of Trump.\n\n“People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things,” Biden said, “from COVID, to school, to jobs, to a whole range of things – and the cost of a gallon of gasoline. And so, if I'm able to pass and sign into law my ‘Build Back Better’ initiative, I'm in a position where you're going to see a lot of those things ameliorated quickly and swiftly. So that has to be done.”\n\nAsked what Democrats need to do to respond to Republican attacks over critical race theory and other cultural issues, Biden said, “We should produce for the American people.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nVirginia voters said about race, education and teachers\n\nConcerns about how race is taught in schools brought out voters across Virginia on Election Day, when it emerged as a key reason some residents cast a ballot in the commonwealth’s gubernatorial race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin.\n\nYoungkin, who defeated the former governor, leaned into parents' anger over education during the campaign, vowing to ban the teaching of critical race theory when he enters office. He and his supporters criticized McAuliffe for comments made during a debate on Sept. 29: “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,” McAuliffe said.\n\nCritical race theory is a legal framework that examines how systemic racism continues to permeate U.S. law and society. Virginia public schools do not teach it at K-12 levels. Nevertheless, the candidates and voters appeared focused on the issue this election.\n\n-- Katie Wadington\n\nRead the full story:Here's what Virginia voters said about race, education and teachers in the Youngkin-McAuliffe election\n\nMurphy, Ciattarelli trade leads\n\nAs of midafternoon Wednesday, the New Jersey governor's race remains on a razor's edge, with votes trickling in.\n\nUpdated vote totals have incumbent Phil Murphy ahead of Jack Ciattarelli by nearly 15,000 votes, according to the Associated Press, which put Murphy's vote total at 1,199,614 and Ciattarelli's total at 1,184,723.\n\nThe closeness of the race has surprised experts, who watched public polls showing Murphy leading comfortably and looked to his party's registration advantage of more than a million voters.\n\n“If you asked anybody several months ago within the state, I think anyone would have predicted a high double digit landslide for Murphy,” said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling.\n\nNew Jersey does not have an automatic recount law, but the candidates are permitted to request one.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., said if Democrats in Congress had passed legislation for President Joe Biden’s social welfare program and for infrastructure, the victories would have helped Terry McAuliffe in the race he lost Tuesday for governor of Virginia and helped congressional Democrats in 2022.\n\nProgressive House Democrats have blocked a vote on infrastructure legislation, which the Senate has already approved, until it can be considered with Biden’s broader package.\n\n“Instead, Democrats wanted to be purists about whatever their own particular goals were left, right and center and hold out and dither and delay,” Kaine said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has proposed voting on both bills as early as this week. Kaine said they might both be completed by Thanksgiving. But McAuliffe has already lost.\n\n“A lot of politics is about timing,” Kaine said. “Dems blew the timing.”\n\nKaine said McAuliffe could have campaigned on universal pre-kindergarten and child care in the larger package, and on the jobs that the infrastructure bill would have created.\n\n“He could have had a really great wind at his back if Democrats had been willing to get the deal done,” Kaine said. “So I'm just saying I hope my colleagues absorb this notion that when you’re in the majority, the D in Democrats should stand for doing and not delay, dithering, do nothing, division.”\n\nKaine noted that turnout was 25% higher than the previous governor’s race four years earlier. The state doesn’t require voters to register by party, so Kaine argued Democrats needed to win over independent voters.\n\n“Terry could have won a lot of them over if we had given him some things to sell, instead of the message primarily that, you know, Dems are in disarray,” Kaine said. “I hope the Dems view this as the Ghost of Christmas Future experience. Like this isn't what the future has to be. But if you don't change your ways, this is the future.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\n3 Democratic Senate races now considered toss-ups\n\nA political odds-maker at the University of Virginia changed its ratings Wednesday in four competitive Democratic U.S. Senate races, after Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor’s race.\n\nSabato’s Crystal Ball, which is named for Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said the election confirmed a poor environment for Democrats, which if replicated in 2022 could help Republicans could win control of the House and Senate.\n\nThe ratings changed in three races from “leans Democratic” to a toss-up, for Sens. Mark Kelly in Arizona, Raphael Warnock in Georgia and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. The rating for Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., changed from “safe Democratic” to “likely Democratic.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMcAuliffe concedes to Youngkin in Virginia governor's race\n\nVirginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe conceded his run for governor after a bruising campaign against Republican Glenn Youngkin. The race was widely watched as a bellwether for the national mood amid the coronavirus pandemic and first year of Democrats' unified control of Washington.\n\n“Congratulations to Governor-Elect Glenn Youngkin on his victory. I hope Virginians will join me in wishing the best to him and his family,” McAuliffe said in a Wednesday morning statement.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the campaign “came up short” in the race, McAuliffe reiterated the need to make progress on progressive priorities like health care, voting rights and family policy.\n\nMcAuliffe served as Virginia’s governor after a 2013 victory that presaged Democrats’ later victories in the state legislature in 2018.

The races were too early to call.\n\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, voters chose between two women for a post that has been held by men for as long as the state has existed. Democrat Hala Ayala, a delegate from Woodbridge, faced Republican Winsome Sears, who served in the legislature for a single term two decades ago and was attempting a political comeback. Either also would be the first woman of color to be elected to statewide office in Virginia.\n\nThe winner will succeed Democrat Justin Fairfax, who unsuccessfully ran for governor. The marquee election Tuesday was the gubernatorial race, which Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin won, defeating former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\n\nWhile the AP did not call the down-ballot races, Republicans were claiming victories in both. Sears stood with her family in front of cheering supporters at a victory party in Chantilly, saying, \"What you are looking at is the American Dream.\"\n\nAyala did not concede defeat early Wednesday morning.\n\nFor attorney general, Democrat Mark Herring was seeking a third term against Republican Jason Miyares, a delegate from Virginia Beach. Herring would be the first attorney general to win a third term since World War II.\n\nMiyares, the son of a Cuban immigrant, also declared victory early Wednesday, saying he is now the first Latino to be elected statewide in Virginia. \"I can't wait to go to work with Governor Youngkin and Lieutenant Governor Sears for you,\" he said.\n\nHerring had not conceded defeat early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBuffalo mayor's write-in campaign looks successful\n\nBuffalo Mayor Byron Brown appeared to win a fifth term Tuesday after lodging a robust write-in effort against India Walton, a trained nurse and activist whose socialist beliefs became a central issue in the race.\n\nBrown, a Democrat who first took office in 2006, resorted to a write-in campaign after losing a June primary to Walton, a Democrat making her first run for office.\n\nThe effort, initially thought to be a longshot, appeared to be successful, though it won't be official until the write-in votes are verified and mail-in ballots are counted.\n\nWrite-in candidates received 33,994 votes — about 59% of the total — with 98% of election districts reporting late Tuesday, according to the Erie County Board of Elections.\n\n– Jon Campbell, New York State Team\n\nYoungkin flips Virginia\n\nAn excited Glenn Youngkin claimed the governor's office in Virginia by telling supporters he would pursue a transformation of the state's economy and school system.\n\n\"We can build a new day,\" Youngkin told screaming supporters at a hotel in northern Virginia early Wednesday.\n\nYoungkin, a decided underdog at the start of the campaign, overtook Democrat Terry McAuliffe by stressing education – especially the teaching of race and history – and the economy.\n\n\"Together, we will change the trajectory of this Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in his victory speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMore:Red alert: Crushing defeat in Virginia could signal more bad news for Democrats ahead\n\nAdams wins in NYC, Bragg takes Manhattan DA's race\n\nRetired police officer Eric Adams defeated underdog Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa on Tuesday to become the second Black mayor in the history of New York City.

Supporters said a complete overhaul of policing was necessary to stop police violence. Opponents said the proposal had no concrete plan for how to move forward and warned it would leave some communities already affected by violence more vulnerable as crime is on the rise.\n\nThose opponents welcomed the amendment's defeat but stressed the urgency of transforming policing in the city even without it.\n\n“Tonight Minneapolis voters have made clear that we want a planful approach to transforming policing and public safety in our city that needs to include meaningful consultation with the communities that are most impacted by both violent crime and by over-policing,” said Leili Fatehi, manager of the All of Mpls campaign.\n\nThe ballot proposal had roots in the abolish-the-police movement that erupted after Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last year.\n\n– Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/03/deity-purgatory-virgin-snake-birth-slug-dough-traps-news-around-states/118529798/", "title": "'Deity' in Purgatory, virgin snake birth: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Jordan-Hare Stadium will officially be at full capacity for Auburn football games in 2021, the university said in a release outlining what game days will look like this year.

A ban on plastic bags is back in force in Alaska’s largest city after a temporary suspension during the pandemic, Alaska’s News Source reports. As of Wednesday, the option when checking out is paper or reusable options. The ban first took effect in 2019, but Assembly member Felix Rivera said it was relaxed during the pandemic in part because the supply chain for paper bags was disrupted. There were also concerns about whether reusable bags could transmit the coronavirus, he said. “I think since last year, we’ve learned a lot about the virus, and now nothing that I am reading leads me to have a lot of concern about reusable bags transmitting the virus,” he told the Anchorage television station.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a process that some people call a “virgin birth,” a Brazilian rainbow boa was born at the Phoenix Zoo with DNA from only one parent. Its mom, who has been at the zoo for 10 years, has never been paired for mating. Imagine the keepers’ surprise when the baby boa was discovered in the snake’s enclosure Aug. 3. The snake was likely born through parthenogenesis, in which one – or multiple – eggs mature without fertilization. The zoo believes this is the second documented birth of its kind among Brazilian rainbow boas. Mom is currently in the Boa Hut on the Forest of Uco Trail, and the zoo plans to house the baby in a reptile nursery on the Children’s Trail. So-called virgin births, or asexual reproduction, may not be that uncommon among vertebrates. Thelma, a reticulated python at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, gave birth to six baby pythons without a partner in 2014. “Once considered an evolutionary novelty, facultative parthenogenesis has now been documented in an increasing number of vertebrate species, ranging from the hammerhead shark to domestic turkeys, komodo dragons to snakes,” Warren Booth, an associate professor of molecular ecology at the University of Tulsa who studies the phenomenon, said in a statement in 2016.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several inmates say they weren’t told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used for that purpose. Three inmates at the Washington County jail said they didn’t know they were being given ivermectin until its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said it’s heard similar complaints from inmates. The inmates’ comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail’s physician that use of the drug was voluntary. “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for the virus. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients. Edrick Floreal-Wooten said he was given ivermectin after testing positive Aug. 21. “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” Floreal-Wooten said. He said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates. “Never. I’m not livestock,” he said. “I’m a human.” The ACLU said it has also heard from inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon force large department stores to display some child products in gender-neutral ways after the Legislature passed a bill Wednesday aimed at getting rid of traditional pink and blue marketing schemes for items like toys and toothbrushes. The bill would not outlaw boys and girls sections in department stores but would require retailers to have a gender-neutral section to display “a reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” It would only apply to department stores with 500 or more employees, so most small businesses would be exempt. It also wouldn’t apply to clothes, just toys and “childcare items,” which include hygiene and teething products. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly for a procedural vote before it heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. If it becomes law, California would become the first state to require these sections in stores, according to the office of Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, the bill’s author. He said the measure was inspired by a 10-year-old whose mother works in his legislative office. “Britten asked her mom while shopping why certain things in a store were ‘off limits’ to her because she was a girl but would be fine if she was a boy,” Low said. “Thankfully, my colleagues recognized the pure intentions of this bill and the need to let kids be kids.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three suburban police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter that provoked national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. The grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Phil Weiser are the latest chapter for the police department in the city of Aurora, which has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. McClain’s death helped inspire a sweeping police accountability law in Colorado, a ban on chokeholds and restrictions on the use of the sedative ketamine, both of which the indictment alleges contributed to his death. The charges were announced days after the second anniversary of when police stopped McClain on the street after a 911 caller reported a man who seemed “sketchy.” “What I set out to do is still not over, but I’m halfway there. I’m halfway there,” McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, said of her efforts to hold police accountable. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over last year and has pledged to work to restore public trust, said the department will continue to cooperate with the judicial process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: A small jet crashed shortly after taking off from a small airport Thursday morning, killing all four people aboard, officials said. The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the building has been accounted for, and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said. Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida overnight, officials said the city was seeing historic flooding Thursday. The Wilmington Fire Department and other agencies were performing water rescues, and many streets and bridges remained closed, officials said. Flooding affected several neighborhoods, and a Wilmington Fire Department spokesperson said crews had rescued 60 to 80 people by noon. Delaware Department of Transportation Community Relations Director CR McLeod said the flooding was affecting homes and businesses, and there were many vehicles underwater, WDEL-FM reports. More than 50 bridges would need to be surveyed and assessed, he said. “A lot of this water is coming down from Pennsylvania with the excessive amounts of rain that they had associated with the storm yesterday,” McLeod said. “All that water is going to make its way down toward the Delaware River, and it’s all coming down the Brandywine.” The Brandywine entered a major flood stage Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it reached a maximum crest of 23.1 feet, a new record, according to the National Weather Service. Waters began to recede, and the creek was expected to fall below flood stage early Friday, according to the agency.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital ranks last in the country for teacher pay compared to other jobs, WUSA-TV reports, citing a study from business.org. The July study compared the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers to the average salary for all jobs within each state and the district. The data was collected using the National Center for Education Statistics and compared with the salaries of all occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results found that D.C. and Virginia rank last in the country, with educators earning 17% and 10% less than the average wage, respectively. Virginia and D.C. are among seven states that the study claims pay teachers below the state’s average salary. The study reports that Mississippi has the lowest salary for teachers at just more than $45,000 per year, but that is still 8.6% higher than the average salary in the state. Pennsylvania ranked highest in the country, according to the study, with teachers earning 30% more than the average wage.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An elementary school was placed in a temporary, limited lockdown after a parent threatened to leave his job and confront an assistant principal for telling his children they couldn’t come to school without being masked. Christopher Kivlin was met by police officers Tuesday outside Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota. No charges were filed, but he was ordered not to come back to the school without calling first and getting permission. An incident report said Kivlin showed up to campus saying the school was violating the law by not allowing his children to attend school. The Sarasota County school district is among a dozen of Florida’s 67 districts, representing about half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students, that have defied Gov. Rob DeSantis’ executive order barring schools from requiring masks over parent objections. A judge last week ruled that DeSantis did not have the authority to issue the order. The DeSantis administration is expected to appeal the decision. Kivlin told television station WFLA he had no intention of hurting anyone but just wanted to talk to a school official. He apologized for scaring anyone and said that “it was just emotions built up.” “I found out after the fact that the school had to go into lockdown, I was like, ‘That’s horrible,’ ” Kivlin said. “I feel like I might have scared other parents.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge’s decision striking down a Trump-era rule that eliminated federal protections for some wetlands and streams is giving hope to opponents of a proposed mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge in southeast Georgia. A federal judge in Arizona on Monday tossed the rule that narrowed the types of U.S. waters that qualify for federal protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. The judge’s order, which applies nationwide, says the rule enacted under former President Donald Trump improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. One high-profile project directly affected by the environmental rollbacks under Trump was a proposal by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals to mine titanium dioxide on land about 3 miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge near the Georgia-Florida line. Conservationists fear mining close to the swamp’s edge could cause irreparable harm to the largest federal wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. Yet the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the project no longer required a federal permit because the rollbacks under Trump excluded wetlands on the site from federal protection. That left sole authority to Georgia state regulators to decide whether it could move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tourism officials have released a plan to reduce visitors on Oahu, the state’s most frequently visited and populous island. The plan was approved by the Hawaii Tourism Authority in July, and the full plan has now been released to the public, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Decreasing the total number of visitors to Oahu to a manageable level by controlling the number of visitor accommodations and exploring changes to land use, zoning and airport policies,” the plan says. It also establishes a regenerative tourism fee, creates reservation systems for natural and cultural sites, manages visitors’ use of cars, and promotes consumption of locally produced and sold goods. “We appreciate the Oahu residents who participated in the (plan) process and passionately contributed their diverse viewpoints, discussed various tourism-related challenges in their neighborhoods and helped set forth an actionable plan that is necessary for the community’s well-being,” said John De Fries, the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s president and CEO. “It’s about continued collaboration and moving forward together to malama (care for) this cherished place and each other, as desired by the people of Oahu.” The three-year plan was developed by community members and county officials in collaboration with the tourism authority.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: At least two state lawmakers received threatening letters concerning their votes on a law intended to drastically reduce wolf numbers. The anonymous letters to Republican Sen. Dan Johnson and Republican Rep. Caroline Troy say that “just as the wolf went from predator to prey, so shall you.” It’s not clear how many more lawmakers received the letters. The Lewiston Tribune reports some of the lawmakers contacted the Idaho State Police. Backers of the wolf law that took effect July 1 said the state can cut the number of wolves to 150 before federal authorities would take over management. That would be a 90% reduction of the state’s 1,500 wolves. The letters describe lawmakers as “nothing more than a sellout to the Cattle Association and that pitiful minority of cattle producers that seemingly dictate how our wildlife lives and dies.” Johnson said the envelope had a Sacramento postmark, and the return address was the Statehouse in Boise. “It’s OK for people to disagree with my votes or my bills, but some comments cross the line,” he said. “I think this letter comes close to the line, if not stepping over it.” The law passed the Senate 26-7 with no support from Democrats. It passed the House 58-11 with one Democrat in support and no Republicans opposed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Rowers, kayakers and other users of the Chicago River are getting a real-time look at one measure of water quality in the system that weaves through downtown and several neighborhoods. Chicago nonprofit Current installed three sensors in the river’s three main branches in 2019 to continuously estimate the amount of bacteria from human and other warm-blooded animals’ waste. The organization initially planned to begin making the real-time results public in 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic delayed its plans until Thursday, when a website updating with data taken every 15 minutes went online. The city’s development in the 19th century was thanks to the river – truly a system of rivers and manmade canals – that provided a path between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system. While the meatpacking and lumber industries could use it for shipping, the waterway also became a dumping ground for those and other industries and for sewage from homes and businesses. Quality of the 156-mile river system has improved in recent years, helped by multibillion-dollar construction of new reservoirs and underground tunnels. But when rain overwhelms Chicago’s sewer systems, sewage and stormwater is diverted to the river, prompting warnings to stay off the water for several days.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Schools got an incentive from the governor Wednesday to require face masks in classrooms in hopes of slowing down the number of COVID-19 outbreaks among students. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a new statewide executive order that eases quarantine requirements for students if all children and adults in the school were wearing masks throughout the day. The revised order comes as many Indiana schools have seen COVID-19 outbreaks and as the state’s vaccination rate remains stubbornly low. Holcomb said the coronavirus’ spread in Indiana was regrettable but avoidable. “To the skeptics or unbelievers or deniers, I would just plead to look at the facts, to look at the numerical data that shows we can all stay safe if you get vaccinated,” Holcomb said. Meanwhile, the state’s largest hospital system will be stopping all inpatient nonemergency surgeries as the state faces a growing surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Indiana University Health announced Thursday that the surgery suspension would start Monday. The decision comes after IU Health said last week that it was cutting such surgeries by half. IU Health, which operates 16 hospitals around the state, also said that more than 1,000 employees did not meet Wednesday’s deadline to get COVID-19 vaccinations and would be suspended immediately.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A federal judge on Thursday ordered a prominent participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to return to jail after he was caught accessing the internet to watch false conspiracy theories about the presidential election. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said Doug Jensen, 42, of Des Moines, had violated the strict conditions that were set when he was released from jail July 13, including prohibitions on accessing the internet and using a cellphone. Prosecutors had moved to revoke Jensen’s pretrial release Aug. 19, days after a federal officer found Jensen in his garage using an iPhone to watch news from Rumble, a streaming platform popular with conservatives. Jensen acknowledged that he had earlier watched two days of the cyber symposium sponsored by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who used the event to push false theories that the 2020 election’s outcome was changed by Chinese hackers. Kelly noted that he had released Jensen from jail in July after Jensen claimed he had an awakening behind bars and realized the QAnon conspiracy theory to which he adhered was a “pack of lies.” The judge said it was significant that Jensen’s violations were caught during the first unannounced visit to his home by pretrial services officers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About a third of Kansas nursing homes have less than half of their health care workers vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data released by the state. Just four of the more than 300 federally licensed nursing homes are meeting the state’s goal for 90% of health care workers vaccinated, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows. The departments released the data about a week after President Joe Biden announced that his administration will require nursing home staff to be vaccinated as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. The department for aging and disability services said in a statement last week that it released the data to prepare for those new rules. Gov. Laura Kelly’s office said in a statement, without offering details, that the administration would encourage nursing home workers to get inoculated. As of Wednesday, about 46% of Kansans were fully vaccinated, according to data provided by the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A judge has refused to grant a divorce decree to a couple who swore under oath that their marriage was irreparably broken. The reason, she said: They were too nice to each other in court. In a decision condemned by divorce lawyers, Bullitt Family Court Judge Monica Meredith at least temporarily declined to dissolve Douglas and Nicole Potts’ 13-year marriage, which both insist can’t be salvaged. In an Aug. 23 order continuing the case and suggesting the couple undergo counseling, Meredith observed they were “respectful and courteous toward one another, and both held themselves in dignified and mature composure.” Meredith, who was elected to Family Court in 2018, said that “divorce court does not typically bring that demeanor out in its participants.” But in interviews and emails, a half-dozen family lawyers said Meredith’s order was inappropriate, unlawful and ridiculous. “It sends a terrible message to litigants: You are better served by acting like a petulant child in court than by acting mature,” said Louisville attorney Hal Helmers, who wasn’t involved in the case. Louise Graham, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, said counseling may be ordered only if one side disagrees the marriage is over. “Ninety-nine percent of divorce lawyers agree with the above, and we can never agree on ANYTHING,” Helmers said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: Photos show what appears to be a miles-long oil slick near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida, according to aerial survey imagery released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reviewed by the Associated Press. The government imagery, along with additional photos taken by the AP from a helicopter Tuesday, also show Louisiana port facilities, oil refineries and shipyards in the storm’s path where the telltale rainbow sheen typical of oil and fuel spills is visible in the water of bays and bayous. Both state and federal regulators said Wednesday that they had been unable to reach the stricken area, citing challenging conditions in the disaster zone. The NOAA photos show a black slick floating in the Gulf near a large rig with the name Enterprise Offshore Drilling painted on its helipad. Aerial photos taken by NOAA on Tuesday also show significant flooding to the massive Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery along the bank of the Mississippi River, just south of New Orleans. In some sections of the refinery, rainbow sheen is visible on the water leading toward the river. Asked about reports of levee failures near the refinery Monday, Phillips 66 spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there was “some water” in the facility and stressed that operations were shut down before the storm.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Newly unionized nurses at Maine Medical Center are frustrated over the end of pandemic accommodations. The policies had let high-risk employees work outside COVID-19 care, covered COVID-19 treatment costs, provided quarantine pay for coronavirus exposure outside the workplace and allowed pregnant nurses to start paid maternity leave in the last month of their pregnancy. “In the middle of a spike in infections from a fast-moving variant, this is not the time to remove the protections that have helped both staff and patients here for the past several months,” nurse Madison Light said. The surge is causing nurses to scramble to staff the COVID-19 units. They’re not getting enough breaks, they said. “Now it feels like there is no end in sight. Nurses and caregivers are exhausted, frustrated, and stretched to their physical and emotional limits,” Light said. MaineHealth said its policies on COVID-19 exposure and pregnancy leave follow current clinical and OSHA guidelines. Accommodations for high-risk employees are considered on a case-by-case basis, the company said.\n\nMaryland\n\nThurmont: First responders in western Maryland used a boat to rescue 10 children and a driver from a school bus caught in rising floodwaters as the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon. Frederick County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Todd Wivell said the bus got stuck when it tried to cross a bridge in the Thurmont area that had water going across it, WTOP-FM reports. The driver and 10 children were rescued from the bus by boat, with the help of first responders from the sheriff’s office and the Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, he said. Even 6 inches of moving water is enough to knock a person off their feet, Wivell said. Frederick County Public Schools recalled all school buses that were in the process of dropping students off. Parents were asked to pick their kids up from school buildings. Frederick County Public Schools’ Superintendent Terry Alban apologized after facing criticism for not dismissing children early, saying the decision to remain open for a full day led to “stress and anxiety for many,” The Frederick News-Post reports. School systems in neighboring counties sent students home early ahead of forecasted inclement weather.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A question that would require voters to present an ID and a second that would grant new benefits for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft while stopping short of declaring them employees have cleared an initial hurdle on their way to next year’s ballot. Other proposed initiatives that received a constitutional green light from Attorney General Maura Healey’s office Wednesday would legalize the sale of fireworks, create a “whale safe fishing act,” allow for the return of “happy hours,” and create a “Right to Counsel Program” for those facing eviction. The questions were among 16 proposed laws and one proposed constitutional amendment that met the requirements for ballot initiatives outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution, according to Healey’s office. Another 13 proposals were deemed unconstitutional. The state constitution requires proposed initiatives be in the proper form to present to voters, not be substantially the same as any measure on the ballot in either of the two preceding statewide elections, contain only subjects related to each other and not involve topics specifically excluded from the ballot initiative process.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Thousands of Flint residents were put at potential risk because a New York law firm, for six months, used handheld X-ray devices to scan their bones for lead without first registering the devices and putting recommended safety measures in place, documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press show. Starting in about August 2020, the Napoli Shkolnik firm used the portable scanners – which are tools in the mining and scrap metal industries but are not designed for use on humans – as a way of bolstering residents’ claims for larger shares of a proposed $641.25 million settlement of civil lawsuits arising from the 2014 lead poisoning of Flint’s drinking water supply. The law firm’s failure until February 2021 to register the devices with the state of Michigan, as required by law, and the state’s low-key response once it learned the scanners had been used for months without required approvals add insult to the injury that was the Flint drinking water crisis. “Unfortunately, thousands of bone scans using these devices ... went forward under improper and illegal circumstances,” said Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician and former president and CEO of Mott’s Children’s Health Center, who first raised concerns about the scanners in a February court filing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys for three former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death asked a judge Thursday to bar their upcoming trial from being livestreamed, saying some witnesses won’t testify if the proceedings are broadcast. The request from attorneys for Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao is an about-face from their earlier request to have the trial publicly broadcast, and it is opposed by prosecutors and news outlets. Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to stand trial next March on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 2020 death. Their co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter after weeks of proceedings that marked the first time in Minnesota that a criminal trial was livestreamed in its entirety. Before Chauvin’s trial, attorneys for all four men requested the trials be broadcast, but Lane and Kueng recently backtracked, with their attorneys saying that the “worldwide publicity” from televised coverage of Chauvin’s trail “crushed” their clients’ right to a fair trial. Attorneys Earl Gray and Tom Plunkett say the public access led some witnesses to decline testifying for the defense, noting one witness in the Chauvin trial has been harassed and another faced professional scrutiny.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The U.S. Marshals Service has arrested a man in connection with an assault on an MSNBC reporter during a live broadcast from the state Monday. Benjamin Dagley was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a shopping center in Dayton, Ohio, according to a report. With the assistance of the public, the Gulfport Police Department identified Dagley, of Wooster, Ohio, as a suspect in an assault on Shaquille Brewster as he covered Hurricane Ida. Dagley allegedly pulled up in white pickup truck and ran toward the camera crew. The suspect could be heard off-camera repeatedly screaming something about reporting the hurricane accurately. Brewster attempted to go on with the live coverage, even shifting his position to move away from the suspect, but when he realized the accused was not backing down, Brewster tossed it back to the studio. As the camera faded, viewers could see Brewster being physically confronted. Gulfport police issued warrants Tuesday charging Dagley with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbance of the peace and one count of violating emergency curfew. Police also said Dagley is on probation for a previous charge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state senator from Kansas City said he is demanding answers after an exhibit on the gay rights movement in Missouri was removed from the state Capitol. Democrat Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay member of the Missouri Senate, said he was “appalled” when he was told the exhibit, “Making History: Kansas City and the Rise of Gay Rights,” had been removed from the Missouri State Museum. Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources, did not immediately reply to questions about why the exhibit was moved and who made the decision. On Tuesday, Uriah Stark, legislative aide for state Rep. Mitch Boggs, R-La Russell, posted pictures of the exhibit on Facebook and questioned why the “taxpayer funded museum is pushing the LGBT agenda in our state capitol?” The next day, Stark thanked “several of our great elected officials” for having the exhibit removed, specifically mentioning Republican Reps. Ann Kelley, of Lamar, and Brian Seitz, of Branson, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “There is NOTHING controversial about an exhibit that explains how members of the LGBT community fought to end persecution and demand rights as citizens,” Razer tweeted Thursday. “I’m extremely disappointed and angry that @mostateparks may think otherwise.”\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park is ending its reservation requirement to travel on the Going-to-the-Sun Road after Labor Day as the busy summer season winds down. The reservation system has been in place for anyone wanting to travel on the scenic highway since May 28. Reservations were required between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. The pilot program testing the reservation system worked to alleviate traffic, but park officials said some people struggled to find available tickets. The park’s shuttle service will also end after Labor Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government is stepping in to help shuffle patients between local hospitals that are dealing with a surge of people with COVID-19 and other health issues, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. The Republican governor said the state has partnered with Nomi Health, the creators of the TestNebraska program, to offer call centers that overcrowded hospitals can contact when they need to transfer patients elsewhere. The around-the-clock call centers will serve as coordinators for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed, at a cost of $200,000 a month. The announcement is another sign that the state is once again struggling with coronavirus cases, even though most of the hospitalizations are patients without the coronavirus. State officials opened a similar call center last year but ended the program after the number of cases and hospitalizations declined. The new call center is scheduled to open Saturday. Nebraska’s hospitals reported to the state Wednesday that 72% of their 3,234 beds were occupied, although some facilities were far more crowded and having to send patients to other places. Ricketts relaxed licensing restrictions for nurses last week in an attempt to fix severe staffing shortages.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. said Wednesday that a conference scheduled next month in Las Vegas by a group espousing the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon won’t be held at any Caesars property. It wasn’t immediately clear if the “Patriot Double Down” event organized by Patriot Voice would be moved, postponed or canceled. Caesars Entertainment executive Kate Whiteley confirmed a Las Vegas Review-Journal report that the Oct. 23-25 event billed as a “Great Awakening Weekend” won’t be held at the new Caesars Forum convention space near the Las Vegas Strip. With tickets from $650 to $3,000, the conference was billed to feature speakers including former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and 8kun website owner Jim Watkins. QAnon is a theory featuring the baseless belief that satanic pedophiles, child sex traffickers and cannibals are in collusion with the so-called deep state and will be uncovered at a reckoning followers call a “Great Awakening.” QAnon signs are often seen at rallies for ex-President Donald Trump, and some adherents are facing trial for roles in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The group also derides the COVID-19 pandemic as a “plandemic,” suggesting the coronavirus was manufactured and its severity exaggerated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it’s experiencing staff shortages during the coronavirus pandemic that range from nursing positions to food service workers. The health care system said Wednesday that it organized a “Managing and Staffing to Capacity” task force to identify solutions to the shortage, especially in the inpatient units and other care areas at its flagship hospital in Lebanon. Dartmouth-Hitchcock also began planning for reallocation of resources and staff. Earlier this year, it increased the starting rate for newly licensed nurses to $30 per hour and made wage adjustments for experienced clinical nurses and nurse supervisors. It plans to provide a 2% wage increase for other staff beginning in October. Joni Menard, task force leader, said that “the overall situation continues to be challenging as clinical demand increases and the supply of traveling staff is depleted across the nation.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Murphy administration officials used an unapproved encryption app at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and deleted correspondence “on at least one occasion,” according to new court records. The alleged use of the encrypted messaging application Telegram by Department of Health officials shows the limits of New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act and the ability to skirt them and other laws and rules, experts said. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy revealed that health officials were communicating on Telegram in the administration’s latest legal filing in the whistleblower lawsuit brought by Christopher Neuwirth, an assistant health commissioner who was fired shortly after first-wave peak of the coronavirus. In a 308-page response countering Neuwirth’s claim that he was improperly fired last May, Murphy’s lawyers said Neuwirth required employees who reported to him “use a non-state-approved messaging application – Telegram – furthering burdening those state employees.” The Open Public Records Act does not specifically address encrypted messages but does include emails and text messages used for official business in its definition of government records. Such records are subject to public access unless they fall under one of more than two dozen exemptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta officials say they’re canceling some parts of the event and will require guests to wear masks to enter the grounds and while in indoor areas and crowded outdoor settings to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Wednesday he didn’t believe that face mask requirements and other safety practices would affect attendance numbers for the Oct. 2-10 event. “Masks have been a way of life that we’ve all been experiencing for the past year or more, so I think it’s one of those things that people are used to,” he said. The music fiesta is being canceled this year due to close proximity of guests, and the discovery center is being shelved because of its indoor nature featuring activities with multiple touchpoints, officials said. Other steps being taken include providing cashless options to buy tickets, moving hospitality seating outdoors and increasing spacing between popular special-shape balloons inside the park, officials said. The changes track federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and the current public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Democratic-led Legislature voted Wednesday to extend an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for commercial and residential tenants who fell behind on their rent because of hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had called the Legislature to return for an “extraordinary session” to pass the legislation, which will put evictions on hold until Jan. 15. New York’s previous eviction moratorium, which included foreclosure protections for property owners, expired Tuesday. In an Aug. 12 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court nixed part of the moratorium that allowed tenants to pause eviction proceedings simply by filing a form declaring they’d had a COVID-19-related financial hardship or that moving in a pandemic would prove a health risk. The court said landlords should have the ability to challenge those hardships in court. New York is poised to change how the moratorium works in light of that ruling. Landlords will be able to challenge hardship declarations and direct judges to require tenants with hardships to apply for rental assistance. Hochul said the legislation will stand up to legal scrutiny. But the leader of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest organization of landlords in New York, vowed Wednesday to sue to block the moratorium in federal court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The majority of public school students taking standardized state exams in reading, math and science last school year failed them, data shows. State education leaders cautioned against making year-over-year comparisons with the tests taken during a school year marked by limited in-person instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 45.4% of K-12 students passed the exams for the 2020-21 school year, according to results released at a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday. Two years ago – the last time testing was required – nearly 59% of K-12 students passed state exams. The U.S. Education Department did not require states to test students in the 2019-20 school year but required it this past year to assess pandemic learning loss. Because of coronavirus safety concerns, some high school students this past year took exams months after completing the course on which they were being tested. Some tests were revised, and a lower-than-normal share of students took them, news outlets report. “While the 2018-19 data is included as a way to provide context, comparison of the two years should only be made with a recognition that multiple anomalies occurred during the 2020-21 school year and during test administration,” state board member Jill Camnitz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A lawmaker who heads the state’s anti-abortion legislative caucus said Thursday that it’s likely the Republican-led Legislature will seek to pass a measure mirroring a new Texas law that virtually bans all abortions and that the Supreme Court has allowed to remain in force. GOP Sen. Janne Myrdal, one of the Legislature’s most ardent anti-abortion lawmakers, said she “assumes” legislation will be crafted eventually that uses the Texas law as a template. “I hear people talking about it,” Myrdal said. About a third of the Legislature’s 141 members are active in the caucus, which already has successfully pushed some of the nation’s toughest abortion laws. If it is drafted, it’s unclear when it would be introduced, though it could happen when the Legislature meets later this year in a reconvened or special session meant to deal with legislative redistricting. North Dakota is one of several states that have so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Myrdal said the high court’s action – or lack thereof – offers “a glimmer of hope” the court might eventually overturn Roe v. Wade because of its shift to the right following the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief this week launched an effort to purge inactive voters from state rolls, while using the announcement to push for passage of a bill making several changes to Ohio’s election process. The four-year process for purging inactive voters targets those who have not voted for two years and whose addresses may have changed and whose voter registration must be updated to reflect the move, according to Wednesday’s directive by GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose to Ohio’s 88 county elections boards. Inactive voters can keep themselves on the rolls by voting in any election in the next four years, submitting an absentee ballot application, registering to vote or taking other election-related steps. Earlier this year, LaRose said 97,795 inactive voter files were removed in scheduled post-2020 election voter roll maintenance, a lower number than predicted after thousands of voters avoided the purge by voting and undertaking other election activities. In his announcement Wednesday, LaRose also urged for the passage of a Republican voting bill introduced this spring that prohibits the placement of ballot drop boxes anywhere but at local elections offices, eliminates a day of early voting, shortens the window for requesting mail-in ballots and tightens voter ID requirements.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge on Wednesday said she will temporarily block a state law banning public school mask mandates, but students or their parents can opt out of the requirement if they choose. Judge Natalie Mai said she will issue a temporary injunction that will go into effect next week when she issues a written order detailing her ruling. Mai said she is blocking the law because it applies only to public, not private, schools, and schools adopting a mask mandate must provide an option for parents or students to opt out of the requirement. The ruling drew praise from Gov. Kevin Stitt, who signed the law and opposes mask mandates without exemptions, and Dr. Mary Clarke, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, which joined the lawsuit brought by four parents who oppose the law. “This is a victory for parental choice, personal responsibility and the rule of law,” Stitt said in a statement. Clarke said she was also pleased with the ruling. “This is just a first step in ensuring our schools maintain local control and can choose the best path for their students, faculty and staff,” Clarke said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Slugs and snails love bread dough, finds recent research from the Oregon State University Extension Service and other universities, suggesting a cheap, easy-to-make, nontoxic and widely available solution for gardeners and farmers alike. The state’s grass seed industry loses roughly $100 million a year to the slimy pests, according to the Oregon Seed Council. “Slugs and snails have a big impact on seed crops,” said Roger Beyer, the council’s executive director. “Our guys will work with anything, be it biological, pesticides or chemicals – whatever it takes to protect their crops, but it has to be economical.” The Oregon Seed Council provides $60,000 to $70,000 a year to fund slug and snail research at OSU, including for the work of gastropod specialist Rory McDonnell, who participated in the multi-university study that discovered bread dough attracts the pests. McDonnell and his fellow researchers ran simple experiments comparing how slugs and snails are attracted to different foods, essentially pitting foods in head-to-head contests until one was determined the most attractive. Cucumber was an early front-runner, and beer and strawberries did well, but bread dough was what really called the mollusks to dinner. McDonnell said it might be deployed in the creation of molluscicides, but dough should work for now.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change passed its last regulatory hurdle Wednesday, in a hard-fought bid to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. The plan to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants won a 3-2 party-line vote from the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, a five-member panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees. The commission voted after almost six hours of testimony and nearly two years of Wolf’s administration working on the regulation and shepherding it through the long regulatory process. The vote allows Pennsylvania, through regulation, to join a multistate consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By joining the consortium, “Pennsylvania is taking a historic, proactive and progressive approach that will have significant positive environmental, public health and economic impacts,” Wolf said in a statement after the vote. Mark Szybist, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it the “most important climate action that Pennsylvania has taken in more than a decade.” At 34%, Pennsylvania’s energy sector is its largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: Some residents will be paying more for their health insurance next year, but not as much as insurers wanted them to pay, the state Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner said Thursday. The rate increases for 2022 approved by Commissioner Patrick Tigue were lower than insurers has requested. “As Rhode Islanders confront significant threats to their health and financial well-being due to the spread of COVID-19, my responsibility is to limit the burden of the cost of health insurance within the standards for review and approval set forth by law,” Tigue said in a statement. “Given the strong reserve positions of health insurers operating in the state, I did not believe that charges for profit and contributions to reserves for 2022 were consistent with the proper conduct of the insurers’ business or consistent with the public interest.” Rhode Islanders will save almost $42 million in 2022 compared to what the commercial health insurers requested, his office said. For Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which has 40,255 members in its small group plan and requested an average rate increase of 2.9%, Tigue approved a 0.3% decrease. Gail Carvelli, a spokesperson for BCBSRI, told The Boston Globe the company accepted the modifications and recognized the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Thursday tossed out a school mask mandate in the capital city, saying it contradicts a state budget measure aimed at preventing face covering requirements. State Attorney General Alan Wilson had sued Columbia after the City Council passed the ordinance requiring masks at elementary and middle schools. City leaders said the mask requirement, which carries a $100 violation fine, was meant to protect children too young to be approved for COVID-19 vaccines. But Wilson argued the city’s mask rule conflicts with the budget requirement that went into effect July 1 and bans school districts from using appropriated funds to require face coverings. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court sided unanimously with the attorney general. The Columbia ordinance is written so that the burden of enforcing the mask rule falls on school employees, “all of whom have an obvious connection to state-appropriated funds,” wrote Justice John Kittredge. That means school employees have to choose between violating state or city laws, the opinion said. “The City has made clear that every school employee is in the crosshairs,” Kittredge wrote.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers looking to remake the state’s voter-passed medical marijuana law previewed a coming battle in the Legislature on Wednesday as they recommended outlawing growing the plant in homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. A legislative subcommittee approved a spate of recommended changes to a ballot measure approved by 70% of voters last year. The law is set to take full effect in the coming months as the state government faces deadlines to issue medical marijuana identification cards and provide for the licensure of dispensaries. However, the law will continue to be in flux. Republicans, who dominate the Legislature, are currently debating just how far to go in changing the law. The subcommittee on Wednesday recommended changes that could potentially make it more difficult for people in rural areas to access the drug – most significantly by striking all provisions allowing medical marijuana ID-card holders to grow cannabis plants in their homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. The recommendations will next face approval by the Marijuana Interim Study Committee before they can be passed to the full Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state Department of Education video celebrating the return to school drew sharp criticism across social media. The 41-second video released Tuesday features Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who shares her own memories of excitedly starting school as a kindergartner. “All of our students – 1 million of them – across the state of Tennessee are starting the school year right now,” Schwinn says. “The smell of new books, clean hallways, the energy and feeling of being back in classrooms with their friends and their teachers. It’s such a special time, and I am so excited for our state.” She then asks parents to share stories about why they are excited for the new school year in the comments. The video received swift feedback from parents and teachers experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, quarantines and a growing number of schools already closing as the coronavirus spreads. As of Wednesday, Tennessee was averaging a record-setting 2,330 infections per day among school-age children, ages 5 to 18, according to state data. “How tone deaf do you have to be to ask parents to ‘share their stories’?” commenter Joshua Allen said on Facebook. Several commenters said they sent kids back to school after 18 months of avoiding the virus only to have their children exposed or infected within a few weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The state on Wednesday became the 20th and largest in the nation to allow some form of the unregulated carry of a firearm. Under the new law, most people 21 or older who haven’t been convicted of a felony can carry a holstered handgun – concealed or otherwise – in public without undergoing any training or getting a permit. Supporters of the law, including Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature, laud it as a necessary expansion of the so-called constitutional carry movement that will allow people to more easily defend themselves without government interference. But critics, including some law enforcement groups and others, say this further loosening of firearms restrictions in a state that has had more than its share of mass shootings is reckless. Until Wednesday, Texans needed a license to carry a handgun outside their homes and vehicles. To get one, they had to submit fingerprints, go through several hours of training on gun laws and gun safety, and pass a shooting proficiency test. Now, they can still take an online training course that the law requires the state to provide, but it is not necessary. While recent mass shootings have put many on edge, Texas has cultivated a strong culture of gun ownership with echoes of the Wild West, and many residents support the loosened restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A suspect charged with setting fire to three churches in the city and then leading police on a high-speed chase across Washington County that didn’t end until he crashed his minivan inside Zion National Park told police he was a “type of deity” who was acting in “righteous anger.” The man was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on seven separate charges, including two second-degree felony counts of arson and a third-degree felony count of failing to stop for a police officer, according to a report filed in 5th District Court. Local fire officials and federal agents had been investigating the string of fires as a possible hate crime, as all three happened at houses of worship of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. The suspect, a 36-year-old identified as Benjamin Johnson, was being held without bail. The police report suggests investigators worried that he could be a danger to the community and that his mental health was a consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A refugee resettlement organization is offering to accept about 100 Afghan refugees over the next several weeks if its proposal is approved by the U.S. State Department. Amila Merdzanovic of the Vermont chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said that if the request is approved, the state’s well-publicized housing crisis will prompt her organization to look for families to host at least some of the new arrivals. It would not be the first time refugees arriving in Vermont lived with host families. “In the 1970s and 1980s when Laotians and Cambodians were coming into the state, there was no refugee resettlement program, so people were being hosted by Vermonters,” said Merdzanovic, who came to Vermont in 1995 as a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina and lived with a host family when she first arrived. “That’s the model we are looking to implement.” She said Thursday that since word of the proposal first became public Wednesday, she has already received dozens of messages of support. Historically, Vermont has not been a location where refugees with the types of visas granted to the Afghans have been resettled. Merdzanovic said last week she was not expecting any Afghans, but she learned Aug. 25 that refugee resettlement agencies had two days to submit proposals.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the state can remove an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a prominent spot in its capital city, saying that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The 7-0 decision cited testimony from historians that the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the Southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. More than a century later, its continued display “communicates principles that many believe to be inconsistent with the values the Commonwealth currently wishes to express,” the justices ruled. The high court’s decision came in two lawsuits filed by residents who attempted to block Gov. Ralph Northam’s order to remove the bronze equestrian sculpture, which shows Lee in military attire atop a massive stone pedestal. Virginia promised to forever maintain the statue in the 1887 and 1890 deeds that transferred its ownership to the state. But the justices said that obligation no longer applies. “Those restrictive covenants are unenforceable as contrary to public policy and for being unreasonable because their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees,” the justices wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, the state’s most populous county is reinstating outdoor mask mandates for large events and strongly encouraging people to wear masks in other outdoor settings when they can’t remain 6 feet apart. In a statement Thursday, Public Health – Seattle & King County said as of Tuesday there will be a requirement for face masks for outdoor events of 500 or more people. The directive applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people over age 5. The recommendation for outdoor masks when people are unable to socially distance from non-household members is also for people 5 and up regardless of vaccination status. “With high rates of disease spread, and our health care system straining to keep up, it is time to take additional steps to keep ourselves and our communities safe,” the health agency said. King County, which includes Seattle, is home to about 2.2 million people. Just last week County Executive Dow Constantine had boasted that King County had one of the highest vaccination rates of any large county in the U.S. As of last week, more than 70% of people 12 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal mine officials have instructed state environmental regulators to propose a change to West Virginia’s mine cleanup program. The federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is giving the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection 60 days to submit an amendment to its reclamation program, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. An Aug. 23 letter from federal officials to state officials said a review found that the program “has not taken sufficient steps” to make sure reclamation obligations are estimated correctly. Such a failure can lead to unfunded environmental liabilities, the letter said. “The WVDEP recognizes the concerns raised in OSMRE’s notice related to reporting and disclosure and those issues will be addressed,” Environmental Protection Department Secretary Harold Ward said in a statement Wednesday, without specifying what kind of amendment the agency plans to submit. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s review of the state’s reclamation program follows lawsuits filed by environmentalist groups.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Calling the situation horrific and inexcusable, city, county and state leaders said this week that they are committed to doing what it takes to improve conditions that leave Black renters in Milwaukee far more vulnerable to electrical fires than anybody else in the city. “These people paid for a place that ultimately took their lives,” said State Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, who represents part of the city most affected by suspected electrical fires. “That’s inexcusable. ... I have no choice but to find a way to get this addressed. I honestly didn’t know that people were literally losing their lives and everything they own like this.” Johnson said she plans to reach out to Gov. Tony Evers’ office and work with colleagues in the Legislature to consider changes that could help tackle the problem. The reaction follows a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that uncovered how suspected electrical fires disproportionately harm Black renters in the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and how systems at all levels of government fail to address the underlying issues. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Evers said. “It’s very disheartening.” Evers said he already has spoken to staff members about potential ways to address the problem, which he blamed largely on legislative changes in the last decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city expects to face labor shortages across all industries as school-related coronavirus cases spike, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Quarantines and illnesses among children are forcing parents to stay home with their kids, according to the paper, and the problem has already caused issues at day cares.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}]}

Parking tag sales, at a modest fee, would provide critically needed support to protect and enhance the visitor experience not just for tomorrow but for generations to come. We appreciate the public's input throughout this process.\"\n\nThe proposal includes $5 for daily parking, $15 for up to seven days and $40 for an annual tag. The rates were determined by comparing similar access on private and public lands, the statement said. The average parking rate in nearby towns where parking fees are charged is $15 per day and $68 per month. In national parks where visitors are charged for parking, the average rate is $9 per day and $50 per year.\n\nVisitors would be required to display a tag on vehicles parked in designated spots within park boundaries. The tag would not guarantee a parking spot at a specific location. Parking would continue to be available on a first-come, first-served basis. In addition, roadside parking would be eliminated to help protect resources, assist traffic flow through congested areas and improve motorist and pedestrian safety.\n\nNoting that it does not charge an entrance fee, the park said parking tags would not be required for motorists who are on scenic drives through the park or use park roads as a commuter route. Pedestrians and cyclists would not be required to purchase parking tags.\n\nBackcountry camping fees would double to $8 per night under the proposal, with a maximum of $40 per camper. The park said such fees have not increased in 10 years while site use has risen to more than 100,000 camper nights per year.\n\nFrontcountry camping fees would be standardized across the park. Nightly family campsite fees would be $30 for primitive sites and $36 for sites with electrical hookups.

The study concluded shorter hourly limits on meters promote vehicle turnover, creating more frequently-open meter spaces.\n\nTraffic engineers also want to expand ways to pay at the meters, like allowing people to pay for their meter via smartphone app.\n\nUnder the current system, city-owned parking meters charge 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. The hourly limits range from two, three, four and 10 hours, and there's four different hourly rates: 45 cents, 60 cents, 75 cents and $1.25.

More than two-thirds of national parks will remain free to enter.\n\nRELATED: A complete list of national park entrance fees.\n\nLocal parks have history of free entry, but shrinking budgets\n\nThe Great Smokies, which has a half-million acres of rugged mountain backcountry across the North Carolina-Tennessee border, was established in the height of the Great Depression, as was the Blue Ridge Parkway, to protect land heavily degraded by logging, create jobs and encourage tourism to the isolated Southern Appalachians.\n\nThe plans to attract people to pretty scenery and spend money has by all accounts worked well.\n\nAn NPS study last year showed that in 2016 visitors to the parkway and the Smokies had more than a $1 billion impact on the surrounding communities.\n\nBut as visitation increases, putting more pressure on everything from trails to visitor centers to clogged motor roads, park budgets have not kept pace, and the maintenance bills keep piling up.\n\nIn the Smokies, the maintenance backlog has reached $215 million, spokeswoman Dana Soehn said. The backlog includes repairing and rebuilding roads in the nearly 90-year-old park, rehabilitating buildings and upgrading wastewater facilities, and replacing vital communications equipment including emergency radios.\n\nThis year the park raised its front-country campground fees for the first time in more than a decade. The park retains 100 percent of the camping and pavilion fees to operate these facilities, provide visitor services and fund projects such as replacing picnic tables and grills, Soehn said.\n\nNo other fees are planned.\n\nThe land comprising Great Smoky Mountains National Park was once privately owned. Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as local communities, paid to construct Newfound Gap Road/U.S. 441. When the state of Tennessee transferred ownership of Newfound Gap Road to the federal government, it stipulated that \"no toll or license fee shall ever be imposed…\" to travel the road.\n\n\n\nAction by the Tennessee legislature would be required to lift this deed restriction if the Smokies ever planned to charge an entrance fee.\n\nRELATED: Great Smoky Mountain National Park camping fees to increase\n\nRELATED: Smokies needs help to replace aged-out emergency response radios\n\nRELATED: Blue Ridge Parkway views get major restoration with 'Renew the Views' project\n\nMaintenance backlogs on the parkway, which runs 469 miles from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to the Smokies’ entrance in Cherokee, total $462 million, said spokeswoman Leesa Brandon.\n\n“We are not considering implementing fees at the parkway,” Brandon said. “However, 20 percent of the entrance fee revenue from other parks supports enhancing visitor services and deferred maintenance at parks that do not collect fees.”\n\nThere are no plans to charge an entrance fee in any current planning documents or projects at Carl Sandburg either, said Sarah Perschall, chief of visitor services.\n\nAll three WNC national parks rely heavily on nonprofit partners for funding.\n\nEntrance fees collected by the National Park Service totaled $199 million in fiscal year 2016.

Therefore, White Sands will modify its entrance fees to provide additional funding for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nEffective Jan. 1, 2019, the entrance fees to the park will be $20 per vehicle, $10 per person and $15 per motorcycle.\n\nFor instance, a car with three passengers would pay the $20 per vehicle fee and not $30 for the three individual passengers.\n\nThere are also five fee-free days each year.\n\nIn 2019, the fee-free days are Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21; the first day National Park Week, April 20; National Park Service Anniversary Day, Aug. 25; National Public Lands Day, Sept. 28; and Veterans Day, Nov. 11.\n\nAccording to the release, all of the money received from entrance fees remains with the National Park Service with 80 percent of the revenue staying at White Sands.\n\nThe revenue from entrance fees at White Sands has enabled rehabilitation of the monument’s 1930s era sewage system and replacement of all cedar rail fences. Currently, needed repairs to the park’s accessible Interdune Boardwalk trail and restoration of the porch poles of the historic Spanish pueblo-adobe visitor center are in progress, the release states.\n\nEntrance fees collected by White Sands for the last 10 years have totaled $4.6 million and have been used to add new vault restrooms and picnic shelters in the dunes area, install new museum exhibits in 2010, add new interpretive signage to road pull-offs and hiking trails, and develop education curriculum for K-12 students, the release states.\n\nWhite Sands has charged an entrance fee since 1937 and the current rate of $5 per person has been in effect since 2016.\n\nThe park is one of 117 National Park Service sites that charge an entrance fee; the other 301 national parks remain free to enter.\n\nThe National Park Service has a standardized entrance fee structure, composed of four groups based on park size and type. Some parks not yet aligned with the other parks in their category will raise their fees incrementally and fully incorporate the new entrance fee schedule by Jan. 1, 2020, according to the release.\n\n\n\nThe National Park Service cares for special places saved by the American people so that all may experience our heritage.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2019, the complete fee schedule at White Sands will change according to the following: $20 per vehicle, $10 per person, $15 per motorcycle and $40 for Park Specific Annual Pass. These rates will go up by $5 in 2020.\n\nThe price of annual America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Annual Pass and Lifetime Senior Pass will remain $80.

Phil Murphy announced in May that any state resident who has at least one shot by July 4 can get a free state parks pass, which would cost $50 for residents this year.\n\nThe 100,000 signups is up from nearly 50,000 earlier this month, weeks after the program was announced, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees New Jersey’s parks. It dwarfs the roughly 5,000 annual passes typically purchased in a year.\n\nAlthough it’s not clear how many people were motivated to become vaccinated by the free parks pass, the state eclipsed its goal of 4.7 million vaccinations last week amid the allurement.\n\nThe COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 already had more people heading outdoors, as the number of Americans who went hiking last year rose by 8.1 million, the largest one-year gain on record, according to the Outdoor Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Outdoor Industry Association.\n\nOn a recent weekday, a parking lot at Island Beach State Park, a 10-mile (16-kilometer) stretch of mostly undeveloped shoreline and one of the state’s most popular beaches, was packed but not filled to capacity. The beach-side bar at the park was humming with patrons. Colorful umbrellas flapped in the ocean breeze.\n\nThe Department of Environmental Protection urges park-goers to arrive early to be sure of a spot in parks like Island Beach that frequently reach capacity — as passes don’t guarantee entry.\n\nLinda Jakuboski, of Pine Beach, said she’s been coming to Island Beach for 35 years and noticed it seemed busier than usual for a weekday. She didn’t get the vaccine pass incentive, but did get the shot. If the spike in annual passes leads to crowding, she’s prepared to get there early and frequent one of the less crowded sections of the beach.\n\n“I’m just so used to being here. This is home,” she said. “This is like a second home, really.”\n\nBob Smith, a retiree from nearby Manchester, said he’s a newcomer to Island Beach but was impressed enough to buy an annual pass. He didn’t get the incentive but did get vaccinated, he said.\n\nIf things get crowded, he’ll just enjoy the pool at the 55-plus community where he lives, he said. But the crowds weren’t a big concern now that more people are vaccinated.\n\n“It’s nice to see people’s faces,” he said.\n\nRoughly 70% of adults are vaccinated in the state. Most of the COVID-19 restrictions like face masks have ended.\n\nAfaf Muhammad, of Jersey City, has been camping for years and got her two daughters involved with Team Wilderness, a Jersey City-based nonprofit aimed at getting Black and other kids of color outdoors.\n\nShe opted not to get the vaccine, but praised the idea of getting more people, especially people of color, outdoors. The Outdoors Foundation study found that three-quarters of people doing outdoor activities are white.\n\n“I think that’s so important for children to be in fresh air. We live in public housing. You don’t really see too many trees and grass here,” she said. “You’re not going to see too much real nature. (City) parks aren’t really nature reserves like a state park would be.”\n\nHer daughter Aracelis Hannah is 18, and started Team Wilderness trips five years ago. She, too, opted not to get the vaccine, but said people should take advantage of state parks.\n\n“You don’t know what the wilderness could do to you, to change you … to make you more observant of your surroundings,” she said.\n\nMore:5 national parks you'll feel like you have all to yourself\n\nMore:Headed to Delaware beaches this weekend? What you need to know about parking, dining and more\n\nJuan Melli, an avid hiker and senior vice president at the public affairs firm Mercury, said he got the vaccine pass, but would have gotten the vaccine even without the incentive. He’s noticed more people on hiking trails around the state since the program started.\n\n“Exposing people to outdoors — I think COVID did that anyway: Your weekend plans are canceled. There’s no where to shop so what can you do? You can go outside,” he said. “So if it raises awareness that’s great.\n\n“I just hope this gets people thinking more about the outdoors.”\n\nAsked whether the state’s parks could handle the jump in annual pass holders, DEP spokesperson Caryn Shinske said in an emailed statement that the parks see millions of visitors a year.\n\nAttendance in 2020 was about 14 million, down from 17 million, though parks were closed for about a month starting in April and admittance was limited because of COVID-19.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/04/12/national-parks-fees-interior-department/513395002/", "title": "Interior Department backs down from proposed national parks fees", "text": "Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — The Interior Department is increasing fees at the most popular national parks to $35 per vehicle, backing down from an earlier plan that would have forced visitors to pay $70 per vehicle to visit the Grand Canyon, Yosemite and other iconic parks.\n\nA change announced Thursday will boost fees at 17 popular parks by $5, up from the current $30 but far below the figure Interior proposed last fall.\n\nThe plan by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke drew widespread opposition from lawmakers and governors of both parties, who said the higher fees could exclude many Americans from enjoying national parks. The agency received more than 109,000 comments on the plan, most of them opposed.\n\nMost of the rate hikes take effect June 1, the National Park Service said. The $35 fee applies mostly in the West and will affect such popular parks as Yellowstone, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Mount Rainier, Rocky Mountain and Grand Teton parks, among others.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the fee hikes were needed to help maintain the parks and begin to address an $11.6 billion maintenance backlog.\n\n“Every dollar spent to rebuild our parks will help bolster the gateway communities that rely on park visitation for economic vitality,” Zinke said.\n\nZinke thanked those who made their voices heard through the public comment process: “Your input has helped us develop a balanced plan that focuses on modest increases,” he said.\n\nThe maintenance backlog “isn’t going to be solved overnight and will require a multi-tiered approach as we work to provide badly needed revenue to repair infrastructure,” Zinke added.\n\nTheresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Park Conservation Association, hailed the new fee structure.\n\n“The public spoke, and the administration listened,” she said, noting that the plan to nearly triple fees at popular parks was opposed by a range of businesses, gateway communities, governors, tourism groups, conservation organizations and the public.\n\nThe revised fee plan is “a big win for park lovers everywhere,” said Rep.

Parks that previously charged $15 will now charge $20; a $20 fee will rise to $25; and a $25 fee will now be $30.\n\nThe current $30 fee is the highest charged by the park service and applies to the 17 most-visited parks.

Odenkirk originated the sleazy lawyer on Breaking Bad in 2009, in what he was told was going to be a brief, three-episode arc, but Goodman proved to be such a popular character that he remained on the series for the rest of its run. Almost immediately following Breaking Bad, Saul became the titular character in the AMC spinoff prequel Better Call Saul.

Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\n\nProduction this season has been fraught with off-screen drama, including delays due to COVID-19 and a brief production hiatus after Odenkirk suffered a heart attack last July, but Odenkirk has recovered and the show’s final season (which will reportedly feature Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul playing their Breaking Bad characters Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, though additional details on the season are scarce) has wrapped production. The show will be available to watch on cable on AMC, but cord-cutters don’t have to worry: There are ways to stream the final season of Better Call Saul.\n\n► Spring Deals: The best spring deals you can shop today\n\nWhere Can You Stream Better Call Saul?\n\nBetter Call Saul is also available to stream on AMC+, the streaming service that offers hundreds of episodes of acclaimed series featured on AMC, from the sly ‘60s drama Mad Men to the intense action of The Walking Dead.

All of that content is topped off with series produced by BBC America, Shudder and IFC Films Unlimited. Plans for AMC+ are available for $6.99 a month with a free 7-day trial period for first-time subscribers, and no cable subscription is necessary to subscribe.\n\nSeason six of Better Call Saul will also be available on Sling TV, the first app-based TV service that allows you to stream live television and on-demand content on the internet.

The second half of season six, consisting of six episodes, premieres on Monday, July 11. Over the last five seasons, we’ve seen the progression of Odenkirk’s character, who starts as a criminal defense lawyer named Jimmy McGill, as he slowly becomes more involved with the criminal world and as he grows into the role of a savvy con-man and assumes the name Saul Goodman (a play on the phrase “It’s all good, man”). In this final season, show creator Vinge Gilligan has confirmed that we will see Saul as he meets Breaking Bad’s Walter White and Jesse Pinkman (Cranston and Paul), narrowing the time-gap between the two shows.\n\nHow To Sign Up For AMC+ and Sling\n\nAMC+ is available as a standalone subscription through the channel’s website, or through your cable provider, starting at $6.99 a month.\n\nVerizon is also offering 12 months of AMC+ access for free to new and existing customers who purchase one of their 5G smartphones with a device payment plan on a Play More, Do More, or Get More Unlimited plan.

But not every TV show is right for every viewer in this tumultuous era (now is probably not a good time to watch HBO's \"The Leftovers,\" wonderful as it may be).\n\nHere are 100 TV shows worth watching while practicing social distancing, whether you want to laugh, bond with your kids or finally discover what's behind the hype about all those \"must watch\" shows your friends are obsessed with.\n\nWhen you need something, unabashedly, positively joyful\n\n1. \"The Carol Burnett Show\" (Amazon) There are a multitude of series from the mid-20th century available to stream, when TV was a positive affair across the board. We're partial to the timeless sketch comedy of Burnett, an American treasure.\n\n2. \"Fixer Upper\" (Hulu) Chip and Joanna Gaines, their sweet kiddos, many adorable pets and can-do attitude may just give you the confidence you need to get through a tough time.\n\n3. \"Gilmore Girls\" (Netflix) Although the Gilmore family has plenty of trials and tribulations, the world of quaint small-town Stars Hollow is usually upbeat in this beloved dramedy.\n\n4. \"The Great British Baking Show\" (Netflix) Warm, friendly and with a focus on decent people doing their best (and doing their best to help each other), this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made.\n\n5. \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\" (Disney+) A farcical mockumentary about a high school putting on a production of \"High School Musical,\" the stakes are low in this Disney+ series, though they seem very high (teenagers and their hormones, of course).\n\n6. \"Making It\" (Hulu) The closest thing the USA has to \"Baking Show,\" the series manages to find sweetness in its crafting, plus a whole lot of overalls for Amy Poehler to wear.\n\n7. \"Parks and Recreation\" (Netflix, Hulu or Amazon) Nothing can stop Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), not even a pandemic. NBC's workplace sitcom is an inspiring stalwart in this genre, full of generally good people trying to do good things.\n\n8. \"Puppy Prep\" (Hulu) A short-form documentary series about service dogs in training, \"Puppy Prep\" is like injecting furry joy right into your veins.\n\n9. \"Queer Eye\" (Netflix) Inspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles; all those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can in a week.\n\n10. \"Schitt's Creek\" (Netflix) Full of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains a little perspective is always a mood booster. (New episodes on Pop Tuesdays, 9 EDT/PDT; series finale airs April.)\n\nWhen you want to travel to a new world\n\n11. “Battlestar Galactica” (Syfy) A bold, breathtaking space opera that is one of the best shows made in response to 9/11; you won't be able to stop hitting \"next episode.\"\n\n12. “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (Hulu) The story of a 16-year-old charged with protecting the world from supernatural evil is a genuine classic, and most fantasy TV series still sit in its large, fanged shadow, more than 20 years after its debut.\n\n13. “Charmed” (Netflix) The late '90s/early 2000s fashions alone makes \"Charmed\" a nostalgia trip, but the sweet family stories and (slightly silly) demons also help.\n\n14. “A Discovery of Witches” (Sundance Now) A quick, immensely satisfying binge-watch for fans of \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"Outlander,\" the series, based on the \"All Souls\" book trilogy, nails a fantasy romance.\n\n15. “Doctor Who” (BBC America and BritBox) With more than 50 years of time-and-space traveling episodes, there is no limit to where (or when) the Doctor (currently embodied by Jodi Whittaker) can take you in this British institution.\n\n16. “The Expanse” (Amazon) Set in a slightly nearer future than many sci-fi epics, \"Expanse\" marries politics and space battles in the story of a future when we populate the solar system but remain culturally divided.\n\n17. “The Magicians” (Netflix and Syfy) Something of an R-rated hybrid of \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" the superb fantasy series follows a group of adult magicians who discover a fictional world from popular children's books is real – and dangerous.\n\n18. “The Mandalorian” (Disney+) The first live-action \"Star Wars\" TV series lived up to the storied franchise, and not just because of Baby Yoda.\n\nMore:You can get a huge deal if you sign up for this Disney+ bundle\n\n19. “Outlander” (Starz, Netflix) The sweeping, time-traveling romance verges on the melodramatic with its century-hopping plot, but it barely matters as the central love story never loses its chemistry or verve.\n\n20. “Star Trek: The Next Generation” (or any \"Trek\") (CBS All Access, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu) A winning combination of great science-fiction storytelling and a sense of hope and optimism, the \"Trek\" franchise is the kind of inspiration we could all use right now, and \"Next Generation\" remains the best of the bunch.\n\n21. “Wynonna Earp” (Netflix and Syfy) If you've already seen \"Buffy,\" try this similar story of a super-powered young woman protecting her small town, this time a descendant of Wyatt Earp charged with keeping his undead enemies at bay.\n\nWhen you want to watch a comedy with the whole family\n\n22. “Black-ish” (Hulu) Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross do some of their best work as the parents in an upper-middle class black family in this hilarious and profound sitcom.\n\n23. “The Big Bang Theory” (local stations and TBS, available to buy digitally) The hangout sitcom starring Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco was TV's most popular show for a reason – its big, broad humor and nerdy characters are comforting and familiar.\n\n24. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” (Hulu) If you've already seen \"Parks and Recreation,\" try this similar workplace comedy, set in a police precinct, from the same producer with the same upbeat tone.\n\n25. “Community” (Hulu until March 31; Netflix April 1) This slightly zany comedy about a group of diverse friends attending a local community college has its ups and downs, but its funniest, most ambitious installments are among the best TV episodes ever made.\n\n26. “Friends” (local stations, TBS; available to buy digitally) The hugely popular sitcom isn't streaming anywhere until HBO Max debuts in late spring, but catch it on TV to hang out with Monica, Joey, Chandler, Rachel, Phoebe and Ross.\n\n27. “Golden Girls” (Hulu) They don't make them like they used to, right? A visit from Dorothy, Rose, Blanche and Sophia is always funny and calming, no matter if you're just discovering the beloved sitcom or rewatching it.\n\n28. “Jane the Virgin” (Netflix) The telenovela-style story of a virgin who's artificially inseminated by accident started strong and rode high for five excellent seasons. Although the moving series is more a dramedy than a laugh-out-loud sitcom, its moments of joy and levity are plentiful.\n\n29. “The Middle” (IMDb TV) Never as flashy as its ABC family-sitcom cousins, \"Middle\" is a stalwart, sweet comedy with great performances and nine long seasons to binge-watch.\n\n30. “Modern Family” (Hulu; ABC, Wednesdays, 9 EDT/PDT; local stations and USA Network) The Emmy-winning series has an incredible cast and relatable laughs for families and married couples. And if you hurry, you can catch up on all 11 seasons before ABC's April 8 series finale.\n\n31. “The Office” (Netflix) There is just no getting sick of the ultimate workplace sitcom, no matter how many times you watch Michael Scott burn his foot on a George Foreman grill.\n\n32. “One Day at a Time” (Netflix) Like the Norman Lear original, this family sitcom, about a Cuban-American family in Los Angeles, is expert at combining a frank discussion of social issues with hilarity (new episodes on Pop TV, Tuesdays, 9:30 EDT/PDT).\n\n33. “Speechless” (Hulu) Gone too soon after just three seasons, this comedy about a family in which one son has cerebral palsy is representation of disability like you've never seen before, with searing satire and riotous laughs.\n\n34. “Superstore” (Hulu; NBC) This series, about employees at a big box store, is something of a modern day \"Cheers,\" a workplace comedy set outside a traditional white-collar office in a place we all have wandered into at some point. (The blue vests of the fictional Cloud 9 store might remind you of a certain chain).\n\nWhen you want to watch a comedy after the kids go to bed\n\n35. “30 Rock” (Amazon, Hulu) Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan make an endlessly appealing trio in this award-winning series about a \"Saturday Night Live\"-style sketch comedy series.\n\n36. “Catastrophe” (Amazon) For fans of dry British humor who feel stable in their marriages, this sitcom from Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan is a beautiful portrait of a relationship that begins with an unplanned pregnancy but becomes so much more.\n\n37. “Cheers” (Netflix) You can't visit a real bar right now, but you can still go where everybody knows your name in this classic NBC comedy starring Ted Danson.\n\n38. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” (Netflix) CW's poignant musical comedy about one woman's (Rachel Bloom) mental health struggles has a tune for every emotion, and you'll be happy to hum them for weeks after finishing all four seasons.\n\n39. “Don’t Trust the B**** in Apt. 23” (Hulu) This quirky series about a nightmare roommate didn't last long on ABC, but made great comedy while it was on, with Krysten Ritter and James Van Der Beek, playing a fictional version of himself.\n\n40. “Happy Endings (Hulu) One of the many \"Friends\"-like hangout sitcoms to emerge over the past two decades, \"Endings\" is on the quirkier, more heightened side, following five 30-somethings in Chicago.\n\n41. “High Maintenance” (HBO) Because there’s only one recurring character – a New York weed dealer – in every episode, you can start anywhere in this HBO anthology series and always know you’re going to get a tight episode that shows a slice of life with authentic dialogue and gorgeous cinematography.\n\n42. “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” (Hulu) If you like crass, cringe comedy, there are over 150 episodes that lovingly poke at Philly, with a lot of mishaps along the way.\n\n43. “Key & Peele” (Hulu) If you're more interested in morsels of comedy rather than long narratives, this Comedy Central sketch show, which jumpstarted the careers of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, is perfect and requires very little commitment to get a laugh.\n\n44. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (Amazon) With mile-a-minute dialogue, impeccable costumes and an incredible cast, this dramedy about a 1950s housewife (Rachel Brosnahan) turned stand-up comic is a pastel pink-covered treat.\n\n45. “Mom” (CBS All Access, Hulu) Anna Faris and Allison Janney deliver smart comedy about family and addiction in producer Chuck Lorre's (\"Big Bang Theory\") best (but most underrated) CBS sitcom.\n\n46. “Seinfeld” (Hulu) If you've never seen Jerry Seinfeld's landmark show about nothing, it's a great time to start. You might want to skip the disappointing series finale, though.\n\n47. “Veep” (Amazon, HBO Go/HBO Now) Some of the political satire's bite has faded as our world has become more absurd and shocking, but that doesn't dull the sharpness of star Julia Louis-Dreyfus's performance.\n\nWhen you want a taste of reality\n\n48. “The Bachelor/Bachelorette” (Netflix, Hulu) If the bachelors and bachelorettes of ABC's long-running reality dating franchise can find love in a hopeless place (like in front of millions of TV viewers), then there's hope for the rest of us, too.\n\n49. “Blown Away” (Netflix) Watching artists blow glass might seem like watching paint dry, but it's a fascinating and soothing sight to behold in this competition show.\n\n50. “Chopped” (Hulu) If you need inspiration on how to turn random pantry ingredients into a delicious meal, Food Network's competition series, in which four chefs cook with odd and challenging mystery ingredients, might get you to zest up your pasta.\n\n51. “The Big Family Cooking Showdown” (Netflix) The positivity and focus on good, old fashioned home cooking makes this show, with British families competing to be named the best, stand out among its hyper-competitive peers.\n\n52. “House Hunters” (Hulu) If you prefer reality TV that's less sappy and more voyeuristic, HGTV's real estate series lets you judge the choices of home buyers across the country.\n\n53. “MasterChef Junior” (Hulu) Almost any reality series is improved by swapping out boring adults for adorable (and talented) children, and this pint-sized version of the amateur chef competition is far sweeter than the original.\n\n54. “Project Runway” (Hulu) The first four seasons of the original fashion reality show are a perfect mix of artistry and drama, although later ones, with help from mentor Christian Siriano, are almost as wonderful.\n\n55. “Survivor” (CBS All Access) It's hard to travel or escape from the news while social distancing, but CBS's survival series offers glimpses of far-off landscapes, and peeks into the human psyche.\n\n56. “Top Chef” (Hulu) There are dozens of food shows and chef competitions on the air, but this Bravo staple remains the best, pitting a group of chefs in a series of grueling competitions.\n\nWhen you want to bond with the teens (and still be entertained)\n\n57. “American Vandal” (Netflix) The rare series in which teen problems are taken seriously, \"Vandal\" is also a hilarious mockumentary that pokes at overly serious true-crime documentaries like \"Making a Murderer.\"\n\n58. “Beverly Hills, 90210” (Hulu) With big drama and even bigger hair, the 1990s high school staple has inspired many shows, but nothing beats the original (or Luke Perry's sideburns).\n\n59. “Derry Girls” (Netflix) This Irish series, best watched with subtitles, follows a group of Catholic teens in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, a period of religious violence in the region. The series is a great comedy about trying to live a daily life amid social unrest and upheaval.\n\n60. \"The Fosters\" (Netflix) The series follows an interracial lesbian couple with a mix of biological, adopted and foster children, and the unique challenges and emotions that come with that kind of family.\n\n61. \"Friday Night Lights\" (Hulu) The drama on NBC's acclaimed high school football series is undeniably one of the best shows to binge-watch, equally entertaining for teens and adults.\n\n62. “My So-Called Life” (ABC.com, IMDb TV) This short-lived 1994-95 Claire Danes series is one of the best portraits of teen emotion and angst, not to mention the very real traumas that adolescence brings.\n\n63. “The O.C.” (Netflix) Travel, via your TV screen, to California and spend some time with Summer, Seth, Ryan and Marissa. Relive the drama and romance when a working-class kid moves in with a rich family. (But skip the last season.)\n\n64. “Pretty Little Liars (Netflix) Although this soapy thriller sometimes goes off the rails, early seasons are gripping and addictive, spinning delicate webs with the mystery of the disappearance of a teen girl, her left-behind friends and their mysterious harasser.\n\n65. “Riverdale” (Netflix; CW, Wednesdays 8 EDT/PDT) \"Riverdale\" takes pages out of the \"Liars\" playbook when it comes to mixing murder with teen hormones, but its Archie Comics inspiration makes it a familiarly fascinating series.\n\nWhen adult animation beckons\n\n66. “Archer” (Hulu) Spy games are never funnier (or sillier) than in this FXX series, which features the voices of Judy Greer, H. John Benjamin and Chris Parnell.\n\n67. “Bob’s Burgers” (Hulu) Heartfelt, offbeat and full of visual humor, the series about a family and its burger joint is the model of modern adult animation.\n\n68. “BoJack Horseman” (Netflix) Not the cheeriest comedy, but one of the most affecting, Netflix’s showbiz satire found unexpected depths by juxtaposing animated, bipedal animals dealing with serious contemporary issues.\n\n69. “The Simpsons” (Disney+; Fox, Sundays, 8 EDT/PDT) Disney+ isn't all princesses and Pixar – the entire library of this seminal comedy is ready for you to stream at a time in which the quirks of Springfield feel less odd than real life.\n\nWhen you want to hang with detectives and lawyers\n\n70. “Alias Grace” (Netflix) A stunning miniseries based on Margaret Atwood's historical fiction novel, \"Grace\" adds new layers to the case of Canada's most infamous accused murderess.\n\n71. “American Crime Story” (Netflix) Whether you tune to the O.J. Simpson or Gianni Versace season of the FX true-crime anthology series, you'll find sharp writing and a dissection of recent historical events from new perspectives.\n\n72. \"Damages\" (Hulu) Glenn Close plays a high-powered lawyer, with Rose Byrne her young protégé, and each serialized season deals with a different case, which separates it from other legal dramas.\n\n73. “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” (Amazon, CBS All Access) Whether your lead character is Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) or Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), these dramas about Chicago lawyers are enthralling.\n\n74. “Law & Order: SVU” (Amazon; NBC, Thursdays, 10 EDT/PDT) There's a comforting sameness to the hundreds of \"SVU\" episodes: Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) investigates the crime, finds her perp, justice is served. It's an appealing simplicity right now.\n\n75. “Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries” (Amazon, AcornTV) This delightful Australian romp finds the eponymous Miss Fisher (Essie Davis) solving crimes in her best flapper attire in 1920s Melbourne.\n\n76. “NYPD Blue” (Hulu, Amazon) So many cop shows are derivative and basic that it can be hard to remember series like \"Blue,\" which transcended the genre as it followed Detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and the rest of the 15th Precinct as they investigated homicides.\n\nWhen you want to finally figure out what all the fuss is about\n\n77. “The Americans” (Amazon) The best show of the 2010s is a delicate portrait of two Soviet spies (Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) working undercover in suburban Washington, D.C., that's also a layered examination of family and marriage.\n\n78. “Atlanta” (Hulu) Donald Glover’s audacious series about a college-dropout father trying to climb the economic ladder as a manager for his rapper cousin (Brian Tyree Henry) is proof of the multi-talented artist's creative prowess.\n\n79. “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” (Netflix; \"Saul\" also on AMC, Mondays, 10 EDT/PDT) \"Bad,\" with its celebrated Bryan Cranston performance as a high school teacher turned drug kingpin, is the quintessential antihero tale. Spinoff prequel \"Saul\" is just as good (or sometimes even better).\n\n80. “Fargo” (Hulu) FX's superb anthology crime series, based on the Coen Brothers movie, captures the spirit of the film in each distinctive season.\n\n81. “Fleabag” (Amazon) Hilarious, emotional and utterly surprising, the British comedy from Phoebe Waller Bridge, in which she stars as a struggling young woman, deserves the hype (and all those Emmys).\n\n82. “Game of Thrones” (HBO Go/HBO Now) If you have resisted the pull of the blockbuster fantasy series, now is the perfect time to decide for yourself if it was worth the buzz. But you can probably skip the final season, unless you want to know why so many left it so angry.\n\n83. “The Good Place” (Netflix, Hulu) The recently ended afterlife sitcom feels like a dose of palliative care with its bright colors, puns and visual gags. Underneath its appealing aesthetics, \"Place\" has great performances, great writing and some sincere thoughts about ethics and philosophy.\n\n84. “Halt and Catch Fire” (Netflix) What started as as a “Mad Men” knockoff about the 1980s computer industry morphed into a complex story about communication, connection and women's struggles to achieve power at home and work.\n\n85. “Insecure” (HBO) Issa Rae crafts a distinctly millennial series in this HBO comedy about a black woman in Los Angeles who questions her life decisions, including her long-term boyfriend.\n\n86. “Justified” (Hulu) Timothy Olyphant is at his absolute best in this cowboy tale of a U.S. Marshal with his own code of justice and deep ties to criminals in his small Kentucky town.\n\n87. “Mad Men” (Netflix) Full of metaphor, gorgeous 1960s costumes and set design, and fine performances from Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss, \"Mad\" was so much more than catchy ad copy.\n\n88. “The Sopranos” (HBO Go/HBO Now, Amazon) The New Jersey mobster drama that launched a thousand antihero knockoffs still has punch (pun intended) two decades after its debut.\n\n89. “Twin Peaks” and “Twin Peaks: The Return” (Netflix, Showtime) ABC's mystical murder mystery from director David Lynch was a phenomenon in the 1990s and returned on Showtime in 2018 as one of the most creatively successful TV revivals in our current glut of rehashes.\n\n90.“The West Wing” (Netflix) The simplicity of politics in Aaron Sorkin's White House drama feels almost quaint in 2020, but the rousing speeches of President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) still inspire and captivate.\n\n91. “The Wire” (HBO Go/HBO Now, Amazon) Touted by many as the best TV show of all time, writer David Simon's meticulous crime drama is gorgeously wrought and acted by the likes of Dominic West, Idris Elba and Michael B. Jordan.\n\nWhen you need soapy drama to keep you glued to the screen\n\n92. \"24\" (Hulu) Kiefer Sutherland's Fox espionage thriller is unparalleled in maintaining the tension and keeping stakes high. It's exactly the kind of distraction we need right now.\n\n93. \"Downton Abbey\" (Amazon) What makes the period drama – about an upper-class British family in the early 20th century and its \"downstairs\" household staff – so riveting is the way it dresses up soapy drama in high-class clothes: a little trashy, a little classy and a lot of Maggie Smith asking what a \"weekend\" is. (Be warned, part of Season 2 covers the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, so steer clear if that hits too close to home right now.)\n\n94. \"Homeland\" (Hulu or Showtime) Especially in its initial, acclaimed season, \"Homeland\" was full of twists, turns and cliffhangers that kept us fervently watching.\n\n95. \"Power\" (Hulu, Starz) \"Power\" is so melodramatic it rivals some daytime soaps, and each absurdity makes it more fun to watch. It follows James \"Ghost\" St. Patrick (Omari Hardwick), a nightclub owner and drug kingpin with plenty of money and problems.\n\n96. \"Scandal\" (Netflix) Shonda Rhimes' series became a sensation with its lightning-fast plot and Oval Office relationship drama, and while the series eventually tapered off, those first few seasons had enough shock, awe and giant wine glasses to keep viewers hungry for more.\n\n97. \"True Blood\" (HBO Go/HBO Now, Amazon) HBO's Louisiana vampire series has everything you need: big-name talent (Anna Paquin, Alexander Skarsgaard, Joe Manganiello), wild plots (fairies! psychics! humidity!) and a whole lot of blood (synthetic or otherwise).\n\n98. \"You\" (Netflix) Penn Badgley is at his creepy best in Netflix's drama about a \"nice guy\" who's really a murderous stalker manipulating his way into the lives of his victims.\n\nWhen you want to learn something\n\n99. “Country Music” (PBS) Ken Burns turned his famous documentarian's eye to a distinct piece of Americana in this calming chronicle of the rise of country music.\n\n100. “O.J.: Made in America” (Hulu, ESPN) If the \"ACS\" fictional retelling of O.J. Simpson's story has you interested in the topic, this epic Oscar- and Emmy-winning documentary tells not only Simpson's history but the history of race in 20th-century America.\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/01/08/tv-spinoffs-10-best-and-five-worst-all-time-fosters-goldbergs-joey-colbert-report-good-fight/2472040002/", "title": "TV spinoffs: The 10 best and five worst of all time", "text": "If at first you do succeed, try, try again.\n\nTelevision spinoffs, which seem to have been around since the invention of the cathode-ray tube, are in the spotlight again with this week's premieres of ABC's \"Schooled\" (Wednesday, 8:30 EST/PST), which jumps from '80s-something \"The Goldbergs\" into the next decade, and Freeform's \"Good Trouble\" (Tuesday, 8 EST/PST), which follows two of the now grown-up kids from \"The Fosters,\" now in Los Angeles.\n\nOf the legion of offshoot alternatives, some have spun peripheral concepts into gold. Others simply became canceled dross. Our take on the best and the worst:\n\nThe best\n\n'The Colbert Report' (Comedy Central)\n\nThere's a reason Comedy Central has been having such trouble filling the post-\"Daily Show\" timeslot in recent years – nothing can be better than the original. \"The Colbert Report\" seems more like a fact of life than a spinoff in retrospect, but its origins are in Stephen Colbert's Bill O'Reilly parody from his time as a correspondent on \"The Daily Show.\" Only a comedian with Colbert's talent could take a one-joke persona and turn it into multiple seasons of successful television, books and marches on Washington. When the comedian put aside his frameless glasses to helm CBS's \"The Late Show,\" we lost more than a half-hour of weekly comedy. We lost the \"Stephen Colbert\" we'd come to love.\n\n'The Good Fight' (CBS All Access)\n\nIf there's one gleaming reason for the CBS All Access streaming service to exist, it's this wonderful spinoff of CBS drama \"The Good Wife.\" \"The Good Fight\" gave Christine Baranski's Diane Lockhart her own forum as she and Chicago's best lawyers attempt to function in the post-President Trump era. The series has everything that made \"Wife\" great, and none of the tics that made it frustrating. Plus, free of the FCC broadcast restrictions, \"Fight\" is dirtier and more profane than its predecessor, and unapologetic about political storylines. At this point, \"Wife\" feels like it was just a warmup for creators Robert and Michelle King.\n\n'Daria' (MTV)\n\nThe sullen teen Daria Morgendorffer (voiced by Tracy Grandstaff) appeared sporadically on \"Beavis and Butt-head,\" but in her own series, she finally began to shine (although she was still pretty sullen). The clever series, which lampooned the idea that someone would actually like high school, has achieved cult status over the years, and Daria has given voice to a generation of disaffected, too-cool-for-school '90s kids.\n\n'Xena: Warrior Princess' (Syndicated)\n\nFew probably remember \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,\" but its spinoff, \"Xena: Warrior Princess,\" is a pop-culture touchstone that's easily identifiable even if you've never seen an episode. \"Xena\" outstripped \"Hercules\" in every way, from the magnetic talent of stars Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor to its irresistible campiness.\n\n'Angel' (WB)\n\nBefore he was an FBI agent or a Navy SEAL, David Boreanaz was Angel, a 200-year-old vampire with a soul, a brooding, gorgeous love interest for Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\" Recognizing Boreanaz's star potential early, \"Buffy\" creator Joss Whedon spun him off into this darker, more mature take on the supernatural than \"Buffy.\" \"Angel\" was never quite as good as \"Buffy,\" but it skated through many peaks, valleys and cast changes because of Boreanaz's charm.\n\n‘Maude,’ ‘Good Times’ and ‘The Jeffersons’ (CBS)\n\nThese three 1970s sitcoms form the greatest group of spinoffs, all descending from Norman Lear’s masterpiece “All in the Family.” The trio dealt with the same hot-button social issues that revolutionized TV in that era. We rate “Maude” at the top of the pyramid, based on Beatrice Arthur’s tour de force performance as a liberal suburbanite waging an early war against the patriarchy while battling her own prejudices and hubris. “Good Times” was the rare show that looked at the struggles of a poor black family led by Maude's former maid, the powerful Florida (Esther Rolle), before it was “dyn-o-mited” by the success of Jimmie Walker’s catchphrase. “The Jeffersons” touched on race, prosperity and pursuit of the American dream, but compact powerhouse George Jefferson (Sherman Helmsley) also brought a physical humor that just made us laugh.\n\n'Boston Legal' (ABC)\n\nThe city stayed the same, and so did the setting – a law firm – but David E. Kelley’s offbeat “Boston Legal” succeeded largely because tonally, it was worlds apart from “The Practice,” a serious, frequently dark look at gritty legal maneuvering. The wry James Spader succeeded earnest Dylan McDermott on “Practice” before embracing the comic quirkiness of “Legal” and his larger-than-life tango partner, William Shatner. Their patio tete-a-tetes offered the ultimate in verbal jousting.\n\n‘Frasier’ (NBC)\n\n“Frasier” wouldn’t have succeeded had it tried to outdo “Cheers,” one of the greatest workplace comedies of all time. The spinoff took stuffy psychologist Frasier Crane (the brilliant Kelsey Grammer), a lesser character whose pomposity and anxiety offered great comic possibility, and moved him from a Boston bar to a Seattle apartment (and radio station, but it thrived at home). With the additions of David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, John Mahoney and Peri Gilpin, “Frasier” became TV’s best comedy of manners, cranking out 263 episodes (a record for studio-audience comedies recently surpassed by “The Big Bang Theory”), many of which would have been the toast of Broadway.\n\n'Better Call Saul' (AMC)\n\nSpinning off a critical and popular series makes sense, but carries risk: You’ll always be compared to the original. But “Breaking Bad” progeny “Better Call Saul” has been an unqualified success. Like “Frasier,” it focuses on a minor character, Bob Odenkirk’s delightfully shady lawyer Jimmy McGill (later Saul Goodman), but it takes the opposite tack, going backward to retrofit an origin story that eventually ends with Saul's introduction to the world of “Bad’s” Walter White. So far, so good, and with \"Bad\" alum Jonathan Banks and Rhea Seehorn delivering stellar performances, we’re belted in for seedy Saul’s trip to the bottom.\n\n'Lou Grant' (CBS)\n\nIn his comedic form, irascible Minneapolis TV news director Lou Grant (Edward Asner) physically threw inane anchorman Ted Baxter out of the station on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” In his dramatic form, he became a serious newspaper editor at Los Angeles’s Tribune, managing a staff of muckrakers when journalism was enjoying its post-Watergate glow. “Lou Grant” pulled off the ultimate switcheroo as an hour-long drama spun from a sitcom. Gruff, beloved Lou thrived in both environs, earning Asner Emmys in comedy and drama categories.\n\nGoodnight, Mr. Grant: Ed Asner, seven-time Emmy winner, TV's beloved Lou Grant and star of 'Up,' dies at 91\n\nThe worst\n\n'Joey' (NBC)\n\nPoor Matt Le Blanc. He gets an A for effort, but \"Joey\" was doomed from the start, an ill-advised spinoff of one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. Part of what made \"Friends\" work was that it was a well-balanced show that (most of the time) didn't let its over-the-top personalities overpower one another. With Joey Tribbiani at the center, the action moved from New York to L.A. and an annoying cast of characters was thrown in, leaving nothing about \"Joey\" that remotely approached the brilliance of \"Friends.\" Just pretend his story ended with the deconstruction of the foosball table in the \"Friends\" finale.\n\n'Time of Your Life' (Fox)\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt was the most famous cast member on \"Party of Five,\" but she was also the most boring, making her a poor candidate to hold down her own spinoff. \"Time of Your Life\" was a dull drag from the very beginning. Removing the family dynamic by sending Sarah (Hewitt) to New York, and giving her a generic bunch of young-adult friends (played by Jennifer Garner and Pauley Perrette), only made things worse.\n\n'Caprica' (Syfy)\n\n\"Caprica\" was everything the beautiful, politically clever and haunting \"Battlestar Galactica\" wasn't: Trite, boring and phony. A prequel that showed the universe of the series before the nuclear apocalypse that kicked off \"Galactica\" was full of potential. Yet the final product lacked the innovation that made its parent series great.\n\n‘Joanie Loves Chachi’ (ABC)\n\nThe problem here? Too little and too late. The 1982 not-so-“Happy Days” spinoff featured two of the least-interesting characters, Richie’s little sister, Joanie (Erin Moran) and Fonzie Lite Chachi Arcola (Scott Baio). It premiered a full five years after the “Happy Days” episode that originated the phrase “jumping the shark,” proving the original was out of ideas long before this spinoff got rolling, never a good sign. And let’s face it: Chachi’s “Wah-wah-wah” can’t hold a candle to Fonzie’s “Aaaaaay!”\n\n‘AfterMASH’ (CBS)\n\nColonel Potter (Harry Morgan), Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) and Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) were beloved supporting characters on one of TV’s greatest comedies, “M*A*S*H,” but a stateside VA hospital paled next to the Korean War as a sitcom setting. Without Hawkeye, B.J. or Margaret Houlihan, the trio couldn’t support the comedy by themselves. And after 200 or so episodes of “M*A*S*H,” there may not have been much left of interest to reveal, either. The title itself suggests more a schedule placeholder than an actual series, which may have been the problem.The smarter move would have been not to re-enlist.\n\nIf you love television and love talking about it even more, USA TODAY Life’s Yes, I’m Still Watching is here for you.

Mix in the huge number of original series and films Netflix debuts each weekend, and there's a ton of programming to sort through if you're just looking for something new to offer distraction and calm amid a crazy world.\n\nWe have curated the best of the TV shows Netflix has available to stream as of August 2022 (in alphabetical order), from its smart new originals to absolute TV classics.\n\n1. “Alias Grace”\n\nStarring Sarah Gadon and Anna Paquin, this dizzyingly beautiful adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s novel about a historical murderess is haunting in its storytelling. The miniseries far outpaces, in both style and substance, the more famous Atwood adaptation on Hulu.\n\n2. “American Crime Story”\n\nBetween “The People v. O.J. Simpson” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace,” Ryan Murphy’s true-crime anthology has delivered narratives that lack the seedy exploitation so often associated with the genre. Instead, each season is a historical reckoning with huge cultural moments, portrayed with impeccable acting and writing.2.\n\n3. “American Vandal”\n\nA hilarious mockumentary poking at true-crime documentaries like Netflix’s own “Making a Murderer,” this series treats teen problems with the gravitas of a murder investigation. And considering most emotions and dramas feel like life or death in adolescence, “Vandal” is deeply moving in how it brings high school to life.\n\n4. “Avatar: The Last Airbender” and \"The Legend of Korra\"\n\nA Nickelodeon animated series with a devoted adult following, “Airbender” is a fantasy epic in kid's clothing with drama to rival “Game of Thrones.” The gorgeously drawn series takes place in a world torn apart by war and genocide, where a pint-size chosen one might be able to save lives, if he can train hard enough and face his greatest fears. A follow-up series set a generation in the future and aimed at an older audience, \"Korra,\" surpasses its source material in maturity and storytelling complexity, becoming a modern classic.\n\n5. \"The Baby-Sitters Club\"\n\nNetflix's heartwarming and sweet family series, based on the novels by Ann M. Martin, was canceled too soon after just two seasons. The series, about a group of middle school girls who form a babysitting business, is full of life lessons, great acting and humor for all ages. \"Baby-Sitters\" was one of the best shows on TV.\n\n6. “Better Call Saul”\n\nA rare spin-off to nearly outpace its source material in quality and complexity, Bob Odenkirk’s “Breaking Bad” prequel continues to reach new heights in every season and has long since stepped out of its parent show’s shadow.\n\n7. \"Big Mouth\"\n\nNick Kroll's animated celebration of preteen debauchery is one of the most reliably funny series on TV (and definitely the most cringeworthy). The animated middle schoolers navigate first periods, crushes and every other pubescent nightmare, along with actual Hormone Monsters (and a monstress) causing problems along the way. No series will make you happier that you've already lived through adolescence.\n\n8. “Blown Away”\n\nNetflix’s little reality series about competitive glass blowing is mesmerizing to watch, as its highly talented contestants stretch molten materials into stunning works of art. Breezy, funny and surprising, it’s a supremely satisfying series to binge-watch. Season 3 of the dazzling competition arrives July 22.\n\n9. “BoJack Horseman”\n\nA misanthropic Hollywood horse (Will Arnett) leads this animated satire series that is deeper, more clever and more thought-provoking than most live-action series even aspire to be.\n\n10. \"Breaking Bad\"\n\nBryan Cranston and Aaron Paul give unforgettable performances in this AMC series that ranks on the list of the greatest TV shows of all time. The tragedy of high school science teacher Walter White (Cranston) who turned into a meth-dealing kingpin over the series' run is epic and heartbreaking. It's an anti-hero story infinitely copied in other series but never better than it is here.\n\n11. \"Bridgerton\"\n\nA bodice ripper taken seriously by its writers and stars, \"Bridgerton\" is a marvelous first entry in power producer Shonda Rhimes' Netflix deal. The series follows a group of pretty upper-class Brits navigating the marriage market in Regency-era England. The resplendent series is an expensive, glossy manifesto for the weightiness of the romance genre: a story that deals with love, class, race and a host of other topics while expertly landing every choreographed ballroom dance. Season 2, which focuses on eldest son Anthony, lived up to the hype of the first.\n\n12. “Call the Midwife”\n\nThis British period drama, set among nurse midwives serving poor families in 1950s London, is like an epidural injecting joy, tears and adorable babies into your life. Although it gets a little repetitive in later seasons, its raw emotion and British sensibility make it a must-watch for the “Downton Abbey” crowd.\n\nMore:The 40 best TV shows to watch on Paramount+ right now, from 'The Good Fight' to 'The Real World'\n\n13. \"Cobra Kai\"\n\nThe fantastic revival of \"The Karate Kid\" franchise, featuring Ralph Macchio and William Zabka in their original roles, is one of the smartest ways to bring a kids' story into adulthood. It picks up three decades after the All Valley Karate Tournament, with Zabka's Johnny Lawrence a gentler hero and Macchio's Daniel LaRusso playing the villain.\n\n14. “Community”\n\nWacky, weird and often wonderful, NBC’s comedy about a diverse group of friends at a community college defies genre and label in its first few excellent seasons to create engrossing television. The later seasons are fine but never as good as the first three.\n\n15. “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\"\n\nA magnificent mélange of musical might, the four-season CW series ambitiously put original song and dance on network TV week after week. Anchored by creator/star Rachel Bloom as struggling heroine Rebecca Bunch, “Crazy Ex” mixed earworms with one of the best depictions of a mental health journey ever on TV.\n\n16. “The Crown”\n\nFor devoted anglophiles and royal rejecters alike, Netflix’s dramatization of the reign of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II makes a juicy soap out of the royal family, in a prestigious, Emmy-winning package. Season 4 introduces Princess Diana (Emma Corrin), Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) and a lot more drama to the Windsors.\n\n17. \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\"\n\nThis under-the-radar CW series aired what turned out to be its final season this year. Over the years, the show featured intricately developed characters who fit into the show’s unique tone: super fun, bouncy yet sophisticated science fiction with plenty of romance and comedy thrown in. It’s hard to say a series that ran for seven seasons was canceled too soon, but “Legends” was so superb at reinventing itself that it could have run for many more years.\n\n18. \"Deaf U\"\n\nThis smart, addictive reality series follows college kids at Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf and hard of hearing. In addition to illuminating the deaf and hard of hearing community, the show is incredible at creating relationship drama and comedy out of the lives of the students it follows, and it has the rare reality ensemble that pops off the screen with charm.\n\n19. “Dear White People”\n\nStronger and more self-assured than the movie on which it’s based, this series, about Black students at an elite university full of microaggressions and outright racism, is whip-smart and often hilarious.\n\n20. “Derry Girls”\n\nYou may have to watch with subtitles to parse the strong Irish accents, but this series about Catholic teen girls in Northern Ireland during the 1990s portion of the “Troubles,” the violent religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, is one of the funniest shows on TV, even for Americans unfamiliar with the history.\n\n21. \"Elite\"\n\nOne of the many stellar foreign-language offerings on Netflix, \"Elite\" is a captivating and thrilling teen drama from Spain. Set in a prestigious high school, the series follows three students enrolled on scholarships and some of their wealthy classmates. While it owes something to \"Gossip Girl,\" \"Big Little Lies\" and \"The O.C.,\" the series never feels derivative or tired. The chemistry of the cast and mystery elements make \"Elite\" an easy and addictive binge-watch. Season 5 arrives April 8.best tv\n\n22. \"Evil\"\n\n\"The Good Wife\" and \"The Good Fight\" creators Robert and Michelle King bring their cutting dialogue and timely stories to this superb CBS series. \"Evil\" follows a psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a tech specialist (Aasif Mandvi) as they investigate alleged demon possessions, miracles and other phenomenon. How much evil is really out there? Season 2 is available on Paramount+.\n\n23. “Friday Night Lights”\n\nThe drama on NBC's acclaimed high school football series undeniably makes it one of the best shows to binge-watch, equally entertaining for teens and adults. They don’t make high school dramas like this anymore. (The drama is available on Peacock and Hulu as well.)\n\n24. \"Girlfriends\"\n\nTracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, Persia White and Jill Marie Jones anchored this hilarious and affecting 2000-2008 UPN sitcom about the love lives and friendships of four Black women in Los Angeles.\n\n25. “The Good Place”\n\nNBC's afterlife sitcom feels like a dose of palliative care with its bright colors, puns and visual gags. Underneath its appealing aesthetics, \"Place\" has great performances, great writing and some sincere thoughts about ethics and philosophy.\n\n26. “Grace and Frankie”\n\nJane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are a magnetic duo in this sitcom from the “Friends” creators. The actresses play the eponymous retirees who learn their husbands are leaving them (for each other). The sometimes raunchy series proves it’s never too late to start over. The seventh and final season premieres on April 29.\n\n27. “The Great British Baking Show”\n\nWarm, friendly, full of soggy bottoms, underproofed loaves and decent people doing their best, this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made.\n\n28. “Grey’s Anatomy”\n\nShonda Rhimes' seminal hospital drama is still on the air after so many seasons for a reason. Sure, the series crossed over from soapy to full-on soap opera early in its tenure, but amid its constant barrage of tragedy and medical grotesquery are compelling relationship dramas that are emotionally honest.\n\n29. “Halt and Catch Fire”\n\nThis short but impactful drama started as a “Mad Men” knockoff about the 1980s computer industry, but greatly improved on a so-so first season. “Halt” evolved into a complex story about communication, connection and women's struggles to achieve power at home and work.\n\n30. \"Heartstopper\"\n\nElation is the best way to describe how you’ll feel after watching Netflix’s young-adult rom-com about two teen British boys who fall head over heels for each other. Based on the graphic novels by Alice Oseman (and adapted by the author), “Heartstopper” brilliantly portrays the struggles of being a queer teenager, opting not for despair but for jubilant hope. It uses animated imagery from the comics that adds to the feeling that “Heartstopper” is part reality, part fantasy. Its positive take on the story of coming out and falling in love feels essential.\n\n31. “Jane the Virgin”\n\nThe telenovela-style story of a virgin who's artificially inseminated by accident started strong and rode high for five excellent seasons. Although the moving series isn't a laugh-out-loud sitcom, its moments of joy and levity are plentiful.\n\n32. Ken Burns documentaries\n\nThis one is a cheat, because there are just so many great documentaries from the legendary filmmaker. But if you want to be educated, entertained and potentially shocked all at once, try some of the great ones available on Netflix: “Prohibition,” “The Civil War,” “The West” and “The Roosevelts: An Intimate History.”\n\n33. “Lovesick”\n\nIf you like a sweet (but not too saccharine) romantic comedy, this short British series is a good choice. The story starts with a man diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease reaching out to his former flames and morphs into a touching and surprising will they/won’t they love story.\n\n34. “The Magicians”\n\nLike an R-rated mashup of “Game of Thrones,” \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Chronicles of Narnia,\" the superb fantasy series follows a group of adult magicians who discover a fictional world from popular children's books is real – and deathly dangerous.\n\n35. “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”\n\nThere are comedy classics, and then there are the genre’s very foundations. If you are a fan of “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” but have never seen the hysterical, groundbreaking sketch TV show from comedians Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin that came first, now is the time to correct that error.\n\n36. “Never Have I Ever”\n\nMindy Kaling's teen sitcom is a breath of honest, awkward fresh air. Loosely based on Kaling's experiences, the series follows Devi (sparkling new talent Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), an Indian American teen fumbling her way through an angry, frustrating adolescence. Season 3 of the acclaimed comedy arrives Aug. 12.\n\n37. “One Day at a Time”\n\nLike Norman Lear's original, which premiered in 1975, this family sitcom reboot, about a Cuban American family in Los Angeles, is expert at combining frank discussion of social issues with hilarity. A shortened fourth season is available on Paramount+, but the first three wonderful years are still streaming on their original home.\n\n38. “Orange Is the New Black”\n\nNetflix’s groundbreaking series had ups and downs over its run, but especially its first three seasons are exquisite character portraits in a space we’ve rarely seen: the inside of a women’s prison.\n\n39. “Pose”\n\nThe LGBTQ drama, set in 1980s ballroom culture, is ambitious, tragic and complex. It’s gorgeously filmed with especially strong performances from Emmy winner Billy Porter as Pray Tell, Mj Rodriguez as Blanca and Indya Moore as Angel.\n\n40. \"The Queen's Gambit\"\n\nThe story of a fictional 1960s chess prodigy (Anya Taylor-Joy, at her absolute best) battling addiction as she rises through the ranks of the chess elite is far more engrossing than it sounds. The miniseries, from the writer of \"Logan,\" manages to make its chess matches as epic as any football game and features a superb cast.\n\n41. “Queer Eye”\n\nInspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles: All those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can in a week.\n\n42. “Schitt’s Creek”\n\nFull of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains love and a little perspective is always a mood-booster.\n\n43. “Sense8”\n\nSometimes logically lacking nonsensical but never emotionally insincere, the Wachowski siblings’ sprawling sci-fi series is a celebration of LGBTQ+ pride and love in many forms.\n\n44. \"Seinfeld\"\n\nIf you've never seen Jerry Seinfeld's landmark NBC sitcom (previously streaming on Hulu), now is a good time to start. Famously a show about \"nothing,\" \"Seinfeld\" is one of the comedies that (mostly) stands the test of time, from its hilarious and talented cast (also including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards), to its enduring jokes and even its own created holiday (a Festivus for \"the rest of us\").\n\n45. “Stranger Things”\n\nThe nostalgic and paranormal series became one of Netflix’s first real sensations, and it almost lives up to all that hype. With fantastic kid actors, terrifying horror homages and all the 1980s pop culture references you can handle, the seasons of “Stranger” are compelling and alluring. Season 4 is now streaming in its entirety, and there is just one season left to tell the full story of the Upside Down.\n\n46. “Unbelievable”\n\nBased on a Pulitzer Prize-winning ProPublica article, \"Unbelievable\" is both infuriating and triumphant, highlighting the deep flaws in our criminal justice system while also celebrating justice eventually done. With a stellar cast, “Unbelievable” tells the story of a rape victim (Kaitlyn Dever) who isn’t believed by police and the two detectives (Toni Collette and Merritt Wever) who bring her attacker to justice years later – after he raped several more women.\n\n47. “Unorthodox”\n\nThis slightly under-the-radar miniseries is based on the true story of a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in New York and runs away to Germany. Often using Yiddish dialogue and authentic costuming, the series is an immersive, addictive journey.\n\n48. “The Witcher”\n\nThere are TV series that are so bad they’re good, and then there’s “The Witcher,” a bacchanalia of B-movie tropes, nonsensical plots, unnecessary nudity and terrible dialogue that finds the sweet spot of being silly and sensational at once. The writers and actors, including star Henry Cavill, take this fantasy thriller both too seriously and not seriously at all, making it one of the most surprisingly delightful series on Netflix.\n\n49. “When They See Us”\n\nAva DuVernay’s striking miniseries gives voice to the so-called Central Park Five, a group of five Black and Latino boys wrongly convicted of assault in the 1980s. With a talented group of rising stars as the falsely accused adolescents – Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Emmy-winner Jharrel Jerome and Marquis Rodriguez – “Us” brings history to the screen as a brutal, unrelenting tragedy.\n\n50. “You”\n\nThe soapy stalker thriller starring Penn Badgley was a pleasant surprise in its original home on Lifetime and became a sensation once it moved to Netflix. Of all the current series that traffic in bad men doing bad things, “You” remains one of the few that asks interesting questions about its bad guy.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra\n\nHave a different streaming service?

(AP) — The American Athletic Conference and ESPN have reached agreement on a new 12-year television contract that will increase revenue to the league's schools but is far less than the money provided to their Power Five counterparts.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the negotiations says the conference will receive about $1 billion over the next dozen years and in exchange ESPN will get the rights to AAC games, many of which will be broadcast on ESPN-plus, the company's a la carte digital platform.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been signed, said the deal will provide the conference with about $83.3 million per year, with each member school receiving an average of just under $7 million a year.\n\nThe agreement, first reported by Sports Business Journal Daily, runs from the 2020-21 academic year through 2031-32.\n\nThe deal will more than triple the per school payouts the AAC will provide its members for media rights under its current contract, but falls well short of providing a cash infusion that would support the league's narrative of being \"Power Six\" school.\n\nThe most recent deal the Big Ten signed with Fox and ESPN will pay the conference $2.64 billion over six years. Among the Power Five, the Atlantic Coast Conference had the smallest revenue distribution payouts to its members last year at an average of $26.6 million. That number is likely to go up with the launch of ESPN's ACC Network in August.\n\nBut the American's deal is better than other major college football conferences in the so-called Group of Five.\n\nThe Mountain West, which is nearing the end of its deal with ESPN, pays its members about $1 million per season from media rights deal. The Mid-American Conference is in the middle of 13-year deal with ESPN that pays the conference about $10 million per year to split between its 12 members. Conference USA and the Sun Belt have TV deals that pay about $500,000 annually.\n\nThe American's deal will result in some football games being broadcast on ABC. Other football and basketball games will appear on ESPN's cable television networks, including ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU.\n\nBut most basketball and other AAC sports will be provided only to those who subscribe to ESPN-plus, a separate digital platform that costs just under $5 a month.\n\nThe deal will allow for the broadcast up about 1,000 AAC events per year on ESPN-plus by its third year, the official said.\n\nCBS retains the rights to a small number of basketball games and Navy some football games.\n\nThe ESPN contract also includes language that would protect the network, should marquee schools, such as UCF, Cincinnati or UConn leave for another conference.\n\n__\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2014/01/30/super-bowl-nfl-revenue-denver-broncos-seattle-seahawks/5061197/", "title": "NFL takes aim at $25 billion, but at what price?", "text": "Brent Schrotenboer\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says NFL wants to grow from %2410 billlion to %2425 billion by 2027\n\nLeague revenue comes from four major sources%3A media rights%2C sponsors%2C attendance and merchandising\n\nOne risk for the NFL is whether its financial goals might price regular fans out of games\n\nNEW YORK (Jan. 31) — Sunday's Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., might be the most popular and expensive television program in U.S. history – about 110 million viewers watching a football game that commands nearly $4 million for a 30-second commercial.\n\nTickets at the 50-yard line cost about $10,000. A 20-ounce cup of Bud Light will cost $14.\n\n\"Nothing is really sacred anymore,\" said John Vrooman, a sports economics professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nIt won't stop there. The National Football League hopes to achieve $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027, up from about $10 billion now. Several analysts told USA TODAY Sports that the NFL can get there, but it will be an expensive journey. More palatial stadiums. Expanded playoffs. More exposure in more places, including smartphones, games in London and more Thursday night games sold to the highest-bidding network.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell gave the magic number at a meeting of NFL team owners in 2010: a goal of tripling league revenue in 17 years. If it happens, the NFL would have more income than the gross domestic products of dozens of small countries and would be in the same financial district currently occupied by gigantic global brands such as McDonald's, Nike and Goodyear Tire, each of which recently took in about $21 to $28 billion annually.\n\nWho will pay the price? Fans, sponsors and broadcasters. The NFL remains the most popular sports league in America, and it commands a premium. If the average NFL fan thinks the cost of attending games is already too high, how about paying ever-higher prices to watch games on ESPN and the NFL Network? Cable and satellite TV providers pay ESPN an average of $6.04 per subscription per month, more than double from 10 years ago and dwarfing the likes of CNN (63 cents) and TBS (72 cents), according to SNL Kagan, a market research firm.\n\n\"The standard (cable television) package that households receive is skyrocketing in cost at a point in the U.S. economy when we have increasingly lopsided distribution of income,\" sports economist Andrew Zimbalist told USA TODAY Sports. \"Those two things have to collide.\"\n\nThe future\n\nThe NFL declined to release financial data, but an estimate of its revenue can be pieced together through various sources by economists and market researchers. That $10 billion pie is roughly sliced four ways, according to Navigate Research, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in the evaluation of sports and entertainment marketing investments.\n\nAbout $5 billion from media and television rights to broadcast games.\n\nAbout $1-2 billion in sponsorships, such as its long-running deal with PepsiCo, worth about $90 million to $100 million per year.\n\nAbout $2 billion related to attendance and ticket sales.\n\nAbout $1 billion in merchandise and licensing.\n\nGrowing to $25 billion annually will require compound annual growth of about 7 percent, around $1 billion per year.\n\nCBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN provide the NFL with a total of about $5 billion to $6 billion annually from contracts that run through 2021-22. By 2027, Navigate Research predicts such media rights revenues could reach $17 billion.\n\nThat ambitious projection assumes that live NFL games will continue to be a golden goose for networks and their advertisers for one major reason: NFL games are one of the few remaining programs that huge audiences want to watch live instead of recording to watch later – fast-forwarding through the commercials that companies pay millions to air.\n\n\"We are firm believers that there is nothing more valuable in the world of TV than the NFL – nothing,\" said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson, a stock research firm that specializes in the media and telecommunications industries. \"Their ability to get to $25 billion is kind of predicated on the staying power of the product. I think they're going to ask for whatever they need to from their broadcast partners, their cable partners.\"\n\nVrooman, the Vanderbilt economist, says the NFL can get there primarily because it's a monopoly – the richest sports league on the planet with a business plan built largely through the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which allows sports leagues to pool their television rights for sale to the highest bidder, protecting them from antitrust laws.\n\n\"The monopoly rule is to gouge half as many fans more than twice as much on everything,\" he said. He also predicts the league will become \"increasingly more exclusive with the same general formula of fewer fans having access at higher prices to generate more certain media, venue and gate revenues.\"\n\nThe NFL disputes that, noting its commitment to broadcast some games on free over-the-air TV networks, which helps it reach bigger audiences. Even games on ESPN, for example, are available on free TV in local markets. But the league is not shy about its appetite for growth.\n\n\"We measure our business very simply: Is consumption going up, and is the economic pie growing?\" said Brian Rolapp, the chief operating officer of NFL media.\n\nRolapp was involved in recent NFL deals with Verizon, Twitter, Microsoft and the television networks. He currently is involved in shopping a Thursday Night Football TV package and working on a new deal with DirecTV. He called the $25 billion goal an aspiration.\n\n\"In order to get to a number that lofty, it requires a lot of different things,\" Rolapp told USA TODAY Sports. \"It requires, clearly, hard work. It requires different thinking. We are relatively strong in our business. We're strong as a league, but what we always say around here is complacency is our enemy.\"\n\nThe formula\n\nFor better or worse, the road to $25 billion probably requires some variation of the following, analysts told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nMore new and upgraded stadiums. This year's Super Bowl is in chilly New Jersey, a reward for the Jets and Giants building the swanky MetLife Stadium, which opened in 2010. Yet it has been 11 years since the Super Bowl was in 70-degree San Diego, where the Chargers still play in outdated Qualcomm Stadium.\n\nTo keep revenue growing, the NFL needs stadiums that are big moneymakers, such as AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, where suites cost up to $500,000 per year and fans pay more than $80 for seats in the upper deck end zone. Levi's Stadium, the new $1.3 billion home of the San Francisco 49ers, opens later this year and will host the Super Bowl in 2016. Later that year, the Minnesota Vikings will open their new stadium.\n\nThe risk for the NFL is that it might price out everyday, jersey-wearing fans, who might decide they'd rather watch games on high-definition TV anyway. Attendance accounts for only about about 25 percent of NFL revenue, and at times there have been signs of sagging demand. Three of the NFL's four first-round playoff games this year struggled to sell out. Will fans keep going to games if the price keeps rising and the view is better on TV?\n\n\"That is a big concern,\" Rolapp said. \"It will always be an important part of the revenue …We still believe it's still the best place to experience NFL football. I think it will be for some time, but we have to keep innovating so it remains that.\"\n\nMore weeknight games, anyone? The NFL has been shopping a Thursday night package to TV networks and could announce a buyer soon with possible simulcasting on the NFL Network, the league's cable outlet. NFL games once were mass-delivered for television consumption on Sunday afternoons and Monday night.\n\nNBC, for example, pays about $1 billion per year for its package of Sunday night games and playoff games.\n\nMore televised content. If there's demand, create more supply. That's why the league is considering expanding the playoffs, creating another product to sell to networks eager to capture big live audiences. The NFL also is turning the offseason into a moneymaker by televising the NFL Combine in February and the NFL Draft in the spring, which has expanded from one day to three days, including two nights in prime time.\n\nNew markets. The NFL has been priming London as a market, with two sold-out games there last year and three games on tap in 2013. Meanwhile, Los Angeles hasn't had an NFL team since 1994. Moving existing teams from weak markets into bigger vacant markets might give team owners a better way to increase their shared revenue as opposed to adding more franchises to the 32-team league.\n\nConversely, Los Angeles has value to the NFL as a bargaining chip – the unstated threat of moving into that big, empty market can help existing franchises wring out taxpayer dollars for stadium upgrades and new construction.\n\nGet ready for NFL teams to make \"renewed threats of franchise relocation to leverage public money for private stadiums in the second venue revolution, just like the first (round of stadium upgrades) over the last two decades,\" Vrooman said. \"Monopoly power over TV rights and franchise location is what provides the real engine for the economic growth of the most powerful sports league in the world.\"\n\nPhones, Internet and new media. More consumers get their news and information from their smartphones –a trend the NFL recognized with its recent $250 million annual deal with Verizon to stream games onto phone screens. The NFL also recently made deals with Twitter and Microsoft's Xbox, giving it new revenue streams in growing interactive and social media.\n\nWith more viewers consuming video content online instead of on cable, cable companies and cable channels could see subscription revenue plummet. Those channels – including ESPN and the NFL Network – can try to recoup that revenue through online content, but it might not be as lucrative.\n\n\"The established content suppliers – NFL, ESPN – are uneasy and so going very slowly,\" said Roger Noll, emeritus economics professor at Stanford. \"They see the potential for a huge payoff, but also for a huge bursting of the bubble, and want to keep control until they know where things are likely to go.\"\n\nTelevision. The NFL's TV rights contracts soon will be worth about $7 billion per year combined, with most of them starting this year and lasting through 2022. What happens in 2023?\n\n\"It's a new day after that,\" Rolapp said. \"We'll just have to see. A lot of things we do digitally along the way are a great experiment for us to see what the world will look like. We will be prepared one way or the other to be able to shift to where the consumer is.\"\n\nTo get to $25 billion, the NFL probably needs about $15-17 billion from networks.\n\nIf networks pay it, those costs likely will be passed down to the consumer. ESPN likely would ask for higher rates from advertisers and higher subscriber fees from cable distributors, and even viewers who don't like football would pay more because cable channels are not offered a la carte.\n\n\"Everything else 10 years from now will be worth less relative to what the NFL is going to be worth,\" said Nathanson, the stock analyst. \"No other sport has that kind of national draw to it.\"\n\nAs long as the NFL can bring big live audiences, it'll be hard for the likes of ESPN to avoid paying up, but the growing risk is viewers who could decide to cancel their cable subscriptions and use other devices to watch what they want.\n\nThe NFL said it is committed to staying on free television, not just cable, where it has its own network and can reap cable subscription revenue in addition to advertising revenue.\n\n\"It would have been very easy years ago to migrate our games to cable,\" Rolapp said. \"In fact, we could have gotten more money in the short term, it could be argued, if we would have done that. But we really are committed to a reach model and free television.\"\n\nStaying power\n\nMuch of this, of course, assumes that the NFL can continue to bring those live audiences well into the next decade.\n\nAnother risk to the league's long-term popularity is the concussion crisis. Amid lawsuits from former players, the league has vowed to make the game safer. This could mean changes in equipment and more rules that restrict bone-jarring hits.\n\n\"To the extent the NFL tries to pass new rules to reduce the force of hitting or the kind of hits you can make, I think it hurts the game,\" Zimbalist said. \"And there signs that parents no longer want their children playing this game. I don't mean to predict doom for the NFL. I don't think there is doom, but the notion that they're going to get to $25 billion seems to be excessively optimistic. I would not bet on that figure.\"\n\nRolapp, the Harvard-educated NFL executive, says the league maintains a \"healthy paranoia\" about all perceived risks, including pushing too much product onto fans. In the meantime, the NFL plans to stick to a simple formula.\n\n\"We're really in the business of aggregating America around events and around our game,\" Rolapp said. \"There are fewer and fewer places that can do that. If you can aggregate audiences, you are going to be more and more valuable.\"\n\nFollow Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.

How is Rutgers faring in its 2018 recruiting?\n\nAfter a slow start, the Scarlet Knights have picked up commitments from several three-star recruits. But they’ve lost too many recruits, especially to Boston College and Penn State. They have a lot of work to do.\n\n2. How lucrative is the new Big Ten television contract?\n\nThe six-year media rights deal is worth $2.58 billion, with ESPN and Fox to air its football games. Their deal with the Big Ten Network (which the conference owns 49 percent) was extended until 2032.\n\nOFFENSE:North Jersey's all-time best college football players\n\nDEFENSE:North Jersey's all-time best college football players\n\n3. How does Rutgers coach Chris Ash’s contract compare with other Big Ten coaches?\n\nOnly Indiana’s new coach Tom Allen makes less than Ash, who Rutgers will pay $2.1 million in his second season. Allen’s contract ($1.795M) pales in comparison to the $9 million Michigan reportedly is paying Jim Harbaugh in 2017.\n\n4. What Rutgers’ connection helped Tennessee recruit Jarrett Guarantano?\n\nCurrent Vols coach Butch Jones was a graduate assistant at Rutgers from 1980-82 when Guarantano’s father Jim was a star wide receiver. His son, a redshirt freshman from Bergen Catholic, will start the season as Tennessee's backup quarterback.\n\n5. What’s to become of former Rutgers quarterback Michael Dare?\n\nAfter not playing a down in two years at RU, the former Elmwood Park star is attending Lackawanna (Pa.), a junior college power. Dare would have two years of eligibility if he transferred to a Division 1 program.\n\nRUTGERS' HOT SEAT:5 players, coaches to watch as 2017 season begins\n\n6. Which sons of former Giants players are being heavily recruited?\n\nHoward Cross III, son of Howard Jr., is a 235-pound junior defensive lineman at St. Joseph, and R.J. Oben, son of Roman, is a 230-pound junior defensive end at St. Peter’s Prep. Rutgers has made offers to both players.\n\n7. How intense was the football recruiting of Yankees slugger Aaron Judge?\n\nHigh-profile programs such as Notre Dame, UCLA and Michigan were interested before Judge decided on baseball at Fresno State. Most programs wanted him as a tight end, but a few thought Judge, who weighed 240 pounds then, could be a wide receiver.\n\n8. What’s the college football connection to Yankees hitting coach Alan Cockrell?\n\nCockrell was the first true freshman to start at quarterback for Tennessee and was a two-year starter before suffering a career-ending knee injury. As an outfielder, Cockrell was named to Tennessee’s All-Century baseball team.\n\n9. How important has Chris Partridge been to Michigan’s recruiting efforts?\n\nVery important. The former Paramus Catholic head coach recruited many of the 21 four-star players in the incoming class, which is ranked as the fifth best in the country. Partridge was named recruiter of the year by 247Sports.\n\n10. Which parts of the country are hot beds of recruiting by Army?\n\nTwenty of the incoming freshmen are from Georgia and Texas. John Trainer, a senior running back from Harrington Park, and Juwan Griffith-James, a junior defensive lineman from Bergenfield, are two of three Knights from New Jersey.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2016/03/09/free-agency-beware-brock-osweiler-malik-jackson/81560338/", "title": "Bell: Making a big free agent splash doesn't mean waves of future ...", "text": "Jarrett Bell\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nSplash Day in the NFL should come with a warning label.\n\nBeware: The millions of dollars committed to free agents don’t guarantee mega-success. That now applies to Brock Osweiler, Malik Jackson, Olivier Vernon and a smattering of other players who cashed in with big deals Wednesday.\n\nThe numbers are staggering. With the NFL’s salary cap rising to a record $155.7 million for 2016, there was nearly $1 billion in available cap room, league-wide, as the league's new year commenced.\n\nIt translated to Osweiler bolting from the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos to the Houston Texans, lured by a four-year, $72 million deal. Jackson left Denver, too, with his move to the Jacksonville Jaguars fueled by a six-year, $90 million deal. Vernon landed with the New York Giants, leaving the Miami Dolphins with a five-year deal reportedly worth $85 million — a higher average annual salary than J.J. Watt earns.\n\nBrock Osweiler's departure forces Broncos to turn to Plan B for a QB\n\nYou can’t blame the players, who sacrifice their bodies to play such violent, physically demanding sport, for striking when they're are hot. If the market bears it, take it.\n\nYet there’s always a certain craziness attached to the start of free agency, and this time is no exception.\n\nOsweiler, Jackson and Vernon — they garnered the three most lucrative free agent deals on Wednesday — have something else in common beyond their big paydays: None of them have ever been named to the Pro Bowl. Here’s to market value, potential — and timing.\n\nIt’s kind of like Jackson tweeted Tuesday, as word spread his impending deal: “What a great time to be alive.”\n\nFor sure.\n\nThe Jags were operating with more than $80 million in cap room. Jackson’s deal puts him among the NFL’s top-five highest-paid defenders. Talk about the right place at the right time. He’s clearly a player on the rise.\n\nNFL free agent tracker: What we know now\n\nFrom his 3-4 defensive end position, Jackson was a key member of the top-ranked defense that carried the Broncos to a Super Bowl crown. He was also surrounded by a deep cast of talent, including Super Bowl MVP Von Miller and the other edge rusher, DeMarcus Ware. And the deep D-line rotation was backed up by arguably the NFL’s best secondary.\n\nJackson leaves for a rebuilding unit that ranked 31st last season and gave up the most points in the AFC, which sounds a lot like being surrounded by lesser talent. Will he live up to the big contract?\n\nThe same can be asked of Osweiler, who certainly contributed to the Broncos’ championship drive while filling in admirably when Peyton Manning was recovering from a foot injury. But Osweiler’s deal, averaging $18 million per year, comes for a player with all of seven NFL starts.\n\nLook at the bright side. Texans coach Bill O’Brien, who also got former Dolphins running back Lamar Miller for his backfield, can continue to groom a quarterback who learned from Manning. The price tag, meanwhile, is part of doing business.\n\nJust last week, Washington kept quarterback Kirk Cousins off the market with a franchise tag paying $19.95 million for this season. Now players like Cousins and Osweiler must prove their worth over the long haul. That’s the pressure that comes with the big deals.\n\nTexans follow Broncos' Super Bowl plan by grabbing Brock Osweiler\n\nAnd it's not just the players who will be scrutinized. The decision-makers who make the deals are under the gun, too. In Houston’s case, other attempts by O’Brien and general manager Rick Smith to solidify the quarterback position — Ryan Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mallett, Brian Hoyer — have backfired with a vengeance.\n\nMeanwhile, Vernon wasn’t the only big-money player that GM Jerry Reese added to a Giants defense in extreme makeover mode. New York also signed former Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins to a five-year, $62 million deal (he too, without a Pro Bowl nod), and former New York Jets nose tackle Damon “Snacks” Harrison to a five-year, $46 million contract. The Giants kept defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, still mending his surgically repaired hand, in the fold with a one-year deal that could pay out more than $10 million.\n\nYes, the Giants made more than a ripple on Splash Day, which can do so much for offseason momentum. Will it work?\n\nWe’ve seen it before — and so many warning signs.\n\nThe Dolphins, who made the biggest headlines in free agency last year, have invested more guaranteed dollars than any team since the existing labor deal was struck in 2011. Too bad all that money didn’t buy a single playoff win.\n\nLatest on QBs: Broncos interested in Kaepernick\n\nAnd how many “offseason championships” did Dan Snyder win in Washington?\n\nJust last year, the Philadelphia Eagles made waves with $60 million cornerback Byron Maxwell and $40 million running back DeMarco Murray. And Chip Kelly traded for linebacker Kiko Alonso. Now, with Kelly first to go, they’re all gone.\n\nBut it was a nice splash. While it lasted.\n\n***\n\nFollow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell\n\nPHOTOS: Notable NFL players on the move", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/13/donald-trump-george-washington-net-worth-us-presidents/39011559/", "title": "From Donald Trump to George Washington: The net worth of US ...", "text": "Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story misstated from whom Martha Washington inherited a substantial amount of property.\n\nWhile the presidency of the United States is a prestigious job, it does not pay as well as one might think.\n\nThe annual presidential salary is $400,000. While this is still within the top 1 percent of American earners, it is very little when compared to the typical compensation given to America’s CEOs and executives.\n\nHowever, many men who have occupied the highest office in the land did not need any salary at all. The presidency has long been a position held by men who had already inherited fortunes or earned them during their lifetimes.\n\nIn America’s early days, only property-owning white men were allowed to vote. Consequently, only the wealthy first participated in American politics, meaning the first presidents were all extremely well off.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nWith time, voting restrictions loosened, campaign finance regulations tightened, and people with more modest backgrounds began to rise to the presidency. Several U.S. presidents were either poor or in debt when they were elected president.\n\nHowever, even as all these things have changed, the fact remains that the majority of presidents are independently wealthy and only a very small number could have been fairly called poor at any point in their lifetimes.\n\nFame and wealth continue to have an outsized impact on public perception. Wealth and the influence that can accompany it have not lost relevancy. President Donald Trump was able to use his personal wealth to fund the majority of his successful political campaign.\n\n24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of every American president, from George Washington to Donald Trump. For the purposes of comparison, we provided net worth figures for each president in current dollars. Because a number of presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, we only provided each president's net worth at their peak.\n\nGeorge Washington\n\n• Term: 1789-1797 (1st president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $587.0 million\n\nHis Virginia plantation, “Mount Vernon,” consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by over 300 slaves. His wife, Martha Washington, inherited a substantial amount of property from her first husband. Washington made significantly more than subsequent presidents: his salary was two percent of the total U.S. budget in 1789.\n\nJohn Adams\n\n• Term: 1797-1801 (2nd president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $21.3 million\n\nAdams received a modest inheritance from his father. His wife, Abigail Adams, was a member of the Quincys, a prestigious Massachusetts family. Adams owned a handsome estate in Quincy, Massachusetts. The estate, known as “Peacefield,” covered approximately 40 acres. He also had a thriving law practice.\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\n• Term: 1801-1809 (3rd president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $236.8 million\n\nJefferson was left 3,000 acres and several dozen slaves by his father. “Monticello,” his home on a 5,000 acre plantation in Virginia, was one of the architectural wonders of its time. He made significant money in various political positions before becoming president, but was left mired in debt towards the end of his life.\n\nJames Madison\n\n• Term: 1809-1817 (4th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $113.3 million\n\nMadison was the largest landowner in Orange County, Virginia, with land holding consisting of 5,000 acres and the “Montpelier” estate. He made significant money as secretary of state and president. Madison lost money at the end of his life due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation.\n\nJames Monroe\n\n• Term: 1817-1825 (5th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $30.4 million\n\nMonroe’s wife, Elizabeth, was the daughter of wealthy British officer. He made significant money during eight years as president, but entered retirement severely in debt and was forced to sell his Highland plantation, which included 3,500 acres.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams\n\n• Term: 1825-1829 (6th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $23.3 million\n\nAdams inherited most of his father’s land. His father, President John Adams, owned a 40 acre estate known as “Peacefield”. His wife was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. He devoted most of his adult life to public service, notably after leaving office.\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\n• Term: 1829-1837 (7th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $132.6 million\n\nWhile he was considered to be in touch with the average middle class American, Jackson quietly became one of the wealthiest presidents of the 1800’s. “Old Hickory” married into wealth and made money in the military. His homestead ”The Hermitage” included 1,050 acres of prime real estate. Over the course of his life, he owned as many as 300 slaves.\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\n• Term: 1837-1841 (8th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $29.3 million\n\nVan Buren made substantial income as an attorney. He was one of only two men to serve as secretary of state, vice president, and president. He owned the 225-acre “Lindenwald” estate in upstate New York.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison\n\n• Term: 1841 (9th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $6.1 million\n\nHarrison married into money – his wife’s father was a prominent judge and landowner. When Harrison’s mother died, he inherited 3,000 acres near Charles City, Virginia, which he later sold to his brother. He also owned “Grouseland” mansion and property, in Vincennes, Indiana. Despite his assets, Harrison died penniless, causing Congress to create a special pension for his widow.\n\nJohn Tyler\n\n• Term: 1841-1845 (10th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $57.7 million\n\nTyler inherited a 1,000-acre tobacco plantation. His first wife, Letitia, was wealthy. Tyler bought “Sherwood Manor,” a 1,600 acre estate, previously owned by William Henry Harrison. He became indebted during the Civil War and died poor.\n\nJames Knox Polk\n\n• Term: 1845-1849 (11th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $11.1 million\n\nLike his wife, Sarah Childress, Polk’s father was a wealthy plantation owner and speculator. Polk made significant sums as speaker of the house and governor of Tennessee, and owned 920 acres in Coffeeville, Mississippi, as well as 25 slaves.\n\nZachary Taylor\n\n• Term: 1849-1850 (12th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $7.1 million\n\nTaylor inherited significant amounts of land from his family, which at one point included property in Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana. He made substantial money in land speculation, the leasing of warehouses, and investments in bank and utility stocks. Taylor owned a sizeable plantation in Mississippi and a home in Baton Rouge.\n\nMillard Fillmore\n\n• Term: 1850-1853 (13th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $4 million\n\nNeither Fillmore nor his wife had significant inheritance. He founded a college that is the current State University of New York at Buffalo, and his primary holding was a house in nearby East Aurora, New York.\n\nFranklin Pierce\n\n• Term: 1853-1857 (14th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $2.0 million\n\nPierce’s father was frontier farmer, and his wife was a well-to-do aristocrat.

Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly signed a $65 million deal for the rights to their memoir, but it is unclear how much of that money they have received, if any. Former presidents often make six figures for paid speeches, and since Obama is known as a great orator, many organizations are likely be lining up for his services. While Obama’s net worth is somewhat unclear, it will certainly continue to climb. American University estimates the Obamas could earn up to $242 million in the coming years.\n\nDonald John Trump\n\n• Term: 2017- (45th president)\n\n• Peak net worth: $3.1 billion\n\nAmerica’s current president is also the wealthiest by far. Donald Trump took over his father’s real estate company and turned it into a massive success. Through his company, Trump owns billions of dollars worth of real estate and golf courses in the United States and abroad.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nWealth is no longer a de facto prerequisite for the presidency, but thanks to the lucrative opportunities afforded to those with the title “ex-president,” wealth for those who have finished their term may be a guarantee.\n\nSeveral presidents went into debt after their time in office, but that may never happen again. Recent presidents have received multi-million dollar offers for the rights to their memoirs about life in the Oval Office. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly inked a deal worth over $60 million for the rights to their book.\n\nNet worth is always difficult to calculate, especially when comparing figures across four different centuries. In the early days of America, land ownership had significant social and political value, meaning those with the most land typically also had the most wealth.\n\nU.S. presidents have been anywhere from some of the wealthiest people in the country to being quite poor. Their wealth, however, does not seem to have an impact on the quality of their presidency. George Washington would have hundreds of millions of dollars in today’s money. Abraham Lincoln never had much money and spent much of his life doing odd jobs before getting into politics. Both are regarded as great leaders and influential figures in American history.\n\n24/7 Wall St. analyzed the finances of U.S. presidents based on historical sources. The figures are adjusted for inflation to December 2017 levels, the most recent level available. We have accounted for hard assets such as real estate, estimated lifetime savings based on work history and inheritance. We also considered annual salaries, incomes earned from royalties on books, ownership of companies, yields from family estates, and other forms of income.\n\nFor deceased presidents, the ranking is based on peak net worth, or how much a president’s combined assets were worth at the time in their life when they were the richest. Many presidents became impoverished or even went into debt after their time in office. For living presidents, the estimate is based on current figures.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

ESPN, which first reported the Semien agreement, said it was worth $175 million.\n\nSemien was a shortstop in his six seasons with Oakland from 2015-20 before starting 147 games at second base and playing all 162 games for Toronto this year. He signed an $18 million, one-year deal with the Blue Jays in free agency last offseason.\n\nThe 31-year-old Semien hit .265 and set career highs with his 45 homers, 102 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in his only season in Toronto. The 45 homers were an MLB record for a second baseman. He finished third in the AL MVP voting, like he did in 2019 when he played all 162 games for the Athletics and hit .285 with 33 homers and 92 RBIs.\n\nSemien could play shortstop or second base for the Rangers, depending on what other moves might be made this offseason.\n\nGray agreed to a four-year deal with Texas worth $56 million after spending all seven of his big league seasons with Colorado, which drafted him third overall out of Oklahoma in 2013. The 30-year-old Gray is 53-49 with a 4.59 ERA in 152 career games. In 29 starts this year, he was 8-12 with a 4.59 ERA — the same as his career mark — and had 157 strikeouts in 149 innings.\n\nThe 34-year-old Calhoun, whose one-year deal is reportedly worth $5.2 million and includes a team option for 2023, played for Arizona the past two seasons. He previously played in the AL West with the Los Angeles Angels from 2012-19.\n\nAfter a 102-loss season, the Rangers had indicated they were willing to spend as needed and could be active in free agency this offseason to improve the team. They went into the offseason with only about $28 million committed to salaries for 2022.\n\nTexas this year used a club-record 26 rookies, with at least four or five of them routinely in the lineup.\n\nThe Rangers had their fifth consecutive losing season since last winning the AL West in 2016. They finished 29th in the majors with their .232 team batting average and were shut out a majors-high 15 times while scoring an AL-low 625 runs, their fewest in a full 162-game season since 613 in 1994.\n\nSemien has a .256 batting average with 160 homers and 482 RBIs in 1,020 career games over nine seasons with the Chicago White Sox (2013-14), Oakland and Toronto.\n\nIn 1,071 career games over 10 seasons, Calhoun is a .248 hitter with 161 homers and 508 RBIs.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2017/05/09/rory-mcilroy-gets-married-players-championship/101480158/", "title": "Rory McIlroy gets married, gets used to big change to his game", "text": "Steve DiMeglio\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — Rory McIlroy has enthusiastically begun the latest chapters of his life.\n\nTwo weeks ago he married Erica Stoll in an elaborate, intimate wedding at Ashford Castle in Ireland, saying it was “obviously the best weekend of my life and hopefully the best weekend of Erica's, as well.”\n\nOn Tuesday at TPC Sawgrass ahead of Thursday’s start of The Players Championship, the PGA Tour’s showcase event, he announced his new partnership with TaylorMade.\n\nMcIlroy, who started looking for new clubs when Nike got out of the equipment business in 2016, has settled on TaylorMade’s M2 metal woods, wedges, a set of prototype blade irons and the company’s new TP5x golf ball.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFedEx, PGA Tour extend deal through 2027\n\nSergio Garcia returns to PGA Tour with 1 major win, more in his sights\n\n“I've been on Tour 10 years, and it's very rare that you get really excited about your equipment,” the four-time major champion said. “I feel like it's a new chapter in my life with a lot of stuff going on, but I really feel with the new equipment, as well, it's hopefully going to take me to that next level.”\n\nThe deal is worth $100 million over 10 years, according to a person with knowledge of the contract. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The same person said McIlroy is still under contract with Nike to wear their apparel and shoes for 10 years at $20 million per year.\n\n“It seems like with everything that's went on the last few weeks with getting married and teaming up with TaylorMade and everything, it seems like everything's very settled,” McIlroy said. “There's not many question marks going on in my life right now. I feel like everything's exactly where it's meant to be, and if you feel like that off the golf course, then I can only imagine that it will help you on it.”\n\nMcIlroy, 28, hasn’t played since he finished in a tie for seventh in the Masters. But it was at Augusta National Golf Club when McIlroy said “issues” started popping up with his game, most notably with the golf ball. So the day after he left Augusta and just before his wedding, McIlroy started experimenting.\n\n“I wasn't really happy with the golf ball I was playing and I needed to do something. I felt like I struggled in the wind,” he said. “So I sort of went back to the drawing board and tested for about 10 days pretty extensively after Augusta, worked with a lot of different things, but I worked with the TaylorMade guys one day and started just on TrackMan on the range and saw stuff with the golf ball, that new TP5x ball that they have, and I thought, ‘Wow, this is what I need.’ … I came to the conclusion that that was the best way forward for me to try and improve, try and win more, try to get back to world No. 1, try to win more majors. So I'm really excited about that.”\n\nAfter attaining the world No. 1 spot on seven different occasions — for a total of 95 weeks at the top — McIlroy is now No. 2 but nearly five points behind Dustin Johnson. After he won the 2016 FedExCup with victories in the Deutsche Bank Championship and The Tour Championship, he started his year with a playoff loss in the South African Open. But he suffered a stress fracture of a rib and was forced to sit for seven weeks.\n\nHe returned to finish in a tie for seventh in the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship and then tied for fourth in the Arnold Palmer Invitational. In his last start before the Masters he tied for 30th in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.\n\nWith all that has happened this year — the injury, the wedding, the equipment change — McIlroy hasn’t been allowed to get in a sustained rhythm. He joked that after his honeymoon he has to shed a few pounds. He still has to get used to his new equipment when he’s playing “under the gun” of a tournament to see how the ball reacts. And he’s still working with various putters to find a proper match.\n\nBut the winner of 13 Tour titles and 22 events worldwide is ready to crank up his play with many big tournaments remaining on the schedule, starting with this week’s Players. After missing the cut the first three times he played, he has become more comfortable on the arduous TPC Stadium Course. He has two ties for eighth, a tie for sixth and last year’s tie for 12th in his other four starts here.\n\nHe’s in a good place in his life and he’s at a good place this week. He’s healthy. He’s married. Now he just has to get used to his new equipment.\n\n“Everything's been great. I feel like my game's in good shape,” he said. “Obviously going in here, my first competitive event, there may be some tweaks that I need to do coming out of this event because there's just some stuff you don't learn until you put it in play in a tournament.\n\n“But I'm comfortable with what I've got right now, and I'm excited to go out on the golf course on Thursday and see how it performs.”\n\nPHOTOS: 2016-17 PGA TOUR WINNERS", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/09"}]}

I always thought they came in oysters,” he said.\n\nPearls do indeed grow in clams and several other mollusks. In this case, the clam was a northern quahog grown by Cherrystone Aqua Farms in the Chesapeake Bay. Salt Air staff confirmed the origin of the clam, and Ballard Clams and Oysters spokesman Tim Parsons confirmed the species.\n\nQuahogs produce non-nacreous, porcelain-like pearls, according to the Gemological Institute of America. They are rarely spherical, and buttonlike specimens such as Overland’s are the most common.

The Rev. Mike Lewis of the Selma Bridge Lights Project gave an update on the timeline last week. Lewis had proposed the idea in 2017 as a way of attracting more people to visit the city, The Selma Times-Journal reports. About 600 protesters marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a day in 1965 that became known as Bloody Sunday. The late civil rights leader John Lewis, leading the demonstrators across the bridge in a protest for voting rights, was knocked to the ground and beaten by law enforcement officers. The violence on the bridge focused the nation’s attention on racial oppression in the South. “When people think of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, they think of Selma. The lighting of the Edmund Pettus Bridge will honor the foot soldiers and civil rights,” the Rev. Mike Lewis said. There are plans to have different lights for various occasions, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Rental rates across the state have risen during the pandemic, and it’s more difficult to find an apartment, a new study indicates. The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development survey shows a median adjusted rent for all unit types in Alaska at $1,179 a month in 2021, a 2% increase from spring 2020, Alaska Public Media reports. Sitka had the highest median rental rate at $1,323, the survey shows, while Wrangell and Petersburg were the lowest at $950. In Anchorage, the state’s largest city, the rent was $1,172, up 2.8% over 2020. The largest increase came in Ketchikan, where the average rent rose nearly 10% to $1,230 this year. However, the survey notes that electricity and water rates had just been approved at the time of the survey, and that anticipated increase might have been a factor. Vacancy rates dropped almost everywhere across the state. State economist Rob Krieger said that amid the pandemic, fewer people moved to a new rental, and there were fewer people shifting from renting to buying their first home. Rising home purchase prices and low interest rates are also making it difficult for first-time buyers in a competitive housing market, “especially when you consider that an average mortgage payment is now significantly higher than the average rent,” Krieger said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Political wonks and interested citizens can help draw the state’s new congressional and legislative districts. Mapping software made available by the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission will allow computer users to examine new rough drafts of the districts combined with the latest census data. More tech-savvy folks can tinker with the software, at tiny.cc/arizmap, to create new district boundaries based on population and demographics, then submit their handiwork to the commission, which may use some of the ideas in the commission’s final maps. The five-member commission conducted 15 “listening tour” events around the state in July and August and is scheduled to discuss and adopt grid maps at its Tuesday meeting. Those maps look nothing like the final redistricting maps, displaying contiguous boxes that contain roughly equal portions of Arizona’s more than 7 million inhabitants, as based on the 2020 census. The maps split the population evenly among the nine congressional and 30 legislative districts. With this raw clay, plus the ideas heard and yet to be heard from the public in the coming weeks, the commissioners will redraw the boundaries for the next 10 years. Hearings on the draft maps will continue through November, with the final product coming out the next month.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 31 more COVID-19 deaths and 646 new cases Monday. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the coronavirus since the pandemic began rose to 7,298. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 12 of the newly reported deaths Monday were delayed reports from before the previous 24 hours. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dipped slightly, by five, to 1,113. Arkansas ranks 15th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. There are 443 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state and 246 on ventilators. The department said 40 ICU beds are available in the state, though it’s unclear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLivermore: About 3,100 acres of open space in the San Francisco Bay Area could soon be preserved as a state park under a $31 million deal struck by Bay Area lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deal would keep the area from becoming part of a neighboring off-road vehicle park. The agreement has been cast as a way to safeguard the ecological and cultural significance of the land east of Livermore, Democratic Sen. Steve Glazer of Orinda, who has advocated for the land’s preservation since 2018, said in a statement. The land known as the Tesla parcel borders the Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area, which had planned to expand into the land, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Scientists say the land is a “biologically unique habitat,” and Native Americans consider it a “sensitive historical site,” Glazer’s office said in a statement. Under the agreement, the state would reimburse the Off-Highway Vehicle Trust Fund for the land and other costs and pay for development of a new off-roading park elsewhere. The land, home to several threatened and endangered wildlife species, is designated a California Native Plant Society Botanical Priority Protection Area and has been deemed an Audubon Important Bird Area. It is named after the historic town and Tesla coal mine established on the site in the 19th century.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers violated a man’s constitutional rights when they installed a video camera on a utility pole near his home and spied on him for months without getting a search warrant. The justices said the 24-hour-a-day, 3-month-long surveillance of the Colorado Springs man’s front yard, house, driveway and part of his backyard violated his Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, The Denver Post reports. His conviction and 15-year-prison sentence for drug trafficking were overturned. The unanimous decision differentiates between police officers personally watching suspects and officers using technology to record a person’s every move for extended periods of time. The man had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his yard, even though parts of the area were visible to the public, the court found. And the Colorado Springs Police Department should have received a search warrant before setting up the camera, which could pan and zoom to see over the man’s 6-foot-tall fence. The justices also rejected the state’s argument that the surveillance wasn’t as intrusive as GPS tracking or the use of cellphone data, noting that constant surveillance “shares many of the troubling attributes of GPS tracking.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: For years, many Native American tribes have felt their history has not been given its due by schools in Connecticut, a state that takes its name from an Algonquian word meaning “land on the long tidal river.” Soon, however, schools will be required to teach Native American studies, with an emphasis on local tribes, under a law passed this year at the urging of tribes including the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, best known today for its Foxwoods Resort Casino. “When you’re in Connecticut, to not learn about the Eastern woodland tribes, the tribes that Connecticut was founded on, (that) was the issue that we were pressing,” said Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots. The legislation makes it mandatory for schools to teach Native American studies starting with the 2023-2024 school year. It passed despite concerns raised by teachers unions and state Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona. Now the U.S. education secretary, Cardona had said it is important to teach about Native Americans, but he was wary of unfunded mandates for school districts that are still working to implement other courses that lawmakers and the governor have required them to teach.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Beebe Healthcare and Tidal Health will temporarily pause elective surgeries due to spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations, officials said Monday. Beebe’s announcement, which went into effect Tuesday, is “out of an abundance of caution,” officials said. In the early weeks of the pandemic, nearly all Delaware hospitals paused elective procedures, but they resumed them months later. TidalHealth also announced Monday that its hospitals would temporarily stop “elective, non-emergency surgeries that require an overnight stay for at least a two-week period,” according to a news release. “Several factors have combined recently to put stress on hospital staffing levels and hospital bed capacity at both TidalHealth hospitals,” officials said. Since August, Delaware has seen an explosion of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. As of Monday, 266 people were hospitalized in the state – heights Delaware has not seen since the winter. Nearly all of the people being hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, health officials say.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police have taken several steps to prepare their departments and the city as a whole in advance of a rally planned at the Capitol on Saturday in support of Jan. 6 defendants, WUSA-TV reports. USCP officers were seen installing surveillance cameras around the area of the U.S. Capitol on Monday morning. Some areas near the home of the legislative branch have already been boarded up, and several robotic cameras were placed at different locations. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. “We are here to protect everyone’s First Amendment right to peacefully protest,” USCP Chief Tom Manger said in a statement. “I urge anyone who is thinking about causing trouble to stay home. We will enforce the law and not tolerate violence.” Manger said a fence will go up around the Capitol again a few days before the rally and come down soon after if everything is peaceful. The Metropolitan Police Department has also activated its entire force and postponed vacation days for its officers. The full activation alert assigned specific notice to MPD civil disturbance units trained for First Amendment demonstrations.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: Attorney Mike Freed has left his mark locally cultivating an annual series of marathons raising money for Jacksonville Area Legal Aid. Now he’s asking lawyers around the country to donate their time to help to prevent a deluge of evictions rooted in the pandemic’s effect on jobs and incomes. “Sometimes you have to give up your time without compensation for the greater good,” said Freed, who is president of the National Conference of Bar Presidents, an organization involving Bar associations in 53 states and U.S. territories. Freed, an attorney at the Gunster law firm who organizes a yearly six-day series of six marathons called Freed to Run, used online messages to highlight a letter signed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking lawyers to prevent an eviction tsunami, writing that “no matter where you live, lawyers and law students like you can apply your legal training and skills to help your community.” Coming days after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a federal moratorium on evictions during the pandemic, the pleas reacted to a situation that is growing more dire for many tenants. In Duval County, judges hearing eviction lawsuits last month issued 530 orders for police to serve writs of possession and take homes back from renters. Landlords filed another 737 eviction lawsuits last month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCalhoun: A northwest Georgia county is negotiating an agreement for its employees to work extra at the local hospital, which is over capacity due to COVID-19 patients. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports Gordon County commissioners are near a deal to let county employees assist at AdventHealth Gordon when not working for the county. The hospital would pay the employees. County Administrator Jim Ledbetter said a number of firefighters and law enforcement personnel are interested. People who volunteer to work extra hours must be vaccinated against COVID-19 before their first shifts. “With the hospital being licensed for 69 patients and having more than 100, the labor force is stretched pretty thin, and staff are pretty tired,” Ledbetter said. “The hospital came to us for help, and we decided to do what we can.” Ledbetter said the county will require employees have at least 12 hours’ rest between their county shifts and hospital work. He said hospital doctors and nurses will supervise county employees. He said duties might include stocking supplies and making sure people are wearing masks before coming in. “They would help with security. People’s nerves have been frayed with the pandemic, and they don’t always want to mask. Some people have been getting testy about that,” Ledbetter said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The median sale price for a single-family home on the island of Oahu has surpassed $1 million. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the median price in August reached $1,050,000, according to Honolulu Board of Realtors data. “Market conditions have been pointing to a $1M median single-family home price this year for some time,” Jason Lazzerini, president and CEO of the brokerage firm Locations, wrote in a report last month. The Honolulu Board of Realtors said the record was up 25% from $839,000 in the same month last year. The August peak for single-family homes was the seventh monthly record set this year. The islands of Kauai and Maui hit the million-dollar mark in January and May, respectively. Hawaii economist Paul Brewbaker said that “this is not a bubble” and that he expects the demand will eventually ease. “This is transitory,” Brewbaker said. “We need to put that in perspective.” He said demand has been driven in part by stay-at-home workers during the pandemic. Honolulu Board of Realtors President Shannon Heaven said the August spike was driven by a tripling of homes sold for more than $2 million. “Those really begin to push that median price up,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An arrest warrant has been issued for a former state lawmaker who resigned in disgrace after a 19-year-old intern reported that he brought her to his apartment on false pretenses and raped her. The Ada County arrest warrant on charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object came nearly five months after Aaron von Ehlinger, R-Lewiston, resigned from the Idaho House of Representatives after an ethics committee found he should be formally censured for his behavior. The investigation into von Ehlinger began in March after the young staffer reported he raped her after the two had dinner at a Boise restaurant. Von Ehlinger has denied all wrongdoing and maintains he had consensual sexual contact with the young woman. A legislative ethics committee unanimously found that he engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and said it would support a vote to remove him from the Statehouse. The woman informed legislative leadership and the police about the rape allegations on her first day at work after the incident. She also testified before the legislative ethics committee, despite facing harassment from von Ehlinger’s supporters and some fellow lawmakers. Earlier this month attorney Erika Birch reportedly filed a tort claim with the state on the woman’s behalf, which is the first step in filing a lawsuit.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two nuclear plants would be saved from closure and carbon-emitting coal plants closed during the next quarter-century as part of a clean-energy package the state Senate approved Monday, sending it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has pushed for a carbon-free Illinois by 2045. With just one vote over the minimum necessary, the 37-17 tally in the chamber controlled by Democrats came on the same day energy company Exelon had threatened to begin shutting down its nuclear-power generating station in Byron as unprofitable, with the Dresden generating site in Morris to follow this fall. But the Clean Energy Jobs Act provides a $700 million subsidy to Exelon with the idea of saving jobs and the large amount of carbon-free energy the plants already produce. “The state of Illinois is making history by setting aggressive standards for a 100% clean energy future,” Pritzker said in a post-vote statement. In addition to the nuclear-power subsidy, the legislation includes provisions for closing coal-burning plants in central and southwest Illinois, investing in renewable energy such as wind and solar, and offering $4,000 rebates on electric-vehicle purchases. Pritzker wants 1 million electric cars on Illinois roads by 2030. Plants producing greenhouse gases by burning coal must cut those emissions by 45% by 2035 and close permanently by 2045.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Republican redistricting plan shores up a suburban Indianapolis district for the GOP while leaving a potentially targeted Democratic district in northwestern Indiana intact. The proposal for new congressional districts released Tuesday shifts the northern tier of Democratic-leaning Marion County from the district now held by Republican Rep. Victora Spartz to that of Indianapolis Democratic Rep. Andre Carson. That move will boost Spartz, who lost badly in Marion County in last year’s election even as she won by an overall 50%-46% margin over Democratic candidate Christina Hale. Other changes among Indiana’s nine congressional districts to account for population shifts don’t appear likely to shift the 7-2 control that Republicans now hold on those seats. The Republican plan leaves intact the northwestern Indiana district that includes industry-heavy Lake County and has long been a Democratic stronghold. The proposed district along Lake Michigan wouldn’t change much from the one Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan won last year. Republicans have full control Indiana’s redistricting process through their dominance of the state Legislature.\n\nIowa\n\nMount Ayr: A woman whose husband died from a breakthrough COVID-19 infection is blaming Americans who refuse to wear masks or get vaccinated. “It’s that kind of attitude that killed my husband,” said Ardith Keplinger, whose husband, Gary Keplinger, of Mount Ayr, was buried this month. In his obituary, the family wrote that his life was “unnecessarily cut short.” They described the retired school superintendent as “one of several victims recently infected from an unmasked, unvaccinated person.” His widow said he had a chronic autoimmune, neuromuscular condition called myasthenia gravis, which may have made him particularly susceptible when he attended a gathering of 50 to 75 extended family members in a rented hall in July. The couple had been avoiding crowds, but they mingled unmasked at the event, along with relatives, several of whom were unvaccinated, Ardith Keplinger said. “Within a week, 11 members of our family had COVID,” she said, adding that she was among them but recovered. But her husband and a cousin who also attended the party both died of the disease Aug. 11. The Iowa Department of Public Health reports vaccinated people make up just 10% of those being treated for the disease in the state’s intensive care units, even though 64% of Iowa adults have received the shots.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Hundreds of people chanted and held signs outside a University of Kansas fraternity house where a member is accused of sexually assaulting another student. The Kansas City Star reports the Monday night protest outside the Phi Kappa Psi house came after the fraternity officials reported the allegations over the weekend. “The university takes seriously all allegations of sexual violence and has robust processes to investigate such allegations,” university spokeswoman Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said in an email Tuesday. “We encourage anyone who has experienced sexual violence to contact law enforcement or the university’s Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to initiate an investigation.” The university has multiple resources to assist individuals who have experienced sexual violence, she said. A spokesman for the fraternity said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. “Phi Kappa Psi takes these allegations very seriously and will fully cooperate with law enforcement,” the statement said. “Due to the recent nature of these allegations and the need for a full and complete investigation, Phi Kappa Psi cannot provide further comments at this time.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Union workers, upset over the prospect of expanded weekend shifts, have manned picket lines at bottling and warehouse operations of Heaven Hill Distillery, one of the world’s largest bourbon producers. The walkout involves about 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D. They voted overwhelmingly last week to reject a new five-year contract offer and formed picket lines Saturday at Heaven Hill’s operations in Bardstown. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons, and others including Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection. As the bourbon industry tries to keep up with increasing global demand, Heaven Hill signaled it wanted to assign new hires to nontraditional schedules that would include weekend work, Local 23D President Matt Aubrey said. The company was vague about how widespread weekend shifts would be and how it would affect existing workers, he said, raising a “red flag” with union workers. “They tell these workers, ‘You’re family, just like us. You’re our family,’ ” Aubrey said, adding that most workers have their own families. “If they get pushed on this nontraditional schedule, then that’s going to take them away from their loved ones.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSlidell: A 12-foot-long alligator believed to have attacked a man in Hurricane Ida floodwaters two weeks ago was captured and killed Monday, and authorities found human remains in its stomach. The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office said the parish coroner’s office was working with investigators to determine if the remains were those of Timothy Satterlee, 71, who has been missing since the Aug. 30 attack. Ida had caused widespread flooding and knocked out electricity and phone service in parts of south Louisiana when it came ashore Aug. 29. Satterlee was attacked outside his home, which was surrounded by floodwaters, in the New Orleans suburb of Slidell on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Authorities said Satterlee’s wife heard a splash and walked outside their home to see the alligator attacking her husband. She managed to pull him, severely injured in the attack, to the steps of their home and used a small boat to reach higher ground to get help. But when she and deputies returned to the house, Satterlee was gone. Sheriff’s deputies were joined by federal and state wildlife agents in the search for the alligator. A trap set by alligator hunters captured the 500-pound animal Monday morning.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: Potato growers anticipate a solid crop and stronger demand thanks to reopening restaurants, providing a sense of optimism heading into the harvest in northern Maine. Another positive indicator: A decline in acreage was reversed with an extra 8,000 acres planted this summer. “Growing conditions have been really good. We have a quality crop, and we expect good yields. Market demand is good,” said Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board. Growers are looking for something to cheer after a dismal 2020 in which some farmers gave away potatoes to avoid having them go to waste, and crops withered from heat and drought in northern Maine. This summer, rainfall was nearly 3 inches below average, but that’s better than last summer, which ranked as the warmest and second-driest since records were kept in Caribou, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures hitting 90 and above can stunt the growth of potatoes, but the highest temperature this summer was 84 degrees, Flannery said. Potatoes are big business in Maine, with direct sales in the neighborhood of $300 million supporting about 2,400 jobs. About 65% of Maine’s potatoes are processed into french fries, chips or some other product, and demand for processed potatoes is rebounding.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A panel of state lawmakers approved an emergency measure Tuesday to require masks in K-12 schools to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The 10-7 vote by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review puts the emergency regulation into effect for up to 180 days. The Maryland State Board of Education approved the regulation last month on an 11-1 vote. Only two of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions, Carroll and Somerset counties, had not already required students to wear masks while attending school. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended universal mask-wearing for teachers and students inside school buildings this fall, citing the rapid spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. Maryland State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said the mask requirement will increase safety and help reduce the need for quarantining sick students. “Seventeen other states, including most of Maryland’s neighbors, have required that all individuals wear masks in school buildings,” Choudhury said. He said data will be reviewed each month, and the board of education will consider whether the requirement could be lifted, if conditions improve enough, in consultation with the state health department.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Harvard University will divest itself from holdings in fossil fuels, President Lawrence Bacow said Thursday. Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s nearly $42 billion endowment, has already been reducing its exposure to fossil fuels and has no direct investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels, Bacow said in a message posted on the university’s website. The university has legacy investments in a number of private equity funds with holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Those indirect investments constitute less than 2% of the endowment, according to Bacow. The school has not made any new commitments to these limited partnerships since 2019 and has no intention to do so going forward, he said. Bacow said the legacy investments are in “runoff mode” and will end as these partnerships are liquidated. Harvard has already committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire investment portfolio by 2050, he said. The decision follows years of protests from students who have pressed Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies. Harvard is building a portfolio of investments in funds that support the transition to a green economy, Bacow wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig formally announced his campaign for governor Tuesday – but not before protesters derailed his kickoff event on Belle Isle and forced him to move. Craig effectively has been running for months. He is among 10 Republicans, all of them political newcomers, looking to unseat Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022. Craig was to speak to the media at the state park in the middle of the Detroit River in his hometown, but he abandoned that plan when he was shouted down by a couple dozen people critical of his role as chief. He turned around and walked back toward a waiting vehicle, which took him to a nearby office complex, where he made the announcement a short time later. “My name is James Craig. And I’m running to be your governor,” he said, flashing a thumbs-up. “The governor for the state of Michigan.” He nodded as supporters chanted: “Chief Craig.” As for the disruption on Belle Isle, Craig said a “small group of paid protesters did nothing. What they did is reinforce why we need change.” Asked about his statement that the protesters were paid, Craig said he did not have evidence of that but believed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Four former police officers charged with violating George Floyd’s civil rights pleaded not guilty Tuesday in a federal hearing that included arguments on several pretrial motions, including requests to hold separate trials. A federal grand jury indicted Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao in May for allegedly depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority May 25, 2020, as Floyd, 46, was held face-down, handcuffed and not resisting in a restraint that was captured on bystander video. His death led to worldwide protests and calls for change in policing. All four of the men appeared at the hearing remotely via videoconference. Chauvin, wearing a plain T-shirt, appeared from a small room in the state’s maximum-security prison, where he is serving a 22 1/ 2 -year sentence for murder in Floyd’s death. The other three men appeared remotely alongside their attorneys. U.S. Magistrate Judge Tony Leung asked each man separately how he would plea, and each clearly responded: “Not guilty.” The hearing also addressed roughly 40 pretrial motions. Most of the motions were routine, such as agreeing when names of witnesses would be disclosed. But Leung heard oral arguments on two issues and ordered attorneys to file additional written arguments on those motions.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: A third person has died as a result of a highway collapse two weeks ago. Amanda Williams of Wiggins died Saturday after being hospitalized since the Aug. 30 collapse, WLOX-TV reports. The collapse on Highway 26 outside Lucedale in George County, which occurred during torrential rain brought by Hurricane Ida, caused seven vehicles to crash into the washed-out roadway. Two people died at the time of the crash, and 10 others were injured, including 39-year-old Wiggins and her 16-year-old daughter, Emily. Emily Williams is currently recovering from a torn colon, a broken leg and other injuries. Amanda Williams was being treated for her injuries at Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg when she died, according to WLOX. During a Sept. 5 video interview with WLOX-TV, Emily Williams said she could hear the terrifying sounds of other vehicles crashing around – and on top of – the pickup truck where she and her mother were trapped after the truck plunged into a dark, muddy pit when the highway collapsed. “I saw a black hole, then I blacked out, and I woke up, and my mom was leaned over toward me. She was choking on her blood, and she couldn’t breathe or anything,” she told the television station.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A cave containing Native American artwork from more than 1,000 years ago was sold at auction Tuesday, disappointing leaders of the Osage Nation who hoped to buy the land to “protect and preserve our most sacred site.” A bidder agreed to pay $2.2 million to private owners for what’s known as “Picture Cave,” along with the 43 hilly acres that surround it near the town of Warrenton, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Bryan Laughlin, director of Selkirk Auctioneers & Appraisers, the St. Louis-based firm handling the auction, said the winning bidder declined to be named. A St. Louis family that’s owned the land since 1953 has mainly used it for hunting. The cave was the site of sacred rituals and burying of the dead. It also has more than 290 prehistoric glyphs, “making it the largest collection of indigenous people’s polychrome paintings in Missouri,” according to the auction website. The Osage Nation, in a statement, called the sale “truly heartbreaking.” “Our ancestors lived in this area for 1300 years,” the statement said. “This was our land. We have hundreds of thousands of our ancestors buried throughout Missouri and Illinois, including Picture Cave.” The cave features drawings of people, animals, birds and mythical creatures.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: The U.S. Forest Service has given preliminary approval to a plan for road building, logging and other forest management measures in the Swan Valley with the goal of reducing fire danger and enhancing habitat for several federally protected species, the agency said. The project area is located on U.S. Forest Service lands on both sides of Montana Highway 83 between the communities of Condon and Swan Lake. “Species such as Canada lynx, bull trout and whitebark pine face unprecedented risk from climate change, exotic pathogens and all the associated ecological impacts, and failure to act will most likely result in their continued decline,” Flathead National Forest Supervisor Kurt Steele wrote in a draft record of a decision published Friday. “A warming and drier climate, combined with the legacy effects of fire suppression, requires active vegetation management, and the scientific knowledge applied to this decision has been shown to be an effective prescription to mitigate these risks.” The agency plans to approve about half of its initially proposed 15-year project. Doing so will reduce plans for logging, road building and improvement, and the number of acres where trees are to be thinned or burned with fires called prescribed burns set in certain areas to reduce wildfire risks, the Daily Inter Lake reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers launched a special session Monday to redraw the state’s political boundaries, with one proposal that would add a 50th state senator to the Legislature to try to keep rural Nebraska from losing a seat. Sen. Mark Kolterman, of Seward, proposed the measure along with two other rural senators. The bill would expand the Legislature from its current 49 members to 50, as allowed under the Nebraska Constitution. Adding a senator would reduce the ideal number of residents per legislative district, making it easier for lawmakers to preserve rural districts that lost population over the past decade while still adding a district to fast-growing suburban Omaha. The bill’s prospects are unclear, and some lawmakers questioned whether they could legally consider it in a special session that’s strictly limited to redistricting issues. Lawmakers have asked the state’s attorney general to offer a legal opinion. Even so, rural senators said they planned to press the issue as a way to ease pressure on senators by reducing the average number of residents per district. The measure was co-sponsored by Sens. Matt Williams, of Gothenburg, and John Stinner, of Gering. “I want to help protect the rural senators of the state,” said Kolterman, whose district could be merged with another rural area under one of the proposed plans.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A national advocacy group has filed a sweeping federal lawsuit aimed at convincing a judge the nation’s only legal brothels are dens of illegal sex trafficking and unconstitutional slavery. The case filed Friday in Las Vegas by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation names the governor, state attorney general, and city and county officials as defendants, along with a brothel in Nye County and hip-hop music figure Jamal “Mally Mall” Rashid. Rashid, 46, is serving a 33-month federal prison term after pleading guilty to operating a prostitution business disguised as a Las Vegas escort enterprise. Attorneys who represented him in that case did not immediately respond to a message about the lawsuit. Representatives of Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, state Attorney General Aaron Ford, Las Vegas and Clark County declined to comment. Officials in Nye County and the Chicken Ranch brothel in Pahrump did not immediately respond to messages. The lawsuit seeks to abolish Nevada’s legal prostitution statutes as unconstitutional and a violation of federal anti-trafficking laws. It asks the court to order reimbursement to victims of “all profits and unjust enrichment obtained as a result.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A man has been accused of putting his baby daughter into a clothes dryer and turning on the machine before the mother quickly stopped it, police said. Police arrested the man in Manchester on Sunday on charges of reckless conduct, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal threatening. The child did not appear to be injured. The man waived arraignment Monday, and a judge ordered him held without bail. His case has been assigned to a public defender’s office, but no attorney was listed for him in court documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The Sea Hear Now music festival returns to town this upcoming weekend after the 2020 event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. And this year’s fest will have some musicians showing off their other artistic talents, too. Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and other members of Pearl Jam, Scott Avett of the Avett Brothers, and more will show their artwork inside the Transparent Gallery pop-up Saturday and Sunday in Bradley Park. In past festivals, musicians have popped into the gallery for an impromptu performance. Musically, the fest – held on the beach and in Bradley Park – will also feature acts including Billy Idol, Lord Huron, Dr. Dog, Grouplove, Orville Peck, Ani DiFranco, and Tank and the Bangas. More than 35,000 people attended the second Sea Hear Now in 2019 to see groups such as the Dave Matthews Band and the Lumineers. Organizers expect about 35,000 this year, but there will be more room on the beach, as the two stages will be farther apart by about a city block. Construction on the festival grounds started over the weekend. Attendees will need to require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election officials are deploying ballot drop boxes across the state for people who choose to cast absentee ballots without walking indoors during the upcoming Nov. 2 local elections for public offices including the mayors of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told a legislative panel Monday that county clerks are required to provide one drop box for every 25,000 voters and at least two per county. Exceptions can be made at the request of local county officials. The quick-drop boxes for voting are among a long list measures backed by Toulouse Oliver, a second-term Democrat, that are aimed at making voting more accessible. Lawmakers appropriated funding for the initiative amid concerns about COVID-19 and indoor crowding at polling places. Ballots must be collected at least once a day from the boxes, video surveillance of drop boxes is required, and recordings must be retained by county clerks. It remains illegal for any person to deliver a ballot for another person with the exception of immediate family, and signs at each drop box are required to explain that prohibition against so-called ballot harvesting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Parents of adults with severe autism and other disabilities say state officials are threatening to revoke funding for their children’s long-term care at out-of-state care centers unless they agree to send their children to a secure, in-state facility. Some parents believe they have no alternative but to send their adult children to the Sunmount Developmental Center in Franklin County in the Adirondacks, the Times Union of Albany reports. They describe the facility as remote and prison-like. A group of state lawmakers recently asked Gov. Kathy Hochul to end the policy, which they say was put in place by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in an apparent cost-saving move. The lawmakers, including Democratic Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi of New York City, say the policy may violate disabled people’s right to receive care in the least restrictive setting, which was guaranteed under a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A 2014 state law also guaranteed due-process rights for disabled children and their families in long-term care decisions, when the child turns 21 or graduates from school. In a response Friday, the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities said a legal process prevents the agency from providing funding for out-of-state care at a certain point.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: A fund set up to honor George Floyd and raise awareness about racial injustice said Monday that it has awarded more than $50,000 in scholarships since it was created. The Fayetteville-based George Floyd Memorial Foundation said it has recently given scholarships valued at $1,000 to 15 law school students, scholarships valued at $10,000 to interns, and $2,500 scholarships to undergraduate students. The foundation said it has also awarded $25,000 to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college. Foundation executive director Jacari Harris said the scholarships keep Floyd’s memory alive and support students. “Our hope at the George Floyd Memorial Foundation is that these high-achieving students will become attorneys, activists and scholars who will work to ensure people are treated fairly around the world,” Harris said in a statement. Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd’s sister and the foundation’s founder, said that “as the days, months and years go by, one thing is true: My brother George’s death truly changed the world, and by offering support to these students, it will allow us to continue to bring hope to those in need.” The foundation, created in August 2020, focuses on raising awareness of racial injustices, police brutality and ensuring everyone’s civil rights are protected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A three-day symposium to discuss the history and revitalization of the American bison has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, event organizers said Monday. The Dakota Bison Symposium had been scheduled for Thursday through Saturday. Many of the national speakers have recently decided against traveling to North Dakota, where 1 in every 253 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. It is also one of the worst states in the country for rate of COVID-19 vaccinations. Bismarck State College and its partners decided against a virtual format and rescheduled the event for next spring, BSC President Doug Jensen told The Bismarck Tribune. “One of the exciting things about symposia is getting to rub elbows with these national speakers,” Jensen said. “Within the last few weeks, we’ve lost that aspect of the conference.” The symposium also was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The North Dakota Department of Health on Monday confirmed 180 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,815 active cases throughout the state. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by nearly 48%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republicans and Democrats appeared closer to agreement Monday on a map of state legislative districts that could stand for the next 10 years, as a powerful new redistricting panel faced a looming Wednesday deadline. But a group that monitors redistricting and works to reduce the drawing of political district lines that maximize partisan advantage, a process called gerrymandering, flunked the Ohio GOP’s proposed state House map in an analysis released earlier Monday. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, working with the anti-corruption group RepresentUS, said its boundaries fell short of being fair when compared to a million simulated alternatives, delivering it a score of “F.” The analysis gave a better score of “B” to the Ohio Senate map that Republicans have proposed, which Democratic consultant Chris Glassburn also reworked and presented Monday. Analysts said the second map fared better because each Senate district contains three House districts, diluting the partisan advantage. During a regional hearing in suburban Cleveland, members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission’s GOP majority – including state Auditor Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Senate President Matt Huffman praised Glassburn, for his work on a revised map aimed at garnering the support of both parties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials said Tuesday that coronavirus hospitalizations appear to be leveling off, but hospital stays are longer due to the delta variant of the virus. The three-day average of new COVID-19 hospitalizations fell from 1,518 a week ago to 1,352 on Tuesday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which reported a seven-day average of 2,114 new cases daily, down from 2,709 one week ago. However, the average hospitalization increased from five to six days in January to 10-11 days currently, and intensive acre unit stays rose from 10-11 days to 15-20, said Dr. David Kendrick, chair of Medical Informatics at the University of Oklahoma School of Community Medicine. Patti Davis, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said it is too soon to call the decline a trend. “Given … Labor Day activities, all health care providers probably have their fingers crossed and are hoping for the best, but not assuming (the decline) will hold once we get at the requisite date past Labor Day,” which could result in another surge in cases, Davis said. Kendrick said most new virus cases are among younger patients; 21.6% are 36-49 years old, and those ages 18-35 account for about 18% of new cases.\n\nOregon\n\nTroutdale: An explosion in a pickup truck killed a man early Monday, authorities said. Police and firefighters responded to calls at 2:19 a.m. reporting a loud explosion and vehicle fire at a home , the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said. The Gresham Fire Department extinguished the fire, and the sheriff’s office said a person was located inside the burned vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The body was taken to the county Medical Examiner’s Office. The case and manner of death are yet to be determined. Investigators are not yet releasing the identity of the man, the sheriff’s office said. Special agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Seattle branch are assisting the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office and other agencies in the investigation. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the explosion, which is believed to have originated inside the vehicle, according to the sheriff’s office. No other injuries were reported, and the sheriff’s office said there was no threat of additional explosions. “We woke up with a big explosion, and things were falling in the house, so I thought the house was falling down,” neighbor JoAnn Robinson told KGW-TV. The siding on Robinson’s home is covered in holes from debris.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: More than $104 million in Pennsylvania Turnpike tolls went uncollected last year as the agency fully converted to all-electronic tolling, with the millions of motorists who don’t use E-ZPass having a nearly 1 in 2 chance of riding without paying under the “toll-by-plate” license plate camera system. An internal turnpike report issued in July and obtained by the Associated Press through a Right-to-Know Law request showed nearly 11 million out of the total of about 170 million turnpike rides generated no revenue for the agency in the year that ended May 31. “We take this issue very seriously. It is a big number, there’s no question,” turnpike Chief Executive Mark Compton said. “But we, as an organization, are leaving no stone unturned in the way in which we’re going after that leakage.” Toll revenue “leakage” – an industry euphemism for uncollected tolls – has become the focus of turnpike agencies across the country as the use of E-ZPass transponders and license plate cameras continues to spread. It is a particular problem for the debt-strapped Pennsylvania Turnpike, more than half of whose total revenue goes to pay borrowing costs and tolls have more than quadrupled in 12 years for the minority of motorists who don’t have E-Z Pass to pay for rides.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has paused in-person dining and instituted a limit of five people for undergraduate social gatherings in response to a recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. The Ivy League school had 82 confirmed coronavirus cases, primarily among undergraduate students, in the prior seven days, according to a statement Monday. “The increase in positive asymptomatic test results is a reflection of the transmissibility of the delta variant, our significant increase in the number of tests conducted at Brown, and an increase in our student population, some of whom have been engaging with other students in multiple smaller groups outside the classroom, especially indoors without masks,” the school’s statement said. Those testing positive generally remain asymptomatic, and there are no indications of serious illness and no hospitalizations, the school said. There is no evidence of spread in classrooms, and classes will continue, the school said. The “short-term” restrictions also include increased undergraduate student testing from once to twice per week and an indoor mask requirement. Brown requires vaccinations for students and employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: Residents of an Upstate neighborhood say they were ducking for cover after pellets from a nearby dove hunt started striking them. Children playing outside were also struck by the pellets, one of them as he played on a trampoline, WYFF-TV reports. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources responded to calls Saturday afternoon about the stray pellets coming from a field in Greenwood County. Neighbors said they saw 10 to 20 people in the field hunting doves. Department of Natural resources officials said they talked to several people who say they were hit, including a 6-year-old boy who had two marks on his cheek. The land is private property, and the landowner wasn’t doing anything illegal, authorities said. There is no state law or regulation mandating the minimum distance from other homes or properties from a dove hunt on private land. Officials said they talked to the landowner, who voluntarily stopped the hunt due to safety and noise concerns. Neighbors said the children struck by pellets were OK.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Monday rejected a handful of proposals for rules governing medical marijuana from Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration but approved the bulk of the program. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee, which is responsible for approving administration rules, effectively told the Department of Health to try again on a number of controversial rule proposals. Most of the Department of Health’s 124-page proposal got the sign-off from the Legislature, spelling out rules ranging from fees for cardholders to the heights of fences around cannabis growing facilities. The rules they rejected included proposals that would have limited the amount of high-potency marijuana that patients could possess, required medical practitioners to write a recommendation for patients who wanted to grow more than three cannabis plants, and defined a list of conditions that would qualify for a medical marijuana recommendation. The law allowing medical marijuana, passed by 70% of voters last year, has seen a halting acceptance from officials trying to balance a clear mandate from voters while placing restrictions on medical marijuana. The rules set a $75 application fee for medical marijuana cards and discount the fee to $20 for low-income applicants.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Rhodes College is investigating after students reported racist and anti-Semitic incidents on campus a few weeks into the fall semester. In one instance, a banana was taped to the door of a dorm room of two Black students, student organization Men of Distinction has said. The group called for more swift and public response by the college. Interim President Carroll D. Stevens wrote to campus last Friday: “Whatever the intentions when actions or words make members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, they do not align with our values as a college community.” The president’s letter did not specify particular incidents on campus but said the incidents made Black and Jewish students in particular feel unsafe. Kofi Whitehead, student president of Men of Distinction, immediately called leaders of the organization together. He knew the students targeted by the Labor Day incident, he said, but it could have been “any of us.” In a post days after it happened, Men of Distinction decried the lack of response from the Rhodes administration. In an interview Monday, Whitehead said he acknowledged that internally, campus leadership was likely working to address the issue. But when a racist incident occurs in a public place, and students see it across social media, he expects the college to be more upfront.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Travis County commissioners voted unanimously Tuesday to allocate $110million in federal funds to build housing units for people experiencing homelessness in the area. The vote was met by applause from the group of homelessness service providers and community leaders gathered in the commissioners’ court chambers. The vote marks a significant investment in housing projects from the county – a change from the commissioners’ initial reluctance to spend money directly on housing units. Commissioner Margaret Gomez, who developed and sponsored the plan with Commissioner Ann Howard and a diverse coalition of local community leaders and organizations, said after years of discussion on the need to address affordable housing issues and homelessness in the Austin area, it was time for something different. “I think it’s time we take some action here,” Gomez said. The $110 million comes from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, which was the second of two federal stimulus programs created during the coronavirus pandemic. Travis County received $247 million from the program and had wide discretion on how to spend it. The funding will go toward the construction of 10 or so projects that would total more than 2,000 new housing units.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man who displayed a rifle at a youth soccer tournament, spreading panic through the crowd, wasn’t prompted by anything related to the game, police said Monday. People screamed “active shooter” as parents and players ran to take cover behind cars in the parking lot after the man retrieved the gun from his car Saturday afternoon, the Deseret News reports. Ultimately no shots were fired, but it was terrifying for many who were there. “It was pretty traumatizing,” said parent Megan Perkins. “My kid is pretty shaken.” The man had been involved in an argument at the game when he went back to his car and retrieved the weapon, Salt Lake City Police said. No one has been arrested, but those involved have been identified by investigators. Police did not release their names or say what the argument was about but said it did not appear to be related to the game or the tournament, according to a statement Monday. U.S. Youth Soccer officials said they were saddened by the traumatic experience but proud of staff and volunteers who helped defuse the situation. The team associated with the people involved was expelled from the tournament, the organization said. Additional sanctions are possible.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state on Tuesday became the latest to sue some of the country’s top fossil fuel companies by alleging they misled the public about the impact their products have on climate change. The state wants the companies to tell consumers that the use of fossil fuel products harms the environment, Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan said after the lawsuit was filed in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington. The warnings could be similar to those noting the danger of tobacco products or food products that include nutritional and calorie information, he said. Donovan, speaking outside the Chittenden County courthouse in downtown Burlington where the lawsuit was filed, said officials are not trying to prevent the companies from selling their products in the state, and residents will continue to be able to use fossil fuels. “What we are saying is that Vermonters have the right to know,” Donovan said. “Give Vermonters accurate information. Put a label on the product, and let Vermonters decide.” The suit names ExxonMobil Corp., Shell Oil Co., Sunoco LP, CITGO Petroleum Corp. and other corporations. In a Tuesday email, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the suit was baseless and without merit. Citgo declined to comment on pending litigation. The other two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Five people who recently traveled to the state from Afghanistan have been diagnosed with measles, health officials said Tuesday. The cases are being reported four days after the U.S. halted inbound flights of Afghan evacuees following the discovery of a few cases of measles among new arrivals. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release that the people were part of the U.S. government’s emergency evacuation efforts from Afghanistan, which recently came under Taliban rule. State health officials did not offer specifics Tuesday regarding where the people who are infected are located. But they said they’re working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed in three parts of the state. Those places include Dulles International Airport, where some refugees flew into the U.S., and other parts of northern Virginia. Health officials are also working to notify people potentially exposed at an unidentified Richmond hospital and at Fort Pickett, an Army National Guard base southwest of Richmond that is providing temporary housing to recently arrived evacuees. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat. Most Americans are vaccinated against it as children.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted to move some of the $15 million in savings related to police officer departures to community-based programs. The police department will keep about $10 illion for technology projects and other expenses, while about $5 million will be invested elsewhere in what Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda described as a “hybrid approach.” The plan will partially address commitments the council made in 2020 to decrease the police department’s budget during 2021, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-1, with Councilmember Kshama Sawant calling for the department to keep less money. The council’s midyear budget legislation somewhat jibes with a plan proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan over the summer, though a Durkan-backed request that some money be allocated for officer hiring and retention incentives was rejected. In November, Durkan and the council decreased the police department’s budget by tens of millions of dollars for 2021, reversing a growth trend. But they also cleared the department to hire new officers. The council is also no longer pursuing layoffs of officers with records of misconduct, citing legal barriers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The numbers of new cases and people hospitalized for the coronavirus in the state both smashed records yet again Monday as Gov. Jim Justice scolded residents who continue to balk at receiving COVID-19 vaccines. At least 40% of the state’s population above age 12 has not been fully inoculated, according to health data. Efforts by Justice and others to urge residents to do so have resulted in only minimal improvement in recent weeks. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Justice said at a news conference. The Republican governor has himself balked at issuing either a vaccination mandate or new mask requirements. An earlier indoor masking rule was lifted in June as the number of cases dropped. At the news conference, Justice introduced Linda Lanier, who said her adult son, Joe Goodnite, refused to get vaccinated and contracted COVID-19 on a family vacation. He’s been in a Charleston hospital for more than six weeks and remains on a ventilator. Lanier’s son “listened to all the negative and false accusations about vaccination,” she said. “Being in the medical field myself, I tried to convince him. However, it didn’t work. He listened to his friends. He listened to social media. And he just listened to what I call the garbage that’s out there.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge’s decision to release from a mental health facility a woman who helped stab her sixth grade classmate to please online horror character Slender Man has left the victim’s family nervous and afraid, a spokesman said Tuesday. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren on Friday ordered 19-year-old Anissa Weier released from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh, ruling that she’s no longer a threat and that conditions on her release should protect both her and the community. Weier has spent nearly four years at the facility. Bohren had scheduled her release for Monday. Officials with the state Department of Health Services, which oversees Winnebago, have repeatedly refused to so much as acknowledge Weier was a patient out of privacy concerns. Steve Lyons, a spokesman for victim Payton Leutner’s family, said Tuesday that they’re disappointed with Bohren’s decision and that Weier should have served more time. “We’re just nervous that she’s going to be out,” Lyons said. “We’re nervous about the potential of what could happen.” Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Leutner suffered 19 wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The leader of the state Senate expects Gov. Mark Gordon to call a special legislation session on vaccine mandates, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Senate President Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, said the effort to repel President Joe Biden’s controversial executive order last week – which says large companies must require workers either to get a COVID-19 vaccination or to undergo regular coronavirus testing – seemed likely to result in a special session, though the Republican governor would have to request the move. But it’s unlikely legislators could block a presidential order, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/15"}]}

It also ended with a special surprise: an audio message from the couple's then-1-year-old son Archie.\n\n\"Happy... New...Year!\" he piped, followed by much giggling and cheering from his parents.\n\nSince then, the couple welcomed their second child, daughter Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in June 2021.

Or what do I think of women that are ambitious?\" she questioned.\n\nThe tennis star, who recently announced her retirement in a personal essay for Vogue's September issue, recalled reading an article describing a male athlete as \"passionate\" while simultaneously saying Williams had a \"meltdown.\" \"I was like, wait, how do I have a meltdown? But this guy's passionate.\"\n\n\"There's obviously a double standard,\" Williams said, adding that she actually finds tennis \"more exciting\" when players get emotional due to the rigid culture around the game. \"So, if (male tennis players) want to have these attitudes, I'm all for it. Just don't say I can't either.\"\n\nAmong other double standards, she shared that since having her daughter Olympia, 4, she's always asked how she maintains \"mom/work balance.\" \"My husband (Alexis Ohanian), he talks about this all the time.

Luckily, her son was not in the room and the fire was quickly extinguished, she said.\n\nFeeling pressure to keep to their rigorous schedule, the couple dutifully appeared at their next official engagement, Meghan said.\n\n\"I said, 'This doesn't make any sense,'\" she told Williams. \"I was like, 'Can you just tell people what happened?' The focus ends up being on how it looks instead of how it feels.\"\n\nThe South Africa tour in September and October 2019, which was largely a success, was heavily covered by the world media at the time but the nursery fire incident was not reported.\n\n\"And part of the humanizing and the breaking through of these labels and these archetypes and these boxes that we’re put into is having some understanding on the human moments behind the scenes that people might not have any awareness of and to give each other a break,\" Meghan said.\n\nBuckingham Palace:Duchess Meghan bullying investigation findings to remain private\n\nSerena Williams talks excitement for retirement\n\nWilliams added that as a \"perfectionist\" herself and a longtime tennis player, giving herself a break from tennis was something she \"struggled with.\" It wasn't until consulting several people, including Prince Harry who tried \"to knock some sense into me,\" that she made the decision to retire.\n\nDespite the hesitancy, she told Meghan: \"I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait to wake up one day and literally never have to worry about performing on such a high level and competing.\"\n\n\"Tennis was chosen for me and I loved that choice and I couldn't have made a better choice, right? So I was really happy that that happened. But now, for the first time in my entire life, I'm choosing to do something,\" Williams reflected. \"I'm making a different choice. One, to stop doing what I love and two, hopefully, have more kids and to focus on other things.\"\n\nIn case you missed it:Sports icons Serena Williams, Simone Biles, Venus Williams among USA TODAY Women of the Century\n\nMeghan wrapped up the podcast by saying ambitious women tend to be targeted under the guise that they \"somehow deserve whatever gets thrown at you however disproportionate or unfair it may be.\"\n\n\"Sometimes ambition in women also seems to suggest that you aren't afraid of anything. But as you heard Serena say, of course, fears still exist. … And maybe that's the point.

Here's why it ...", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden is considering canceling some federal student loan debt, suggesting a once pie-in-the-sky idea is closer than ever to becoming reality.\n\nBut while some Democrats argue that the President should immediately erase large amounts of student loan debt for 43 million Americans with the stroke of his pen, the implications of such a significant policy move are complicated.\n\nThere are upsides and downsides.\n\nOn the one hand, student debt cancellation could deliver financial relief to millions of Americans, helping them buy their first homes, start businesses or save for retirement -- all investments that may take a back seat to pay off student debt. Loan forgiveness could also help narrow the racial wealth gap, some experts say.\n\nBut broad student loan forgiveness would also shift the cost -- likely hundreds of billions of dollars -- to taxpayers, including those who chose not to go to college or already paid for their education. Loan cancellation could also add to inflation while doing nothing to address the root of the problem: college affordability.\n\n\"This is a pretty complex issue,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told MSNBC's Symone Sanders earlier this month when she pressed him on why broad student debt cancellation hasn't happened yet.\n\nBorrowers currently hold $1.6 trillion in outstanding federal student loan debt, more than Americans owe in either credit card or auto loan debt. About 54% of borrowers with outstanding student loan debt owed less than $20,000 as of March 2021, according to the College Board . About 45% of the outstanding debt was held by the 10% of borrowers owing $80,000 or more.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, thousands of borrowers had their Social Security checks Compared with other kinds of debt, it's extremely difficult to discharge student loans in bankruptcy. Prior to the pandemic, thousands of borrowers had their Social Security checks garnished because their student loans were in default.\n\nafter August 31, and the White House has indicated that the President will decide whether to cancel some student debt by then -- just months before the midterm elections. Federal student loan payments and interest accrual have been frozen since March 2020 due to a pandemic-related pause that Biden has extended several times. Payments are set to resume after August 31, and the White House has indicated that the President will decide whether to cancel some student debt by then -- just months before the midterm elections.\n\nStudent loan debt cancellation won't lower the cost of college\n\nA one-time cancellation of federal student loan debt would do nothing to bring down the cost of college for future borrowers or those who already paid for their degrees.\n\n\"Forgiving debt does not affect college affordability at all,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIn fact, it might even drive up the cost of college, he said. If prospective students have reason to believe that a future president may cancel their debt, they may be more willing to borrow more money -- and colleges, in turn, may decide to charge more for tuition and fees.\n\n\"It creates this moral hazard and sets up an expectation that debt may be forgiven in the future,\" Holtz-Eakin said.\n\nBiden has acknowledged that college affordability is a problem and called for making community college free -- but that move would require an act of Congress. The proposal was cut from the Biden-supported Build Back Better bill, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate.\n\nAn economic boost? Or higher costs for all?\n\nA lot of borrowers say that having less student debt hanging over their heads could help ease the pain of rising inflation.\n\nIf Biden cancels some student loan debt, it's true that some borrowers will owe less money on a monthly basis and in turn, have more money in their pockets. But more consumer spending could add fuel to an already overheated economy.\n\n\"It's a situation where what's good for individuals is not necessarily good for society,\" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, where she focuses on the economics of higher education.\n\n\"In reality, it probably wouldn't move the needle drastically in either direction. But the downside for cancellation got a bit worse since we entered this inflationary period,\" Akers added.\n\nOne reason the economic impact may be modest is because borrowers generally pay back their student loans over time. They wouldn't receive a lump sum of money if some of their debt is canceled. They would instead be required to pay less money each month toward their student loan payments.\n\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that canceling all $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt would increase the inflation rate by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points over 12 months. But Biden has suggested he would cancel report from the nonpartisanCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that canceling all $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt would increase the inflation rate by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points over 12 months. But Biden has suggested he would cancel less than $50,000 per borrower.\n\nThe cost of canceling student loan debt would add to the deficit -- transferring the cost from borrowers to all taxpayers. The White House has suggested Biden is considering canceling $10,000 per borrower, but excluding those who earn more than $125,000 a year. Under those parameters, student loan debt cancellation would cost at least $230 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\n\nHelping poorer households as well as high-earners\n\nThere are certainly many low-income Americans who are struggling to pay off their student loan debt. But it's not easy to target loan forgiveness to those who need it the most and exclude borrowers with higher salaries.\n\nMany economists argue that canceling student loan debt would disproportionately benefit higher-wealth households, like those of doctors and lawyers, because those borrowers tend to have more student debt after attending graduate school.\n\nAn income threshold that cuts off borrowers who earn more than $125,000 a year could help make sure a bigger proportion of the relief goes to low-income borrowers.\n\nMatthew Chingos, vice president of education data and policy at the Urban Institute, has estimated the share of forgiven debt by income group if Biden canceled $10,000 of student loan debt for borrowers earning less than $125,000 a year.\n\nAbout 16% of the canceled dollars would go to the poorest households earning less than $25,000 a year.\n\nRoughly one-quarter of the relief dollars would go to those earning between $26,000 and $44,000, and another quarter to those earning between $71,000 and $122,000.\n\nOne-third of the relief would go to households with total incomes between $45,000 and $70,000 a year.\n\nStudent debt cancellation would help close the racial wealth gap, experts say, because Black students are more likely to take on student debt, borrow larger amounts and take longer paying them off than their White peers.\n\nstudent debt.\" \"Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues. The student loan system mirrors many of the inequalities that plague American society and widens the racial wealth gap,\" wrote dozens of Democratic lawmakers in a March letter to Biden urging him to cancel \"a meaningful amount ofstudent debt.\"\n\nBut the impact on the racial wealth gap could be muted by the fact that there are also fewer Black college students than White college students. Chingos' model found that 62% of the canceled student loan dollars would go to White borrowers while 25% would go to Black borrowers if Biden canceled up to $10,000 for those earning less than $125,000 a year.\n\nPlus, most Americans don't have student loan debt at all. Roughly 80% of households below the $125,000 threshold don't have student loan debt and would not see a benefit if Biden takes new action, according to Chingos.\n\nSome loan forgiveness programs already exist, but they don't always work\n\nThere are already federal student loan repayment programs that exist to help borrowers who are struggling to make their payments or were victims of for-profit college fraud.\n\nMost federal student loan borrowers are eligible for loan repayment plans that tie their monthly payment amount to their income and family size, known as income-driven repayment plans. There are a variety of plans, but generally they cap payments at 10% of a borrower's discretionary income. After 20 or 25 years of payment, depending on the specific plan, the remaining student loan debt is forgiven.\n\nalways work the way they should. A recent Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness. But the programs are messy and don'talways work the way they should. A recent Government Accountability report found that few people have qualified for forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan. The Department of Education had approved forgiveness for a total of 157 loans as of June 1, 2021.Meanwhile about 7,700 loans in repayment may have already been eligible for forgiveness.\n\nThe federal government also offers a student loan forgiveness plan for public sector workers who make 10 years of qualifying monthly payments. But the program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, has also had problems that prevented people from qualifying.\n\nand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that are The Biden administration has made changes to both the income-driven repayment programand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that are bringing millions of borrowers closer to debt forgiveness.\n\nThere is also a government forgiveness program for borrowers who enrolled at schools that shut down while they were enrolled or fell short of delivering the education the institutions promised. The Biden administration has been chipping away at a backlog of forgiveness claims filed under this program, known as borrower defense to repayment.\n\nAltogether, as of June 1, the Department of Education has approved $25 billion in student loan debt forgiveness for 1.3 million borrowers under Biden.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/25/rnc-live-melanie-trump-mike-pompeo-speak-second-night-republican-convention/3433672001/", "title": "Republicans sought to strike a hopeful tone on Day 2 of their ...", "text": "Refresh often for updates throughout Day 2 of the RNC.\n\nWASHINGTON – Republicans sought to strike a more hopeful tone during the second night of their national convention Tuesday, featuring members of President Donald Trump’s family – including first lady Melania Trump – and placing an emphasis on the less controversial aspects of the president’s first term.\n\n“It has been inspiring to see what the people of our great nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most fragile,” the first lady said in an address from the Rose Garden where the president joined a live audience watching and -- in a rare occurrence during the pandemic -- applauding her remarks.\n\nThe first lady focused much of her speech on what she described as the American spirit to overcome crisis, from COVID-19 to natural disasters. She steered widely clear of both policy arguments and political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,” Melania Trump said in address that also touched on mental health and addiction with a weight few others have given to those issues.\n\nThat softer approach was set before the first lady walked onto the podium in the historic garden that was recently renovated under her direction. Unlike the convention’s opening night, most speakers Tuesday focused their fire on Biden’s policies – particularly his desire to roll back Trump’s tax cuts on high earners -- rather than on dark premonitions of “socialism” or the “destruction” of suburbs.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” said Larry Kudlow, one of Trump’s top economic advisers. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nSpeakers sought to tout the progress made confronting the economic crisis without offering proposals for dealing with the current dramatic increase in unemployment. Many featured speakers, including the first lady, discussed the coronavirus in broad terms, arguing that the president “would not rest” until a vaccine or therapy had approved to treat the illness.\n\nLara Brown, director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, noted that some Republicans spoke as if COVID-19 was already in the past and the economy had already recovered.\n\n\"Both of those descriptions about the present moment and near future seem disconnected from the reality that most Americans are experiencing,\" Brown said.\n\nThe Republican convention started Tuesday with a recognition of the high-profile shooting in Wisconsin of Jacob Blake, a Black man shot in the back by police in an incident that has aired for days on cable news. The convention’s opening prayer, offered by a Las Vegas minister, called for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake.\n\nTrump himself made two remarkable appearances: Formally pardoning Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas man who helps ex-prisoners re-enter society, and leading a naturalization ceremony for five new U.S. citizens. Both highly unusual events were criticized by Democrats as a questionable use of presidential authority during a political event.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wondered if the president delayed the pardon so that it would coincide with the convention.\n\n\"The main thing I find troubling is that Trump knew Jon Ponder, knew his story, knew of his good works, and didn’t get around to pardoning him until today,\" she said.\n\nBut they also set a far different message than Trump’s usual rhetoric on immigration: Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, was barely raised at all. Neither were his efforts to limit legal immigration through unilateral changes to asylum and visa programs.\n\n\"Congratulations,” Trump told the group in a video the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. “Great going.\"\n\nConvention speakers touted the tax cut law Trump signed in 2017, the recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. The convention featured a video noting the number of women Trump had appointed to top jobs in the White House, including the current and previous two White House press secretaries.\n\nThe night was not entirely devoid of harsh criticism of Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, in particular, used her remarks to attack the former vice president's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine, revisiting an argument she raised during the president’s impeachment defense.\n\n“If they want to make this election a choice between who's been saving America and who's been swindling America, bring it on,” Bondi said.\n\nNor did the convention’s second night go off without a hitch: Organizers had to pull a speaker from the lineup after she promoted anti-Semitic, QAnon conspiracy theory on Twitter. Mary Ann Mendoza -- an advocate for stricter immigration policies whose son was killed in accident by a driver who was an undocumented immigrant – was dropped shortly before the event got underway.\n\nBut for the most part, the convention’s second night appeared to stick to a different script.\n\n“Donald is a husband that supports me in all that I do,” first lady Melania Trump said. “We will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years.”\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nMelania Trump confident the nation will recover from COVID-19\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump headlined the second night of the GOP convention with a keynote address from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, opening her remarks by acknowledging the coronavirus pandemic and the devastation and anxiety it has caused across the country.\n\n“I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy COVID-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,” she said. “My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.”\n\n“I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know. You are not alone,” she continued. “My husband's administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.”\n\nAre the trees gone?:Melania Trump did not remove cherry trees, historic roses from Rose Garden\n\nTrump’s homage to women’s suffrage and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as part of the campaign’s wider effort to appeal to the crucial female voting bloc. A recent ABC/Washington Post poll found that Joe Biden leads Trump 56% to 40% in support among women.\n\n\"I reflected on the impact of women's voices in our nation's story and how proud I will be to cast my vote again for Donald, this November,\" she said. \"We must make sure that women are heard. And that American Dream continues to thrive.\"\n\nThe first lady’s address is her biggest prime-time speech since the 2016 GOP convention, where she was accused of plagiarism after portions of her speech closely resembled parts of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama.\n\nA Trump Organization employee later issued a statement taking responsibility for the similarities.\n\nTrump has mostly stayed out of the political spotlight as her husband has campaigned in recent months but used the address to highlight her favorite moments as the first lady.\n\nIt also gave her a chance to showcase the renovations she oversaw of the Rose Garden though not without controversy. Delivering her speech from the Rose Garden, part of the official White House, raised ethical questions about whether it blurred the line between the government and the president’s re-election campaign.\n\nShe also opened up about her experience of coming to the U.S. from Slovenia, even as her husband has sought to curb legal and illegal immigration.\n\nTrump said becoming a citizen was \"one of the proudest moments in my life, because with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream.\"\n\n\"As an immigrant, and a very independent woman. I understand what a privilege is that we have,\" she said. \"There are no words to describe how honored humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your first lady.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nKentucky attorney general: Biden ‘a backwards thinker’\n\nKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron slammed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “a backwards thinker” and suggested President Donald Trump could live up to the “mandate” of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nCameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, blasted Biden for saying during a radio interview earlier this year that African Americans who don’t vote for him “ain’t black” and warning in 2012 that Republicans would put Blacks “back in chains.”\n\n“Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world craving forward-looking leadership,” Cameron said. “There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements.”\n\nCameron, a rising star in the Republican Party, has come under criticism from activists who want his office to speed up its investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her Louisville apartment in March. Her death has sparked protests across the country.\n\nIn his remarks at the Republican National Convention, Cameron criticized anarchists who “mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police officers and innocent bystanders.”\n\nRepublicans “recognize those who earnestly strive for peace, justice, and equality,” he said.\n\nCameron, who was raised just a few miles from Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky, said the nation’s 16th president – who is also the first Republican president – believed “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present … and we must rise to the occasion.”\n\n“I believe President Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his party’s radicals and his own failed record,” he said\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nPompeo touts Trump’s 'bold' foreign policy in remarks from abroad\n\nSpeaking from Israel while traveling on official government business, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump has “led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to secure peace and “keep us safe and our freedoms intact.”\n\n“It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked,” Pompeo said in defense of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy that has alienated traditional U.S. allies, even as Trump courted foreign adversaries. He recorded his remarks during a stop in Jerusalem, part of a four-country diplomatic mission in the region.\n\nThe State Department said Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity, not as America’s chief diplomat. But Pompeo talked about policy decisions.\n\nThe successes he touted included holding China accountable “for covering up the China virus,” killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, lowering the temperature with North Korea, exiting the “disastrous nuclear deal with Iran” and moving the U.S. Embassy to “this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.”\n\nIn 2017, Trump delivered on a campaign promise to break with decades of U.S. foreign policy and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That decision, among other pro-Israel policies, has helped bolster Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a pivotal constituency for the GOP.\n\nPompeo’s remarks broke diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity.\n\nBefore he spoke, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo’s decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\"\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nEric and Tiffany Trump step into the spotlight to tout father's record\n\nEric Trump, Trump’s third eldest son, joined a list of relatives who spoke or are slated to speak at the Republican convention. He used his remarks to tick off a list of his father’s accomplishments and echoed his brother, Donald Trump Jr., in painting a Joe Biden presidency as “the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left.”\n\n“He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business,” Trump said.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, a call by some on the left to shift public resources from law enforcement agencies to social programs and public safety alternatives. Biden has said he does not back defunding police and instead called for additional funding for local police forces.\n\nEric Trump rounded out his remarks by speaking directly to his father, saying he missed “working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight.”\n\nTiffany Trump, the fourth of the president’s five children and perhaps the least visible, offered a stinging critique of the media, technology companies and even the nation’s education system for promoting what she described as “groupthink” that stands in opposition to the president.\n\n“People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for may and are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” said Tiffany Trump, who graduated from Georgetown Law this year. “If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another.”\n\nTrump’s family was heavily represented on the second night of the convention at a difficult time: The president’s brother died of an undisclosed illness Aug. 15. President Trump has also been forced to contend with a critical book written by his niece, Mary Trump, and recorded audio of sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ripping him for “phoniness” and “lying.”\n\nThere was little indication of that strife on Tuesday, though.\n\nTiffany Trump implored Americans to see “beyond the façade – the masks – that so many other politicians employ” and she urged voters to “make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.”\n\n— John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian\n\nPolice officer touts Trump efforts on opioids\n\nMarrying two key criminal justice messages often addressed by President Donald Trump, the Republican convention on Tuesday turned to an Albuquerque police officer who adopted the baby of a woman addicted to heroin.\n\nRyan Holets recalled an incident in 2017 in which he approached a pregnant woman preparing to inject heroin. The woman confessed she seeking a family who would adopt her baby.\n\n\"God showed me exactly what I had to do,\" Holets said. \"Without hesitation, I told her that my family would adopt her baby.\"\n\nThe story hit on several important themes for Trump: First, the president has frequently touted the importance of police in communities, even as some departments have come under criticism for high-profile deadly interactions with Black citizens.\n\nThe story also spoke to an issue Trump has frequently discussed: The growth of opioid addiction in the U.S. Trump has signed several executive orders on the issue, and the administration has worked to reduce the number of opioids prescribed by doctors.\n\n\"I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction,\" Holets said. \"That’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nNunez: Trump will oppose socialism\n\nFlorida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, the first Latina in that post in state history, urged voters to support President Donald Trump to put “America first” in economic policy and for religious freedom.\n\n“Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country,” said Nunez, whose parents fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia, and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China and Nicaragua.”\n\nShe said Trump would support law enforcement. She said he would fight to provide the best quality education by preserving school choice.\n\n“Americans have a choice,” Nunez said. “We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose the path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American Dream for future generations.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nIowa governor: Trump ‘had our back’ during floods, storms\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds credits President Donald Trump with helping her state recover from devastating floods and storms.\n\nWhen 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri last year, Trump approved their request for federal aid in record time – just two days, Reynolds said.\n\nAnd when a storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops just two weeks ago, Trump approved the state’s disaster aid request in less than 24 hours, she said.\n\nTrump “had our back,” said Reynolds, a Republican and Trump supporter.\n\n“The president cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly,” she said.\n\nIowa is expected to be a key battleground state in November’s election. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 9.5 percentage points. But polls show him in a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden this year. Trump leads Biden by just 1.7 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nRepublican lawyer references Trump impeachment - to attack Joe Biden\n\nSurprisingly, President Donald Trump's impeachment came up at the Republican convention on Tuesday.\n\nNot surprisingly, a Republican lawyer used it to attack Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped Trump with his impeachment defense, used her speech to attack Joe Biden's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\"Joe Biden says he'll build back better,\" Bondi said at one point. \"Yeah ... build the Biden's Back Better.\"\n\nBondi provided no evidence that Hunter Biden's business activity in Ukraine was illegal, or that Biden himself acted improperly.\n\nDemocrats quickly pointed out that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine into investigating Biden, despite the lack of evidence, and for threatening to withhold military aid if it did not follow through.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a former Republican and now a Trump opponent, tweeted that Bondi is \"ethically challenged,\" and \"lying about the Biden Family and repeating the talking points of Russian Intelligence Services.\"\n\nBondi has a close relationship with Trump, first as a long-time confidant from her days as attorney general and later as one of the lawyers who defended the president during the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year.\n\nShe also faced heavy criticism in 2013 when a Trump foundation sent her campaign a $25,000 check around the time her office decided not to join a New York state probe of consumer complaints against Trump University. Bondi has repeatedly said the donation had nothing to do with a decision made by independent investigators in her office not to pursue the investigation.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC speaker pulled from lineup after boosting QAnon-tied conspiracy\n\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory made its way to the Republican National Convention Tuesday.\n\nShortly before the second night of programming began, Mary Ann Mendoza was pulled from the RNC lineup after earlier in the day retweeting an anti-Semitic Twitter thread with ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nMendoza tweeted “Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” linking to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that claimed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish family from Germany, created a plan to terrorize “goyim” — non-Jewish people — by having \"the goyim destroy each other\" and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.”\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nKudlow: Trump’s actions spurred coronavirus recovery\n\nLarry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the U.S. economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic thanks to “a great bipartisan rescue” led by President Donald Trump.\n\nA tax hike would disrupt the recovery, he warned.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans, has had a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy since March. A mind-boggling 57.3 million workers have filed for unemployment over the past 22 weeks. Just two weeks ago, some 1.1 million Americans filed first-time applications for unemployment, the Labor Department said, signaling that the recovery will remain volatile.\n\nBut Kudlow struck an upbeat tone in his remarks to the Republican National Convention.\n\n“Americans are going back to work,” Kudlow said. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.”\n\nLooking ahead, the Trump administration is planning more tax cuts and regulatory relief for small businesses, Kudlow said.\n\n“Our economic choice is very clear,” Kudlow said. “Do you want economic health prosperity opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation recession and pessimism? There can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years.”\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTaxes become theme of RNC\n\nRepublicans are working hard during the second night of the Republican convention to drive home a message about Democrat Joe Biden, arguing his administration would quickly increase taxes – as soon as Day 1.\n\n\"You're coming out of a pandemic, and he wants to raise taxes?\" asked Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers. \"That's crazy.\"\n\nIt was a theme that was repeatedly raised throughout the evening.\n\nJohn Peterson, owner a metal company, said Biden is \"ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that Trump is the candidate to support for voters \"who want lower taxes.\"\n\nBiden has vowed to repeal the Trump tax cuts approved early in his presidency, but for top earners -- those earning over more than $400,000 – as well as corporations. If elected, Biden would need buy in from Congress to roll back the tax cuts, a move unlikely to take place on his first day.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nControversial former Planned Parenthood employee appeals to anti-abortion voters\n\nAbby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate known for turning against Planned Parenthood after working as the director of a clinic, touted President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion agenda.\n\n“For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,” Johnson said on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson, author of the memoir “Unplanned” that was also adapted into a film, told the story of witnessing an abortion that changed her views on the issue while wearing a “1972” pin to symbolize the year before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal.\n\n“I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life,” she said.\n\nShe praised Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would be sympathetic to pro-life ideals and for withdrawing federal funds from clinics that conduct abortion referrals.\n\n“Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans,” Johnson said. “And this election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we’ve ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action.”\n\nJohnson has come under fire for a number of controversial opinions. Vice reported Tuesday that she said in a video she thinks it is “smart” for police to be “on more high alert” when interacting with her biracial son than with her white sons because “statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.”\n\nRecent tweets by Johnson also show she supports head-of-household voting rights, which would only allow one representative from a household to cast their vote rather than each adult citizen. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said.\n\nIn a tweet ahead of her RNC appearance on Tuesday, Johnson accused abortion rights activists of being scared of her speech and “scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message.”\n\n—Jeanine Santucci\n\nChallenging the media\n\nNicholas Sandmann, the student at the center of a media storm, urged voters Tuesday to support President Donald Trump because he refuses to allow news coverage “to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.”\n\n“I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism,” Sandmann, 18, said before putting on a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.”\n\nThe news coverage that focused on Sandmann unfolded in January 2019, when the northern Kentucky teenager stared at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who played a drum. A viral video of the moment played repeatedly on cable news and was reported in newspapers.\n\nSandmann, then a student at Covington Catholic High School, was attending a March for Life. Phillips was attending an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann said unfair coverage of the event changed his life forever in one moment without reporters asking for his side of the story or investigating Phillips’ motives.\n\n“What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,” Sandmann said of his portrayal as a smirking boy in a red hat because of Trump’s opposition to abortion. “My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode.”\n\nSandmann sued CNN for $275 million by claiming the network defamed him, and the Washington Post. He reached undisclosed settlements in January.\n\nIn March, Sandmann sued five more outlets, including Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY.\n\n“I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void,” Sandmann said. “Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I would not be cancelled.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBilly Graham’s granddaughter praises Trump as a 'fierce advocate' for religious groups\n\nCissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of evangelist Franklin Graham and granddaughter of legendary preacher Billy Graham, hailed President Donald Trump as a “fierce advocate in the White House” for people of faith who stands up for religious freedoms that were “under attack” during the Obama administration.\n\n“Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,” she said. “But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack.”\n\nThe president is trying to shore up support among conservative Christians and white evangelicals who helped him secure his 2016 victory, but his approval rating among religious groups has slipped in recent months. A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 59% of white evangelicals say they “very strongly” approve of Trump, down eight points from April. But the survey also found that 82% would still vote for him if the election were held in July.\n\nGraham Lynch, whose father is scheduled to speak on Thursday, said Trump-appointed judges who “respect the First Amendment,” supported religious beliefs in court and “ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs.”\n\nShe added there was “no room for people of faith” in the Biden administration, though the former vice president has frequently talked about how his Catholic faith has helped him survive the death of his first wife and their daughter in a 1972 car crash, as well as the death of his son in 2015.\n\n“Whether you’re a baker, a florist or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar,” she said. “Because the radical left’s god is government power.”\n\nGraham Lynch’s comments came hours after Jerushah Duford, another granddaughter of Billy Graham, penned a searing rebuke of Trump and her uncle Franklin Graham for his support of the president. Duford, who wrote in USA TODAY that her faith and church have become “a laughing stock,” called on evangelical Christian women to speak out against Trump’s actions.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nRNC turns to a more hopeful message\n\nBreaking with the dire messaging of \"socialism\" and \"Loch Ness\" monsters that dominated the first night of the RNC, Republicans embraced a softer tone Tuesday -- at least in the early minutes -- ahead of first lady Melania Trump's address.\n\n\"He has followed through on his promises,\" asserted Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce.\n\n\"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said dairy farmer Chris Peterson.\n\nIn the most notable example of the shift, Trump appeared himself briefly in a taped appearance from the White House and signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\nThe event drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention, but it nevertheless underscored more of a focus on the president's accomplishments rather than on what Republicans see as Biden's failures.\n\n\"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" Ponder said. \"I have been given a second chance.\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFishing for votes\n\nJason Joyce, an eighth-generation lobsterman from Swan’s Island, Maine, said he didn't support President Donald Trump in 2016 because he expected the president \"to flip flop on his campaign promises.\"\n\nBut Joyce strongly supports Trump’s reelection this year because the president listened to fishermen’s views and adopted them. In contrast, Joyce characterized the Obama administration and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as ignoring industry views.\n\n“As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice,” Joyce said. “But if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.”\n\nTrump has promoted Maine lobster since a June 5 roundtable in Bangor. He reversed the Obama administration order that closed off 5,000 square miles of ocean to fishing for what is called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.\n\n“This action was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,” Trump said.\n\nThe monument is about 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod – too far for Mainers to reach. And Obama grandfathered lobster and crab harvesting for seven years in the 2016 order, so those fisheries haven't been affected yet. But the decision still rankled fishermen.\n\n“Although Maine's lobstermen don't fish there, Obama's executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the fisheries counsels’ input,” Joyce said. “President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input, and he supports a process that seeks and respects fishermen's views.”\n\nLobster is a valuable seafood market, with 133 million pounds landed in 2017 worth nearly $600 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Mainers landed more than 80% of the U.S. lobster catch that year.\n\nBut trade wars have damaged the industry. The European Union agreed Friday to lift tariffs of 8% on U.S. lobster and 20% on lobster products, which had hurt trade compared to Canadian lobster that faced no tariffs.\n\nChina also imposed a tariff on U.S. lobster in 2018 that now stands at least at 35%. Trump asked the Agriculture Department for monthly reports on the China tariff starting Aug. 15.\n\nJoyce said he strongly supported Trump's reelection.\n\n\"When he sees something isn't right, he’s fearless in fixing it,\" Joyce said. \"He listens to working people.\"\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nRand Paul: 'If you hate war ... support President Trump'\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican known for his anti-interventionist view of global affairs, praised Trump’s approach to “end war rather than start one,\" trying to portray a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden when it comes to making the planet safer.\n\n\"I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home,\" said Paul, who has often joined the president in calling for the wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\"If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term.\"\n\nTrump has touted his unconventional strategy on foreign policy, including efforts to build bridges with authoritarian figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea despot Kim Jong-Un.\n\nHe’s also drawn bipartisan fire for trying to undermine the NATO alliance and for pulling troops out of Syria, a move that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis.\n\nPaul, who did not appear at the RNC in 2016, had some unkind words for Trump four years ago when both were running for the White House. He called the billionaire businessman \"a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.\" Trump in turn criticized Paul's looks and called him \"a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.\"\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nPrayers for Jacob Blake during RNC\n\nNorma Urrabazo from the International Church of Las Vegas opened Tuesday’s events with a prayer for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake, the Wisconsin man who was shot multiple times in the back by police officers Sunday while he was leaning into an SUV.\n\n“I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine and let’s prayer in agreement,” Urrabazo said. “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.”\n\nIn addition to prayer for Blake and his family, Urrabazo asked for protection for those who have “put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nRNC courts Native American vote for Trump\n\nNative Americans will make up a tiny slice of the electorate in November, but they could have an outsized influence on the election where it counts: Several battleground states.\n\nSo it was no surprise the RNC opened its second night with Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation – a territory that covers portions of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n“Our people have never been invited into the American Dream,” said Lizer, who appeared with Trump at an event in Phoenix this year. “We’ve for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators that were part of a broken system that ignored us.\n\n“That is, until President Trump took office,” he said.\n\nLizer pointed specifically to billions of dollars in economic stimulus to help tribal communities address COVID-19.\n\nTrump has had a complicated relationship with Native Americans. He repeated use of the word “Pocahontas” to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been offensive to some.\n\nMore recently, Trump slammed the decision to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team, a word that is a slur used to describe Native Americans.\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million people identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, or in combination with at least one other race.\n\nThe vast majority vote Democratic, except in states where energy is a large focus of the regional economy, such as Alaska, North Dakota or Oklahoma. Native Americans could also be a factor in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\n—John Fritze and Ledyard King\n\nTrump's surprises: Swearing in new citizens, pardoning a prison activist\n\nPresident Donald Trump used a \"surprise appearance\" at Tuesday's Republican political convention to swear in five new U.S. citizens.\n\nWhile some analysts questioned Trump taking official actions at a political convention, the president supervised the swearing-in of five new U.S. citizens born in Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Ghana and Sudan.\n\n\"Congratulations – great going,\" Trump told the group in a video that the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast.\n\nNoting that one of the new American citizens has a degree in psychology, Trump said: \"In other words, she can figure me out.\"\n\nWhile Trump used the ceremony to tout the virtues of legal immigration, Democrats said his crackdowns at the border are designed to keep out any person of color.\n\nCritics said Trump should not make such political use of the presidency at a political convention.\n\nBen Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted that the GOP meeting \"is infused with the illegal and unethical use of everything from the White House to the presidential pardon power.\"\n\nBefore the immigration ceremony, Trump signed a federal pardon for Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society.\n\n\"Jon's life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,\" Trump said\n\nThe state of Nevada had already granted clemency to Ponder, a convicted bank robber.\n\nTrump, who has made criminal justice reform a part of his agenda, praised Ponder's work with ex-prisoners, he did not mention voting rights. The president has opposed restoring voting rights for felons, and criticized governors who support the idea.\n\nIn thanking Trump for his federal pardon, Ponder said \"we live in a nation of second chances.\"\n\nRichard Beasley, a retired FBI agent who once arrested Ponder but is now a friend, also appeared in the video, saying, \"I'm so proud of Jon with his life's turnaround, and for all the lives that he's helped to change.\"\n\nCritics said Trump's use of the presidency violates at least the spirit of the Hatch Act that forbids government employees engaging political activity. (Presidents, however, are exempt from the law.)\n\n\"The Hatch Act is a law designed to separate politics from public service,\" tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Those lines are being erased tonight.\"\n\nIn his latest break from political tradition, Trump is making appearances every night at the Republican convention.\n\nThat will include his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\nLocation: The White House.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nRNC viewership fell 29% from 2016\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday averaged 15.9 million television viewers – 29% less than viewership four years ago and 15% less than the first night of last week’s Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt closely resembles the 27% nosedive in viewers for night 1 of the DNC convention, which averaged 18.7 million viewers. The opening night of the 2016 RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio drew about 22.5 million viewers.\n\nThe Nielsen figures, reported by Variety and the Los Angeles Times, combine viewership on the three main networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and leading cable new networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nFox News set the pace Monday leading with 7.1 million viewers followed by CNN’s 2 million viewers; ABC, nearly 2 million; NBC, 1.7 million; MSNBC, 1,6 million; and CBS, 1.5 million.\n\nFacing challenges of a global pandemic, both conventions ditched arenas and live audiences in favor of many recorded speeches and prepackaged videos. Democrats pieced together four nights of two-hour television shows while several Republican speakers shared the same stage at Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. while President Donald Trump was featured in multiple videos shot in the White House.\n\nAlthough last week’s DNC viewership was down significantly, the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden touted a record 10.2 million digital viewers, totaling 28.9 million viewers overall when combined with television viewership.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nMelania Trump big draw of RNC's second night\n\nOn its second night, the Republican National Convention will get personal.\n\nThe virtual lineup for Tuesday includes first lady Melania Trump and two of the president's children – Eric and Tiffany – along with a series of business people, advocates for Republican causes and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nMelania Trump, rarely seen campaigning with the president, will be the big draw of the evening. The first lady will speak in prime time from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, a project she supervised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself is also expected to show up during the online convention Tuesday. He plans to appear every night this week, leading up to his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night, also at the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDems push economic counter program during RNC\n\nThe battle over who gets credit for the pre-COVID economic recovery has become a defining issue of the conventions as well as this year's presidential election. Not surprisingly, Democrats argued Tuesday that Joe Biden deserves much of the credit.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, speaking as part of the Biden campaign's RNC counter-programming, said it was the Obama-Biden administration that led the country out of the worst economic downturn in generations. Trump, she said, drove that progress into the ground through his trade wars and haphazard pandemic response.\n\n“Donald Trump has severely worsened our country’s economy,” Whitmer said. “Workers and families cannot afford four more of years of that.”\n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that the recovery under Obama, who signed a major economic stimulus in 2009, was one of the slowest in the nation's history. While unemployment and market indicators were improving under Obama, they note those numbers took off at a faster rate once Trump was in the White House.\n\nThe debate is important because both candidates are positioning themselves as best able to help the nation recover from the economic catastrophe caused by COVID-19.\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited figures about how 1.5 million fewer jobs were created during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared to the final three years of the Obama administration. Booker also slammed Trump's tax cut bill as benefiting the rich while racking up enormous federal budget deficits.\n\n“We know people all across New Jersey are hurting and need some relief,” Booker said. “Working families know that the president isn’t looking out for them.”\n\n– Bart Jansen and John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/16/spaceport-america-police-cat-superdome-plan-news-around-states/39968663/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: The city is looking for a new slogan, and it won’t be “A little different.” The north Alabama community of 55,000 people is trying to come up with a new branding tagline, and a Birmingham-based consulting firm suggested it use “A little different.” City leaders liked the idea. Council member Kristi Hill says it seemed modern. But the Decatur Daily reports the public reaction was so negative that leaders voted this week for the company to try again. Hill says the town isn’t ready for something as edgy as “A little different.” Decatur is on the Tennessee River, and it has long been called the “River City.” Council member Chuck Ard says residents need to speak up if they don’t want to lose that identity.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Country musician Zac Brown has lost a bid to limit snoopers on his private property in the state, the latest case in which the desires of the wealthy or celebrity for privacy have been at odds with public access. The lead singer for the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning Southern rock group that bears his name had sought to remove easements allowing access along his property, but the bid was rejected by a planning commission on the Kenai Peninsula, south of Anchorage, KSRM-AM reports. “I’m not interested in the public coming up to my home, people snooping, walking up to my windows,” Brown told the commission. “I’ve had to sell property for this reason.” Brown’s log home in Homer overlooks scenic Kachemak Bay. Homer, with a population of about 5,600, is frequented by fishermen and free spirits and bills itself as the “Halibut Capital of the World.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A court has scheduled arguments Oct. 23 in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s appeal of a ruling that refused to erase his criminal record after he was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Arpaio was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court for disobeying a court order to stop his immigration patrols. A judge who had refused to expunge the conviction says that pardons don’t erase convictions or the facts of cases and that Arpaio’s clemency only mooted his possible punishments. Arpaio’s lawyers argued their client was deprived of his opportunity to appeal his conviction because the pardon came before he was sentenced and final judgment was entered, so the conviction must be erased. A special prosecutor says Arpaio relinquished his right to appeal his conviction when he accepted the pardon.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A plant-based food producer has asked a federal court to temporarily stop the state from enforcing a law that bans labeling vegetarian and vegan products as meat and advertising them as such while litigation is underway. Hood River, Oregon-based Tofurky Co. told courts Wednesday that complying with the law would have a “severe detrimental impact” because of the cost to change marketing and packaging. It’s not clear if the law has been enforced since taking effect three weeks ago. The law’s authors say it’s designed to protect consumers. Tofurky claims the lawsuit restricts commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. A spokeswoman says Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is reviewing the motion to determine next steps.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 500 animals including lions, tigers, alligators and wolves will get new homes after officials announced a long-struggling Southern California sanctuary is shutting down. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of directors of the Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest voted this week to close after 43 years. The Department of Fish and Wildlife says it’s collaborating with the facility and animal welfare organizations across the country to relocate 470 exotic animals, including 42 chimpanzees. Officials with the 160-acre Wildlife Waystation were unavailable for comment. But a Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman said the sanctuary suffered extensive damage in a 2017 wildfire and during severe flooding earlier this year. The Times says for two decades, authorities have been scrutinizing the waystation for alleged environmental and animal-safety violations.\n\nColorado\n\nBethune: The state has set a new hail record, though the exact size of the hail that fell near the Kansas border is still being determined. Officials with the National Weather Service and the Colorado State University Climate Center measured a hail stone that fell at a home north of Bethune on Tuesday and was preserved in a freezer at 4.8 inches in diameter. That’s about the size of a softball, although it’s more oblong. Measurements taken by the family that recovered the hail stone after it was safe to go outside show it was initially a little bigger. The Climate Center says it will consider all information to determine a final measurement. The previous hail record for Colorado is 4.5 inches. The national record is 8 inches – the size of a volleyball – set in 2010 in South Dakota.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A pilot program in several cities aims to divert people accused of low-level offenses and who are homeless or have mental illness from the criminal justice system and get them treatment instead. The Early Screening and Intervention Initiative asks specially trained prosecutors to screen for low-level offenses – such as fourth-degree larceny or second-degree assault – and work with counselors in the courthouse to get the defendants treatment. If the person completes treatment, prosecutors then can decide not to pursue the case. The Division of Criminal Justice says the goal is to reduce the burden on the courts and find more appropriate, and often cheaper, outcomes for people struggling with addiction or other mental health issues in a state where police often file charges directly rather than working through prosecutors.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Big Brother wants to keep a closer eye on big rigs in the state. Gov. John Carney was expected to sign legislation Thursday that authorizes state and local governments to install vehicle height monitoring systems. The systems use camera technology to record images of motor vehicles whose heights exceed specified size limits. The legislation is aimed at making sure tractor-trailer drivers aren’t using roads on which trucks are prohibited. State transportation officials will have one year from enactment of the legislation to identify roads as potential candidates for the monitoring systems and conduct an analysis to determine the appropriateness of each location. State officials could then install monitoring systems on state-maintained roads, and local governments could adopt ordinances authorizing monitoring systems on locally maintained roads after notifying the public.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has defended its plan to house unaccompanied migrant children in the city. The Washington Post reports DHHS says unaccompanied minors were apprehended alone, unlike migrant children separated from their families. It says its wards have beds and access to meals, legal services, games and classes. It says it awarded Dynamic Service Solutions a $20.5 million contract this month to operate a 200-bed D.C. facility for kids ages 12 to 17. The Maryland-based contractor has applied for a permit to open the shelter and posted jobs for people to work with “unaccompanied alien” children there. City officials have denounced the shelter, and Councilwoman Brianne K. Nadeau may propose emergency legislation to limit the number of youths allowed at shelters.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The federal government is proposing to strip the tiny Key deer of its endangered species status despite what environmentalists say are continuing threats to the animal due to development in the Florida Keys, its only known habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says its studies show there is no more significant threat to the deer and has set a public forum Aug. 22 in the Keys on removing the deer from the Endangered Species List. Environmental groups say stripping the deer of endangered status would leave it at the mercy of further development. The deer, which grows to about 30 inches at the shoulder, have become a tourist attraction. Its numbers are estimated at about 600, up from as low as a couple dozen in the 1950s.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge overseeing a challenge to the state’s outdated voting system said that after years of inaction in the face of warnings about vulnerabilities, state officials have finally taken a solid step in the right direction. But she foreshadowed a looming fight over the state’s new system, writing that “it may be ‘like ‘deja vu all over again.’ ” U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg’s order Thursday prohibits the state from using its antiquated paperless touchscreen machines and election management system beyond this year. She also said the state must be ready to use hand-marked paper ballots if its new system isn’t in place for the March 24 presidential primary election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: University of Hawaii students protesting the construction of a $1.4 billion telescope are expected to have class options allowing them to remain on the mountain, a report says. The plan to start construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island has been thwarted for weeks by a group of Native Hawaiian activists who say the construction will further desecrate a mountain that already has more than a dozen observatories. A list of more than 200 courses students can take either online or via distance learning has become available, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The majority of the remote classes for student demonstrators are offered through UH-Manoa, while others are offered by the UH-Hilo and Hawaii Community College. Course topics include Hawaiian religion, mythology, culture and language, Pacific Island literature, business, creative writing, and philosophy.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are looking into how the Trump administration’s move to weaken how it applies the Endangered Species Act could affect federally protected species in the Gem State. Scott Pugrud, Idaho Office of Species Conservation administrator, says his office is reviewing the regulatory changes. “We’ve got all our staff kind of digging in and seeing what they are and what the impacts will be on Idaho,” Pugrud told the Idaho Press. Idaho is home to six endangered and 13 threatened species, including sockeye salmon and Kootenai River white sturgeon. Threatened species include Canada lynx and grizzly bears. Idaho’s Office of Species Conservation was established in 2000, one year after the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list. The bird bounced back with a successful captive-breeding effort led by the Peregrine Fund, now based in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to the Illinois State Fair can see a plot of newly legalized industrial hemp growing. The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that 100 industrial hemp and eight CBD plants were planted next to the U of I Master Gardner’s land on 8th Street. Hemp production was legalized last summer, and officials in April made applications available to would-be growers. Agriculture Director John Sullivan says the two varieties of the cash crop are easy to differentiate. CBD plants need to branch out to produce buds for oils. Industrial strains are planted close together so they will grow tall with long, straight stems for production of fiber or hurd – dense, absorbent material. An agriculture official will be giving presentations at the hemp plot daily from 1 to 3 p.m.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The cemetery where 1930s gangster John Dillinger is buried is objecting to his body’s planned exhumation as part of a television documentary. Crown Hill Cemetery said in a statement Wednesday that it objects to the exhumation in part because it’s concerned that “the complex and commercial nature of this exhumation could cause disruption to the peaceful tranquility of the Cemetery” and people visiting loved ones’ graves. Dillinger was fatally shot by FBI agents in Chicago in 1934. WXIN-TV reports that Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, sued the cemetery Wednesday, arguing it should allow him and his family to exhume Dillinger’s remains for a forensic examination to determine if it’s in fact Dillinger’s body. That exhumation would be part of a Dillinger documentary for The History Channel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A full weekend of international food and music is in store next month, with the 15th annual World Food & Music Festival set to be held at Western Gateway Park in downtown Des Moines on Sept.20-22. More than 50 food vendors representing more than 25 countries and culinary regions will be featured at one of the city’s premier food and music events. The festival will be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free. The band Vertical Horizon, which had a No. 1 Billboard spot in 2000 for “Everything You Want,” will headline the festival Saturday.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City, Kansas, improperly listened to recorded communications between inmates and their defense attorneys and willfully violated court orders during an independent investigation of the systemic practice, a judge said in a ruling that could upend hundreds of federal convictions and sentences. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in a 188-page decision handed down late Tuesday also held the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas in contempt of court, saying she would impose monetary sanctions against the government as punishment for violating orders to preserve evidence and turn over documents to the court-appointed special master investigating prosecutors’ use of video and phone recordings at the privately run Corrections Corporation of America detention center in Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new state law requires public schools to display the motto “In God We Trust,” and one school district has responded with framed copies of a $1 bill. Fayette Superintendent Manny Caulk told the Lexington Herald-Leader on Wednesday that all schools in the district have been provided the framed copy to display. Parent Brittany Pike posted a message on Facebook saying she was pleased to see the back of the dollar bill framed at an elementary school last week and said her children “don’t feel awkward or excluded for not believing in any God.” Republican state Rep. Brandon Reed of Hodgenville filed the legislation that created the new law. He says he’s disappointed to see schools “spend time searching for silly loopholes,” noting the law passed with broad support.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The iconic Superdome, home to the Saints football team and a symbol of the city’s revival after Hurricane Katrina, will undergo a $450 million facelift, under a financing plan approved Thursday that is aimed at keeping the NFL team in Louisiana for decades. The 44-year-old domed stadium, which has hosted seven Super Bowls, will see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved. Construction is expected to take four years, working around football and other event schedules, but will be completed before the Superdome hosts its next Super Bowl in 2024, says Doug Thornton, a New Orleans-based executive for SMG, which manages the facility.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: Pop artist Robert Indiana had $13 million in the bank even as his house sank into disrepair before his death, with pigeons living in the roof, water damaging books, rotting wood and the stench of cat urine, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Documents filed by Indiana’s estate allege that aide Jamie Thomas was not a selfless caregiver, contending he “improperly lined his pockets,” claimed as gifts more than 100 of Indiana’s works, and allowed Indiana to live in “squalor and filth.” Indiana, whose “LOVE” series is instantly recognizable worldwide, died at his home on Vinalhaven Island on May 19, 2018. He was 89. The documents, filed in Superior Court, accuse Thomas of violating his duties to Indiana. In the end, it took more than 1,000 hours of cleanup and the disposal of 8.6 tons of ruined, waterlogged paper to get the home in order, the documents say.\n\nMaryland\n\nOwings Mills: An African American school principal says he was degraded by a white Baltimore County police officer while he and his son watched an arrest. The Baltimore Sun reports police are investigating the claim made by Patterson High School Principal Vance Benton, who says he and his 15-year-old son were observing an arrest last month when the officer began “baiting” him, making belittling comments, such as asking Benton if he could read and insinuating that Benton’s son would be arrested someday. His letter to county officials says he’d never experienced such “degradation, disrespect and humiliation.” He wrote that innocent lives are in jeopardy from this kind of racial bias. Police Chief Melissa Hyatt says they’re taking the complaint seriously. The department denied the paper’s request for the officer’s body camera recording.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: An increase in the number of great white sharks around Cape Cod has forced a longtime charity swim race to be rerouted. The Cape Cod Times reports that Cape Cod National Seashore officials have denied a permit for the 32nd annual Swim for Life & Paddler Flotilla. The race was originally slated to start off Long Point Beach in Provincetown Harbor. Agency superintendent Brian Carlstrom says starting the race there isn’t in line with the organization’s “shark-smart” principles. Carlstrom says the agency made the decision out of an abundance of caution. The rerouted Sept. 7 race will be closer to shore. The state’s first fatal shark attack in 80 years occurred last September off Cape Cod. Another man was seriously injured in an attack last August.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of the state’s inmates who are eligible for resentencing following a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on so-called juvenile lifers still are waiting to learn their fate. An analysis found nearly 200 inmates, or about 55% of those eligible, haven’t gotten new sentencing hearings. As of early July, 86 of the state’s 354 juvenile lifers have been released. “We are not resolving cases at the rate that you would hope, given that the United States Supreme Court said these sentences should be rare,” says Tina Olson, an attorney with the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office. Her office is representing roughly two-thirds of the state’s cases. Prosecutors defend the process and say they’re thoughtfully weighing each case.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A conservative law center is suing state Attorney General Keith Ellison, alleging that a lawyer working in his office on climate issues is an improper political plant. Attorney Pete Surdo is working for Ellison under a fellowship with the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s School of Law. Minnesota Public Radio reports the center was funded by billionaire donor Michael Bloomberg to address climate issues. Doug Seaton of the Upper Midwest Law Center says the connection is improper and unethical. He also says the arrangement violates a state law requiring all lawyers in the attorney general’s office to be state-paid. But Ellison says the arrangement is legal. He says Minnesotans expect an attorney general who enforces environmental law, and he’s happy to accept the help.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s largest city will stop curbside recycling collections by month’s end. Public Works Director Bob Miller says the program is indefinitely suspended, in part because China’s demand for recycled materials has fallen. Officials say more than 300 cities nationwide have stopped curbside collections. Jackson is referring residents to private collectors and says it’s seeking drop-off alternatives. Residents will get at least one more curbside collection before Sept. 1. Miller says while the city has been spending $1.15 million annually for curbside pickup, less than a third of residents participate. He says Jackson will consider restarting curbside recycling when the marketplace “reorganizes itself.” Waste Management, which collects Jackson’s garbage and recycling, argues the city can’t cut recycling from its contract. Jackson officials disagree and haven’t paid for months.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Department of Natural Resources and Missouri Central Railroad have more time to negotiate over a proposed 144-mile bike trail that would stretch across the state. Missouri State Parks said Wednesday that the U.S. Surface Transportation Board approved a request for another 133 days to negotiate an agreement for the Rock Island Trail, which would run from Windsor in western Missouri to Beaufort in eastern Missouri. The trail would run along a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad path. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports Mike Sunderland, of the Missouri State Parks, says the extension will allow the Missouri State Park Foundation to develop potential partnerships to support the project.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal land agency has purchased a large area of land from a state conservation organization, increasing the amount of public ownership in the region. The Missoulian reports the Bureau of Land Management signed paperwork this week to purchase 20 square miles in the Lower Blackfoot River corridor just east of Missoula. Federal officials say money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to purchase the land, with future plans to acquire additional areas by the end of 2020. Officials say the goal is to reach 94 square miles in the Blackfoot drainage and return formerly public lands that were given away decades ago. Officials say any additional purchases will have to go through a federal review process.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say hunters may begin donating deer to the Hunters Helping the Hungry program beginning Sept. 1 at 11 processor locations around the state. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says two more will accept deer for the program starting Nov. 1 and Nov. 16. Hunters pay no processing costs for the processing. The program is funded solely by tax-deductible contributions. Ground venison is distributed by charitable organizations to Nebraskans in need. Processors accept only whole deer in good condition to ensure a good yield of pure ground venison. Learn more about the program and how to support it at the commission website, or contact program coordinator Teresa Lombard at 402 471-5430 or teresa.lombard@nebraska.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Federal Highway Administration has issued an environmental excellence award to state wildlife and transportation officials for creating wildlife safety crossings on special highway overpasses in northeast Nevada. The award recognizes nine safety crossings installed on Interstate 80 in Elko County between Wendover and Wells and U.S. Highway 93 north of Wells to reduce potentially dangerous vehicle-animal collisions. The overpasses are covered with native soil and vegetation to replicate the natural environment and encourage crossing by mule deer, elk and other animals. Nevada’s departments of transportation and wildlife worked together to identify the most critical deer migration and roadway-crossing points, including GPS collars to track the migratory movements of hundreds of deer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The police department says it will install surveillance cameras despite a judge’s warning they could violate privacy laws. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire sued the city of Manchester over the cameras in June. A judge’s preliminary order Tuesday said reviewing the footage and using it to identify someone is illegal, though installing the cameras isn’t. Manchester police want to install the three cameras near City Hall because of complaints about crime, panhandling and loitering. A live feed would be transmitted to the dispatch office. While not intended for traffic, the cameras on Elm Street could capture a driver’s identifying information, such as their face or license plate, which the ACLU says is against the law.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge has put a temporary hold on a new state law allowing terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs. Judge Paul Innes of Superior Court in Mercer County signed the temporary order Wednesday blocking the law and set a hearing for October. Brought by Dr. Yosef Glassman, the suit seeking to block the law argues it violates constitutional rights as well as common law barring suicide. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh state allowing the practice. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. New Jersey’s law went into effect this month. Murphy said at an unrelated event Thursday that he will fight the suit, and the attorney general will put out guidance.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nUpham: Virgin Galactic has unveiled its digs at Spaceport America. The once-empty hangar in a remote spot in the New Mexico desert that anchors the taxpayer-financed launch and landing facility has been transformed into a custom-tailored headquarters where Virgin Galactic will run its commercial flight operations. Two levels within the spaceport include mission control, a preparation area for pilots, and a lounge for paying customers and their friends and families, with each element of the fit and finish paying homage to either the desert landscape that surrounds the futuristic outpost or the promise of traveling to the edge of space. Billionaire Richard Branson, who is behind Virgin Galactic, and former Gov. Bill Richardson first pitched the plan for the spaceport nearly 15 years ago, but there were plenty of construction delays and cost overruns.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: Visitors may now get a look at two rare leopard cubs at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon announced that the little Amur leopards made their public debut Wednesday at the Syracuse zoo. The male and female cubs gradually ventured out from private quarters into their exhibit. It’s a temporary one while the zoo works toward a new, more complex $400,000 outdoor space for the leopard family. The cubs were born June 19 to parents Tria and Rafferty. The cubs don’t yet have names. The zoo plans a vote soon. Amur leopards are considered critically endangered. They are found in far eastern Russia, where an estimated 84 remain in the wild, up from about 30 in 2012. About 250 Amur leopards live under human care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMocksville: The police department is evicting its pet cat named Sgt. Butters, and some residents are mounting a campaign to bring him back. The Winston-Salem Journal reports the Mocksville Police Department’s resident feline needed a new home after concerns were raised about a pregnant woman who worked in the building and said she couldn’t be around cats. Officers had rescued the cat last year after it was seen hanging around the department. A Save Sarge Butters petition on Change.org was nearing its goal late Thursday. Sgt. Butters has been credited with helping to restore the department’s tarnished image after a jury awarded $4.1 million in damages to three former officers who said two town officials fired them in 2011 for reporting allegations of corruptions to state officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota State Fair officials have decided against holding a tobacco-free day at next year’s event. The state Health Department and Bismarck tobacco prevention coalition had asked the fair board to designate Family-Military Day as smoke-free at the 2020 event. Fair Board President Gary Knell says it would be difficult to make a fairgrounds ban work. The board decided to continue following state guidelines regarding tobacco in public places. State law prohibits smoking in enclosed public spaces oe within 20 feet of doors, windows or ventilation systems of public buildings. The Minot Daily News reports Knell says even though the board denied a tobacco-free day, advocacy groups could set up booths at the fair to encourage people to go tobacco-free on the grounds.\n\nOhio\n\nPortsmouth: A man is crediting his dog for saving him after the man suffered a bad fall. WSAZ-TV reports Jimmy Hale fell off a flood wall in Portsmouth last week while walking Taco. Hale ended up passing out after falling 15 feet and didn’t wake up until the next day. Hale says he screamed for help, but no one answered. That’s when Hale says he heard a lawnmower and then footsteps. Portsmouth city worker Mark Puckett says he only noticed Hale because of Taco, who stayed on the wall until someone showed up. Hale was flown to St. Mary’s Medical Center, where he was still recovering Wednesday from pelvic and wrist injuries. Hale was reunited with Taco in the hospital Wednesday, and the two had an emotional reunion.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin has agreed to provide access to propriety research and other data to researchers at Oklahoma State University to help them find causes and treatments for drug addiction. Purdue Pharma announced the agreement Thursday in a joint statement with OSU. Purdue said it will provide OSU’s new National Center for Wellness & Recovery access to “research molecules and certain associated data” that will help with research into addiction. The company and its controlling family, the Sacklers, agreed earlier this year to pay Oklahoma $270 million to settle allegations they helped create the nation’s deadly opioid crisis with their aggressive marketing campaign. That money is being used to establish the research center at OSU.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The governor has signed a bill requiring eggs produced by commercial farms to eventually be cage-free. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Gov. Kate Brown approved the new law mandating all eggs produced or sold in Oregon must come from cage-free hens by 2024. The measure signed Monday applies to commercial farms with 3,000 or more chickens. The state requirements will give about 4 million birds added space and perches. The Humane Society of the United States called the law a “monumental win for hens confined in tiny cages in the egg industry.” Oregon joins a handful of other states with similar laws including California, Washington and Massachusetts. The newspaper cites reports that say cage-free laws provide an improvement for chickens, but most remain held in small spaces and cages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMechanicsburg: A man is accused of putting people at risk by placing unidentified substances into consumer product packaging and returning the items to retail stores. Police on Wednesday charged 58-year-old Robert Keith Burns of Mechanicsburg with reckless endangerment, theft by deception and criminal mischief through tampering. The arrest affidavit says Burns wouldn’t tell investigators what materials were put inside of packaging for beauty aids and medication returned to stores or recovered from his home. He’s in jail, unable to post $50,000 bail. Burns doesn’t have a lawyer listed in court records. Authorities seized packaging, glue, jars and white cream from a search of Burns’ home last week. Police have said they are trying to determine what substances were used and haven’t fielded any reports of people being sickened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The state’s attorney general and state police launched investigations Thursday after a truck drove through a group protesting federal immigration policies at a detention center, which has since placed an employee on leave. At least two people were injured, one seriously, Wednesday night outside the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, according to the Jewish youth movement Never Again Action. The center is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A video posted by the group on social media shows a black pickup that protesters say was operated by a uniformed corrections officer driving up to an entrance blocked by demonstrators. The vehicle stops before again moving forward. Protesters surround the truck, screaming and chanting: “The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBeaufort: A former commercial helicopter pilot has become the first female Marine to pilot the F-35, a next-generation joint strike fighter aircraft. The Island Packet reports Capt. Anneliese Satz completed her fighter jet training this summer at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort. Satz trained in Mississippi, Florida and Texas over the past four years before arriving in Beaufort last summer to train in the F-35B Lightning II. A station statement says Satz’s aircraft is a supersonic stealth vessel designed to operate from short-field bases and near front-line combat zones. The statement says the 29-year-old Satz credits her history as a commercial helicopter pilot as what prepared her for a career in military aviation. She’s now headed to Iwakuni, Japan, to join a unit called the Green Knights.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBrandon: The state Department of Health and city officials are trying to assure residents the quality of the city’s drinking water is just fine. Concerns were raised after a doctored water quality report surfaced online that indicated unsafe radium levels. The report had redacted information about the company that conducted the testing, as well as the identity of the customer who hired the water quality assessment done. The state and city investigated and found the report posted online July 28 had been altered. The city of Brandon held a press conference Wednesday afternoon to address the issue and assure residents Brandon’s drinking water meets Environmental Protection Agency safety standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A local startup aims to use honey to help heal wounds, and Regional One Health is putting its unique product to the test. Apis is a dissolvable patch made of manuka honey from New Zealand and the structural protein collagen that protects wounds during the healing process. It’s the first product by SweetBio, a company with four full-time employees based out of the University of Memphis’ CommuniTech Research Park. SweetBio wants to figure out where exactly its product fits in the health care industry, a question Regional One’s health system is suited to answer thanks to the variety of patient scenarios it encounters. Regional Medical Center in Memphis, an acute-care hospital, is in that system. The partnership is the next step in Apis’ journey to becoming a commercial product, following its FDA clearance for wound management in May.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Area voters will be asked this fall to approve up to $3.5 billion in bonds to expand public transportation that supporters say could benefit more than a dozen communities. Metropolitan Transit Authority board members on Tuesday agreed to place the issue on the Nov. 5 ballot. The bonds would be repaid by future sales tax revenues. Federal money will also be sought for the anticipated $7.5 billion in projects that could extend three light rail lines, expand use of bus rapid transit in dedicated lanes and create high-occupancy vehicle lanes along most of Houston’s freeways. Houston-area voters in 1978 created METRO and approved a one-cent sales tax to support operations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah plans to spend about $925,000 to improve safety following the killing of a student track athlete on the Salt Lake City campus. University President Ruth Watkins had called for a task force to evaluate safety after 21-year-old Lauren McCluskey was gunned down in October by a man she briefly dated. The task force made two dozen recommendations, including improving building alarms, adding police patrol outside of night classes and hiring a chief security officer. The university is also rolling out a campus ride-hailing service. Students hired to be drivers will transport students and staff across campus. The university plans to have most of the security measures in place before classes start next week.\n\nVermont\n\nWilmington: A nonprofit created in response to Tropical Storm Irene is dissolving and donating its funds for local trail upgrades. The Wilmington Selectboard voted this week to accept more than $176,000 of remaining assets from the Wilmington Fund to be used for renovations of the Valley Trail system. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the money is meant to be used to enhance, upgrade and build the trail system with “family friendly” biking and hiking. The designated area spans about 5.6 miles between Wilmington and Dover. Town Manager Scott Tucker says the board’s next step is to plan the design for the trail system. He did not give a cost or exact time estimate for the project. Tucker says they hope to begin construction by next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The widows of two state troopers killed in a helicopter crash while monitoring a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville are suing the state and others, blaming their husbands’ deaths on a “maintenance nightmare.” Amanda Bates and Karen Cullen filed wrongful death lawsuits Monday against Virginia, the Secretariat of Public Safety and Homeland Security and state police. Berke M.M. Bates and H. Jay Cullen had been monitoring the “Unite the Right” rally Aug. 12, 2017, before their helicopter crashed. The lawsuits say the helicopter was a “maintenance nightmare” with a history of malfunctions. Federal transportation safety investigators expect to issue a final report on the crash next year. A preliminary report did not offer a likely cause. Spokeswomen for the defendants said they couldn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Newly leaked emails show conservative state Rep. Matt Shea has had close ties with a group in the state that trained children and young men for religious combat. The Spokesman-Review reports the emails were first revealed in The Guardian on Wednesday, while Shea’s ties with Team Rugged also showed up in a video on Shea’s public Facebook page. “The entire purpose behind Team Rugged is to provide patriotic and biblical training on war for young men,” a man identified as the group’s leader, Patrick Caughran, wrote in a 2016 email to Shea, R-Spokane Valley. “Everything about it is both politically incorrect and what would be considered shocking truth to most modern christians,” Caughran wrote. “There will be scenarios where every participant will have to fight against one of the most barbaric enemies that are invading our country, Muslims terrorists.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFort Gay: The town has received a grant that’s expected to help transform a lock house into a community historical site. The Herald-Dispatch reports the FOCUS WV Brownfields Grant check was presented last week to leaders in Fort Gay. The $5,000 grant will allow the town to get an environmental assessment, which is the first step in transforming the Lock Masters House at the Big Sandy Lock and Dam #3. The town hopes to turn the lock house into a welcome center and community museum. Leaders also want to add a public river walk. Construction of the dam was completed in 1897 but abandoned in 1925. Currently, the locks are mainly used by a few fishers, but Mayor Joetta Hatfield says she hopes the site attracts more anglers in the future.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused a paralyzed Democratic lawmaker of trying to sabotage a new national role for the Republican legislative leader by publicly seeking accommodations for his disability. This “does not seem like an accident to me,” Vos told a conservative radio show host Thursday. “Everything they do is political and trying to make the other side look bad.” Vos earlier this year rejected Rep. Jimmy Anderson’s request to be able to call into meetings he cannot attend because of his disability and to bar overnight floor sessions. Vos told WISN’s Jay Weber he believes the timing of Anderson’s public appeal was meant to undermine the announcement of Vos taking over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. But Democratic leaders made the request in February, and Anderson reached out to a reporter in May. Vos took over the new role 10 days after the story was published.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A new state park at a former launch command center for one of the world’s most powerful nuclear missiles has opened to the public this week. KGAB-AM reports the Quebec 1 Wyoming Historic Site north of Cheyenne opened for tours Tuesday. An official grand opening is set for this weekend. The former Peacekeeper missile site is located off Interstate 25 about 25 miles north of Cheyenne. Tourists will be able to go underground to the steel-reinforced concrete capsule. The site also features a museum. It’s estimated that the site will attract 50,000-60,000 visitors a year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/17/carbon-storage-commissioner-comeback-hand-recounts-news-around-states/50609615/", "title": "Carbon storage, commissioner comeback: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A project that’s been planned for more than a decade is nearing fruition, thanks to a $20 million federal grant. The Pedestrian Access and Redevelopment Corridor has been on hold for years because of a lack of funding, city officials said. Known unofficially as the skybridge, the PARC project will safely connect the downtown, Mill Creek and Lower Mill communities through greenways and a suspended pedestrian bridge, al.com reports. Those three areas are now separated by two major state and federal roads. The funding comes from the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. “We appreciate our partnership with the federal government and this grant, which will help us take Huntsville to the next level,” Mayor Tommy Battle said. Two other Alabama projects also received funding through similar grants. The town of Cordova received $5.2 million to improve deteriorating roadways, and the Northwest Alabama Council of Local Governments received $2 million for the Shoals Area Railroad Overpass in Colbert County. Shane Davis, Huntsville’s director of Urban & Economic Development, said the city’s skybridge project has been a goal since 2006.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Baby boomers who retired early as the COVID-19 pandemic set in are a key factor behind the state’s labor shortage, Alaska Public Media reports. State economist Dan Robinson told the news outlet that many older workers felt they could afford to take the leap early, while many others who left the labor market in recent years were in their 30s and stymied by a lack of child care. He told APM that while the pandemic was a factor, employers will just have to adjust to a new reality, as a lack of stable funding for government services means Alaska’s population loss trend is unlikely to abate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Proponents of three voter initiatives who each turned in hundreds of thousands of signatures last month to qualify them for the November ballot are trying to beat back legal challenges that could prevent them from going before voters. Two of the measures – one requiring disclosure of who is funding political campaigns and another rolling back or blocking efforts by Republicans to tighten voting rules – are being challenged by pro-business groups. They alleged that paid petition circulators made errors or omitted required information on their registrations with the secretary of state or petitions. The third measure, backed by a California-based employee union, would protect residents from predatory bill collection and raise the amount of assets shielded from bill collectors. It faces a similar challenge from a newly formed group funded by Arizona debt collection agencies, who say the description voters saw when they asked to sign was illegally misleading. Lawyers for challengers and the initiative proponents have spent the past two weeks in court, and three different Phoenix judges will decide who is correct. Whichever sides lose are are expected to appeal directly to the state Supreme Court.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the state’s use of the sedative midazolam in its lethal injections. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court judge’s ruling upholding Arkansas’ execution process. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker ruled in 2020 that the state’s use of midazolam in injections is constitutional and dismissed claims that less painful methods of execution are available. “With no scientific consensus and a paucity of reliable scientific evidence concerning the effect of large doses of midazolam on humans, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the prisoners failed to demonstrate that the Arkansas execution protocol is sure or very likely to cause severe pain,” the appeals panel said in its ruling. The ruling comes more than five years since Arkansas raced to execute eight inmates over 11 days before its batch of midazolam expired. The state ultimately put four men to death after courts halted the other four executions. It hasn’t executed any inmates since 2017 and has none scheduled. “It is past time that justice be carried out in these cases of defendants killing innocent people, and the Eighth Circuit’s decision reaffirms that Arkansas’ execution protocol is constitutional,” Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente psychologists, therapists, social workers and other mental health workers in Northern California began an open-ended strike Monday over staffing shortages that their union said have led patients to wait for months to get help. The National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents the workers, is negotiating a new contract with the Oakland-based health giant. It said the strike is to demand Kaiser hire more mental health workers to ease the burden put on the current staff. Kaiser Permanente said in a statement it has hired hundreds of new mental health workers, including 200 since January 2021, and pointed out the shortage in mental health care professionals is happening nationwide. It said that what’s at issue is the union’s demand to increase the time therapists spend on tasks other than seeing patients. The union is demanding 9 hours be allotted for administrative work, which would leave only 31 hours to see patients per week, the company said. It said it proposed increasing the time for administrative tasks from 6 to 7.2 hours, leaving 32.8 hours to see patients. Jeffrey Chen-Harding, a clinical social worker with Kaiser who was picketing Monday in San Francisco, said that what Kaiser calls an administrative task is actually important work directly related to patient care.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man had a rude awaking early Saturday morning when a roughly 400-pound bear flipped the lever doorknob to his home and rummaged through some dog food, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials said Monday. The homeowner, Ken Mauldin, grabbed a gun and shot the bear multiple times until it collapsed and died just after 2 a.m., said Rachael Gonzalez, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Nobody was injured, she said. Officers removed the animal from the house, located in the ski resort town of Steamboat Springs. The couple had a legal right to shoot the bear if they felt threatened, Gonzalez said. Colorado has roughly 12,000 bears, and break-ins aren’t uncommon in Rocky Mountain towns. People shooting and killing bears in self-defense, however, is rare, Gonzalez said. This particular male bear was not tagged, and the department does not know if it was involved in other break-ins, she said. “Steamboat, that area, they’ve been dealing with bears getting into homes all summer long,” Gonzalez said. “It’s not impossible that this bear learned the behavior from another bear.” Residents of Steamboat Springs are warned by the agency to lock doors and windows, secure their trash and recycling in bear-proof bins, and even take down bird feeders to prevent these kind of confrontations.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday cleared the way for a defamation lawsuit in Connecticut to proceed against Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The case was filed by relatives of some victims of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Jones has falsely claimed that the nation’s deadliest school shooting – which killed 20 students and six educators – was a hoax. Jones’ lawyer had sought to transfer the case to a federal bankruptcy court, rather than continue the case in Connecticut state court. That move brought the first day of jury selection to a sudden halt earlier this month. However, Monday’s ruling by Judge Julie Manning essentially allows the plaintiffs to continue the defamation lawsuit against just Jones as an individual, without Free Speech Systems, a company owned by Jones and a defendant in the Connecticut case. “The plaintiffs’ rights to have that process continue in the Connecticut Superior Court should not be disturbed,” Manning wrote in the decision, adding that the plaintiffs’ claims for damages were ready for trial. A Texas jury this month ordered Jones to pay $45.2 million in punitive damages to the parents of one of the children killed at Sandy Hook and another $4.1 million for the suffering he put them through by claiming for years that the shooting was a hoax.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A family is hoping for change after a 37-year-old man with an intellectual disability had his arm broken while he was taken into police custody earlier this year in an encounter advocates say could have gone differently if crisis intervention tactics were used. The man, who was violating a court order when he stood across the street from his aunt’s house in the New Castle area and is now facing charges, called police himself to report an argument with his aunt. The encounter ended with him being leg-swiped by an officer, which landed him on the ground with a broken arm that required surgery. New Castle County Police investigated the use of force officers exhibited that night and found that officer conduct was appropriate. But the encounter is one from which family and advocates say police can and should learn, as people with disabilities are more likely to be victims of police brutality. “Disability-related behaviors can be misunderstood by law enforcement officers who are trained to gain control and compliance on a scene but typically not trained to identify a disability or know how to interact or communicate with persons with disabilities,” said Carlean Ponder, director of disability rights and housing policy at The Arc, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for people with disabilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Homeland Security Department’s inspector general has refused congressional requests for documents and staff testimony about the erasure of Secret Service communication related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, angering top Democrats who accuse him of unlawfully obstructing their investigation. In an Aug. 8 letter disclosed Tuesday, Inspector General Joseph Cuffari told the leaders of the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees that his office will not comply with their requests for internal documents and sit-down interviews due to the ongoing criminal investigation into deleted Secret Service text messages. In response, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson sent a letter Tuesday demanding Cuffari turn over documents and make his staff available to lawmakers or risk facing a potential congressional subpoena “Your obstruction of the Committees’ investigations is unacceptable, and your justifications for this noncompliance appear to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of Congress’s authority and your duties as an Inspector General,” Maloney and Thompson wrote in the letter. “If you continue to refuse to comply with our requests, we will have no choice but to consider alternate measures to ensure your compliance,” they wrote.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Tracks used by the nation’s deadliest railroad will see added fencing to keep pedestrians away and safety improvements at crossings under a $25 million federal grant announced Monday. Brightline and government officials announced the grant as the privately owned passenger line continues to be plagued by deaths along its tracks between Miami and West Palm Beach. In the past two weeks, Brightline trains have killed three people – and 68 since the service began its first runs five years ago. That’s about one death for every 33,000 miles its trains travel, the worst fatality rate among the nation’s more than 800 railroads, according to an ongoing Associated Press analysis of Federal Railroad Administration data. The grant, part of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program, will cover safety features, including 33 miles of fencing at locations of frequent trespassing along with extensive crossing improvements at all 333 crossings along the corridor, which will eventually stretch from Miami to Orlando, Brightline President Patrick Goddard said. The company will also install an additional 150 warning signs and 170 more suicide crisis hotline signs “to better reach those who might be struggling with suicide,” Goddard said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he will spend up to $1.2 billion in federal COVID-19 aid on payments of $350 apiece to more than 3 million Georgians who benefit from Medicaid, subsidized child health insurance, food stamps or cash welfare assistance. The payments will start in September, said Katie Byrd, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move comes atop Kemp’s proposals last week to spend $2 billion in state surplus, split between property tax rebates and a second round of income tax rebates, if voters choose him for a second term in November over Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Those separate plans would require legislative approval next year. Monday’s announcement will put money in the hands of less affluent Georgians in the months before the nationally watched election in a narrowly contested swing state. Those are voters to whom Abrams has been tailoring her economic platform. She also backs another round of income tax rebates, like those Kemp already pushed though, but has been arguing that Georgia also needs to do more to invest in long-term expansions of health, education and small-business assistance to try to create a less unequal economy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new monk seal on Oahu’s North Shore has marine officials asking the public to give the mother and pup plenty of room, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The baby monk seal is the 14th birthed by mother Right Spot and her first on Oahu, having typically given birth on the island of Molokai, where she was born.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge says the Legislature can intervene in the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit targeting the state’s total abortion ban – but only to present evidence about emergency abortions performed in Medicaid-funded emergency rooms. In the written ruling handed down Saturday, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill said the Legislature’s interests are already well-represented by the Idaho Attorney General’s office and Gov. Brad Little, so there’s no legitimate reason to add another party to the lawsuit. The Justice Department sued Idaho last week over the state’s strict abortion ban, saying it would force doctors to violate the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law that requires anyone coming to a medical facility for emergency treatment to be stabilized and treated. Allowing a state legislature the right to intervene in every federal case without first proving a distinct need would allow a state to “turn into a nine-headed Hydra whenever it chooses,” Winmill said. The abortion ban was enacted in 2020 and set up as a “trigger law,” set to take effect Aug. 25 now that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. Idaho’s law criminalizes all abortions, and anyone who performs, attempts or assists with abortions can face two to five years in prison and lose their health care license. Physicians who perform abortions to save a patient’s life or in cases of rape or incest can use that information as a legal defense during the criminal trial.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A suburban Chicago police officer who fatally shot a hatchet-wielding man during a June traffic stop was justified in the deadly shooting, a prosecutor has determined. DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said Monday that Naperville police Officer Frank Tonkovich “reasonably believed” Edward Samaan, 28, of Naperville, was trying to kill either him or a driver Tonkovich had pulled over separately. Berlin said in a news release that Tonkovich’s actions were not just reasonable “but necessary in order to prevent great bodily harm or death to himself or the motorist he had stopped,” The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald reports. The officer had pulled over a car June 3 and was standing at that driver’s window when Samaan pulled his vehicle up nearby, exited it and charged Tonkovich with a hatchet in his hand, Berlin said. Tonkovich then shot at Samaan six times, hitting him five times. Samaan was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officer, a 22-year-veteran of the Naperville Police Department, was not injured.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Preliminary autopsy results released Monday for the three victims of a house explosion in a southern Indiana neighborhood show they died of blunt force trauma and compression asphyxia. A married couple who lived at the center of the Wednesday explosion in Evansville, 43-year-old Charles Hite and 37-year-old Martina Hite, both died of blunt force trauma to their chests, and 29-year-old neighbor Jessica Teague died of compression asphyxia, the Vanderburgh County Coroner’s Office said in a news release. Final autopsy reports and toxicology are pending, Chief Deputy Coroner David Anson said in the news release. The explosion injured a fourth person and damaged 39 homes, leaving 11 uninhabitable, authorities have said. A statement Monday by the Evansville Fire Department said the investigation is still in its early stages and likely will be lengthy. Suzanne Dabkowski, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said last week that the agency can’t speak to any possible causes of the explosion. Dabkowski said the ATF has explosive specialists and firearms investigators on site helping with the investigation. Evansville authorities have declined to speculate whether natural gas or another issue is responsible for the explosion.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The developer of a proposed $4.5 billion carbon capture pipeline must release the names of landowners who could be affected along its roughly 680-mile route, a district judge ruled. Summit Carbon Solutions, an Ames company that has proposed building a pipeline to transport liquefied carbon dioxide, failed to win a permanent injunction to keep secret the names of thousands of landowners it said could be in the pipeline’s path. Under state law, Summit was required to hold public meetings for landowners potentially affected by the pipeline project, and the company compiled a list with more than 10,000 names along the route. After the Iowa Utilities Board asked Summit to submit the names, the company asked state regulators to keep the list confidential. Summit also filed a petition with the court to keep the names secret. The Sierra Club of Iowa asked regulators to release the names under state’s open records law, a move state Consumer Advocate Jennifer Easler also supported. In November, the Iowa Utilities Board decided it would keep secret most of the names, saying property owners’ right to privacy outweighed the public’s interest. On Friday, Polk County District Judge David Nelmark said Summit had failed to show landowner information should be excluded from state public records law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to do a partial hand recount that won’t change the outcome of this month’s decisive vote in favor of abortion rights after abortion opponents charged almost $120,000 to credit cards Monday to cover the cost. The Kansas secretary of state’s office said the recount will occur in nine of the state’s 105 counties that account for more than half of the votes cast on the Aug. 2 abortion ballot question, including four of the state’s five most populous counties. Voters who want to keep the abortion rights allowed under the Kansas Constitution prevailed in eight of the nine counties. The recount request came Friday from Melissa Leavitt, an election conspiracy promoter from Colby in far western Kansas, but Mark Gietzen, a hard-right anti-abortion activist from Wichita who also promotes election conspiracies, pledged to help pay for the recount. Gietzen used a credit card to pay for all but $1,500 of the costs, which Leavitt will cover. Voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict abortion or ban it. There has been no evidence of significant problems with the election. Leavitt has an online fundraising effort that had received more than $41,000 in donations as of Monday evening.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Experts who are visiting disaster centers can help people whose heirlooms and keepsakes were damaged in recent flooding. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force experts may be able to help save photos, artwork, quilts, important documents and other items, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. The experts are visiting Clay County Community Center this week Friday through Sunday, Knott County Sportsplex Tuesday through Sunday, and Hazard Community College First Federal Center Wednesday through Sunday. FEMA said the experts will discuss how to handle, dry and clean the items, and they can provide information about personal safety during the restoration process. The Heritage Emergency National Task Force is co-sponsored by FEMA and the Smithsonian Institution. The task force was created to protect cultural heritage from damage from natural disasters and other emergencies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Law enforcement officers have ended a three-day peaceful protest by jail inmates who demanded improvements to living conditions, including quicker attention to requests for medical care. Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson issued a statement saying her deputies and state Department of Public Safety and Corrections officers entered a pod inside the Orleans Justice Center on Sunday night after inmates activated the sprinkler system and began to flood the area, WDSU-TV reports. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported inmates had barricaded a pod and refused food, water and medication. Hutson said deputies repeatedly offered to bring food and medication, and inmates refused to accept it. Inmates produced a list of desired changes that Hutson released Sunday. It included demands for more recreation time, a new washer and dryer, a second television, and the lifting of restrictions on how many books and photos inmates may receive each month. They also demanded proper medication and said they wanted sick calls to be treated seriously. An altercation at the jail in June resulted in the death of an inmate, and three stabbings recently occurred in the pod where the protest happened.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Federal regulators who want to enforce new vessel speed rules to help protect rare whales can expect some pushback from ship operators. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the new proposed rules, which are designed to protect the last remaining North Atlantic right whales, last month. The rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast and require more vessels to comply with the rules. The agency’s National Marine Fisheries Service is holding a series of informational meetings on the new rules. Some shipping and maritime groups said they have concerns the rules could make their jobs more difficult or less safe. The American Pilots’ Association is concerned the new rules would make operations more hazardous for pilot boats, said Clayton Diamond, executive director of the group. Pilot boats transport maritime pilots to and from larger ships, often in bad weather and at carefully calculated speeds, Diamond said. “We think that the NOAA/NMFS proposal to apply the speed restriction to pilot boats is unwise and unsafe,” Diamond said, adding that the group “strongly” supports protecting marine mammals. The agency isn’t commenting on industry concerns during the rulemaking process, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Maryland State Board of Elections voted Monday to file an emergency petition in court that seeks an earlier count of mail-in ballots for the general election in November. The board voted 4-0 to seek a legal remedy in hopes of speeding up the vote count for mail-in ballots, which have become much more popular with voters in the state. In a statement after the vote, the board said that the continued expansion of mail-in balloting and the inability of the local boards of elections to count mail-in ballots before Election Day could have significant implications. “It could leave local, statewide, and even federal contests without certified results until late December 2022 or early January 2023,” the board said. “Maryland is currently the only state in the union that forbids any kind of processing of mail-in ballots until after Election Day.” Currently, mail-in ballots can’t be counted until two days after Election Day. That caused delays in determining winners in the state’s primary last month. The state elections board certified the primary election Monday. Maryland’s primary was delayed by three weeks due to legal challenges involving congressional and legislative redistricting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michael Cox, a Boston police veteran who was brutally beaten by fellow officers while chasing a suspect and fought against efforts to cover up his assault, was sworn in Monday as commissioner of the police department. After taking the oath during a ceremony at City Hall Plaza, Cox thanked his family and friends who supported him through the incident that he said changed his life forever but does not define him. “I’ve worked to change policing since that incident occurred, and I will continue to do all I can to make sure that no Black or brown person or any individual, no matter their gender identity or race, is the victim of any kind of unconstitutional policing,” said Cox, who is Black. Mayor Michelle Wu called Cox a leader that Boston “deserves.” “I’m incredibly proud, grateful and inspired in the future for this city with Commissioner Michael Cox at the helm of the Boston Police Department,” she said. The Boston native most recently served as police chief in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Before taking that job in 2019, Cox served three decades in the Boston Police Department, where he took on the so-called blue wall of silence after he was attacked by colleagues who mistook him for a fleeing suspect whom he was trying to grab as he scaled a fence.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint Township: A name change for Flint Township will not appear on the fall ballot. Township trustees voted 4-2 Monday against placing the question on the ballot. The result would not have been binding, but there had been interest in getting the public’s opinion about a change to Oak Hills Township, MLive.com reports. Supporters of a name change say “Flint” carries baggage. The city is nearby. “In my business world, I have a really hard time selling Flint Township to outside folks,” said Winfield Cooper, a real estate broker. “I have to explain to them it’s not the city of Flint. I have to explain to them it’s not lead-contaminated water.” Flint’s water was contaminated in 2014-15 because state regulators didn’t require that water from the Flint River be treated to reduce corrosion. Changing the township name would cost at least $72,000 to change uniforms, vehicles and buildings at the fire and police departments. “It does nothing to change the township other than to spend money,” said resident Roger Powell, who opposed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Corrections has dropped its order that 18 prisoners who were released from prison to protect their health during the coronavirus pandemic report back to prison. The state had ordered the 18 to return to prison by Monday. But a Ramsey County judge has granted a temporary restraining order, saying reincarcerating the individuals could still be detrimental to their health. Assistant Attorney General Corinne Wright on Friday asked Judge Mark Ireland to cancel further hearings on the corrections order and said the state instead will make individual determinations for the 18 people remaining on conditional medical release, according to an email shared by American Civil Liberties Union Minnesota attorney Daniel Shulman, who sued on behalf of the inmates. “I applaud them for taking this step, and I hope that they will let these people remain on (medical release) where they should be,” Shulman told the Star Tribune. The 18 former prisoners were among the 158 people granted conditional medical release as COVID-19 swept through the prison population in Minnesota. Nearly 2,300 prisoners had applied for release.\n\nMississippi\n\nFlowood: For the second time in less than a month, an innocent bystander was killed during a police chase involving the same department. One person was killed Sunday during a police chase that began in Pearl. The chase ended when the vehicle that was being pursued crashed into a motorcycle, killing the driver. Public information officer Greg Flynn said a Pearl police officer attempted to make a traffic stop when a silver sedan took off. The officer pursued the vehicle into the neighboring city of Flowood, where police there joined the chase until it ended after the fleeing vehicle struck a motorcycle. Flynn said police later discovered the man was driving with a suspended license and had felony convictions at the federal and state levels. He is being charged with felony fleeing resulting in death. Pearl police, Flowood police, the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office and the Flowood Fire Department responded to the scene. Three weeks ago, another vehicle being pursued by Pearl police crashed into a U.S. Postal Service truck in Jackson, killing mail carrier Brad Pennington, 32. That chase began when police attempted to pull over a man for speeding. The man allegedly failed to pull over, and police chased him into Jackson until he crashed his Toyota Camry into Pennington’s mail truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nWyatt: A gas explosion Monday at a southeast Missouri home killed one person and injured nine others, authorities said. The explosion happened about 7 a.m. in Wyatt, a town of about 280 people that’s about 130 miles south of St. Louis, said Capt. Barry Morgan with the Mississippi County Sheriff’s Office. He said authorities were trying to determine whether a water heater or stove was to blame. He identified the person killed only as a man in his mid-20s. Nine other people – the youngest just 6 months old – had serious or critical burn injuries. Several were flown to hospitals in St. Louis and Memphis, Tennessee. “That is a ton of people in a house,” Morgan said. “So that’s what we’re trying to determine, why there were so many people in there, because when I arrived on scene, it was just there was victims lying everywhere, badly burned.” The garage of a neighboring home also caught fire, but no one inside that structure was hurt, Morgan said. The State Fire Marshal and a state propane commission were investigating.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native Americans who must travel long distances to election offices and cope with unreliable and infrequent mail delivery are further disenfranchised under election laws approved last year, a lawyer said Monday during opening statements in a trial challenging the laws’ constitutionality. Jacqueline De León, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, said she would present evidence that the laws ending Election Day voter registration in Montana and banning the paid collection of voted ballots put unreasonable barriers on Native Americans who already face other economic and logistical obstacles. The new laws were passed by the Legislature in 2021, and a similar ballot collection law was declared unconstitutional by two state judges in 2020. “We should not have to bring this case again. But we will certainly prove, once again, that Native Americans are disproportionately and unfairly impacted” by the two bills, De León said. The trial that began Monday in Billings also challenges a law that requires additional proof of residency besides student IDs for college students to register and vote. The trial before District Court Judge Michael Moses is scheduled to last 10 days.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state audit says the former head of the nonprofit History Nebraska organization diverted COVID-19 relief money to a private foundation, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Deputy State Auditor Craig Kubicek’s report suggested potential criminal liability for former History Nebraska Executive Director Trevor Jones over the 2020 transfer of two pandemic aid checks representing more than $270,000 to the History Nebraska Foundation, a then-new group that rivaled History Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As officials in some rural parts of the state vow to bypass voting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots this November, the Nevada secretary of state’s office is proposing statewide rules that would specify how to do it, including requiring bipartisan vote counters, creating room for observation and instructing how many ballots to count at a time. On Friday, four voting rights groups came out against the proposal, calling it an “admirable attempt to ensure higher standards” for counting votes by hand but urging the secretary of state to prohibit the practice outright, noting that the push for hand-counting stems from “unfounded speculation” about voting machines. “The regulations are not enough to address the underlying accuracy issues and remediate the legal deficiencies of hand count processes,” the groups Brennan Center, All Voting is Local, ACLU Nevada and Silver State Voices said in a statement Friday. Both voting rights groups and hand-counting proponents spoke at an online hearing Friday, the first meeting convened to discuss the regulations. Voting rights groups lobbied to prohibit hand counts, while voting machine skeptics, a majority of the speakers, said the proposed regulations were a power grab meant to sabotage hand-counting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: As COAST enters its 40th year, the regional bus transportation service is preparing to build a new operations, maintenance and administrative facility, funded in large part by $7.7 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas were among those legislators instrumental in getting the $7.7 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to improve public transportation in the area. “COAST has provided reliable public transportation throughout the Seacoast region for more than 40 years,” Shaheen said. “Its current Dover facility is too small and outdated to achieve its full potential, which is why I helped secure this $7.7 million grant to construct a new facility. This improved facility will advance the quality and sustainability of public transit in the region, which will help drive local economic growth.” Hassan said the grant will “ensure that Granite Staters can get where they need to go safely and efficiently,” while Pappas noted “this grant will help COAST achieve its mission of providing affordable and accessible public transportation.” COAST said the federal funding will greatly enhance its ability to meet the Seacoast’s public transportation needs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: With three state Supreme Court seats vacant, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner announced that a trio of appellate court judges would be temporarily promoted to fill the gaps. The order, issued Monday, comes amid a “crisis” of judicial vacancies statewide, causing massive backlogs for cases such as divorces and estate settlements. That shortage includes the New Jersey Supreme Court, which hasn’t had as many vacancies as it does now in recent memory – an “outrageous” scenario, one lawyer said. “Assigning one appellate judge is not uncommon, but three may be unprecedented,” said Carl Golden, who was director of communications for the judiciary from 1990 to 1993 under then-Chief Justice Robert Wilentz. Rabner’s order named Judges Clarkson Fisher Jr., Jack Sabatino and Douglas Fasciale to the state’s highest court. These judges, “who are senior in service,” Rabner said, will “participate in new matters presented for the court’s consideration.” Jeralyn Lawrence, president of the state’s bar association, said these jurists are the “best of the best,” but this is “not what the constitution envisioned, and the triage continues.” “All three levels of our courts are being impacted solely because our governor and our Legislature can’t fill these vacancies, and they are hurting the public,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Cowboys for Trump founder Couy Griffin is fighting to keep his seat as a county commissioner as he faces possible removal and disqualification from public office for his participation in last year’s insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Griffin was previously convicted of a misdemeanor for entering Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Three residents of Santa Fe and Los Alamos counties filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Griffin from being commissioner of Otero County’s 2nd district for the rest of his term. Griffin, a 47-year-old Republican, is representing himself in the two-day bench trial that began Monday. “This lawsuit is about removing a duly elected county commissioner from office through the civil court,” Griffin said in court. “By allowing this case to move forward, you’re going to set a very dangerous precedent.” On the witness stand Monday, Griffin said he went to Washington, D.C., to peacefully protest and pray with other Trump supporters. “I had no intention of breaking the law on that day,” he said. The three plaintiffs in the case argued in a 259-page petition that Griffin should be disqualified from holding public office on the basis of a clause in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is endorsing Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler in his contentious primary contest with another veteran U.S. House member from the state, Carolyn Maloney. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that “New York has a lot of outstanding leaders but few of them lead with the courage, conviction, and brilliant legislative effectiveness” that Nadler has. He called Nadler a “critical partner” who “was right on the issues years before so many others.” Nadler, 75, and Maloney, 76, have each represented Manhattan-area districts in Congress for 30 years but have gone from allies to rivals after their Upper West Side and Upper East Side districts were drawn together under new redistricting maps. Schumer’s backing comes on the heels of Nadler winning an endorsement from The New York Times over the weekend ahead of the Aug. 23 primary. The newspaper’s endorsement carries a lot of weight in deep-blue New York City but is expected to be especially decisive in a contest featuring two veteran lawmakers. Nadler and Maloney chair the powerful House Judiciary and Oversight committees, respectively. Another Democrat, 38-year-old attorney Suraj Patel, is also running in the primary race for New York’s 12th District.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: After receiving more than a dozen reports of conduct violations by party-appointed poll watchers during the May primaries, the state elections board tightened regulations for precinct observers Tuesday to prevent partisan interference in the November general election. The board unanimously voted to approve temporary rules for the upcoming election that more clearly outline the code of conduct for partisan observers, prohibiting them from standing close to a “tabulator, laptop, pollbook or other voting document” where they could view marked ballots or confidential voter information. The revisions heighten scrutiny for observers and poll workers alike, adding to a list of prohibited conduct for precinct officials that forbids them from tampering with voting equipment or expressing their political views on the job. While poll watching has been an element of electoral transparency since the 1800s, the practice grew in prominence in the 2020 election cycle due to ex-President Donald Trump’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud. A survey of county elections directors in late May found violations in 15 North Carolina counties, where officials observed poll watchers harassing voters and attempting to enter restricted areas to view confidential voting records.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Monday that he’ll work with legislators on a bill next session to “guarantee that the opportunity exists” for students and elected governing bodies to say the Pledge of Allegiance, if they choose. The Republican governor’s announcement comes after the Fargo School Board last week announced plans to stop reciting the pledge on the grounds that it doesn’t align with the district’s diversity code. Under current state law, governing bodies and schools can’t be required to recite the pledge. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the governor’s aim is to ensure that those who wish to say it may legally do so. “America is the land of opportunity. And students in every public school in North Dakota, along with elected governing bodies and those who attend their meetings, should have the opportunity to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and express support for the American ideals upon which our country was founded,” Burgum said in a statement. “Our administration is creating a framework for legislation to guarantee that the opportunity exists to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, as other states have done,” the statement said. Burgum said he is working with state Sen. Scott Meyer of Grand Forks and state Reps. Pat Heinert of Bismarck and Todd Porter of Mandan to draft the legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio mothers who rely on Medicaid will now be eligible for up to a year of health coverage after the birth of a child, up from 60 days previously. Up to 21,000 low-income and disabled people annually will benefit from this change, said the Ohio Department of Medicaid, which announced the change before April but only received final approval from the federal government Tuesday. “We know that access to postpartum care not only saves lives but leads to better health outcomes for moms and their babies,” Maureen Corcoran, director of Ohio Medicaid, said in a statement. “Extending eligibility for a full year postpartum ensures women have access to critical services that impact maternal morbidity and mortality as well as the health of their baby.” Available coverage includes treatment for postpartum depression; medical care for chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes; breastfeeding resources; and nurse home visits. The change was initiated by state lawmakers in the previous state budget. Ohio suffers from one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the nation, at 6.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019. The extended coverage, for now, will be available for a five-year period through April 2027.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt granted death row inmate Richard Glossip a 60-day stay of execution Tuesday while a state appeals court considers his claim of innocence. Stitt signed an executive order delaying Glossip’s execution for the 1997 killing of Glossip’s boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, that was scheduled for Sept. 22. “This stay is granted to allow time for the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to address a pending legal proceeding,” the order said. A Stitt spokeswoman declined to comment on the governor’s decision, which also means that a clemency hearing before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that was scheduled for next week will be delayed. Glossip asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for a new evidentiary hearing following the release of an independent investigation by Houston law firm Reed Smith that raised new questions about his guilt. The firm’s report did not find any definitive proof of Glossip’s innocence but raised concerns about lost or destroyed evidence and a detective asking leading questions to Glossip’s co-defendant, Justin Sneed, to implicate Glossip in the slaying. Sneed admitted killing Van Treese but said he did so at Glossip’s direction. Sneed was sentenced to life in prison and was a key witness against Glossip.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s chief justice fired all the members of the Public Defense Services Commission on Monday, frustrated that hundreds of defendants charged with crimes and who cannot afford an attorney have been unable to obtain public defenders to represent them. The unprecedented action comes as Oregon’s unique public defender system has come under such strain that it is at the breaking point. Criminal defendants in Oregon who have gone without legal representation due to a shortage of public defenders filed a lawsuit in May that alleges the state is violating their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. In a letter to the commission members, Chief Justice Martha Walters said that “it is now clear that it is time to reconstitute the current commission.” Oregon’s public defender system is the only one in the nation that relies entirely on contractors: Large nonprofit defense firms, smaller cooperating groups of private defense attorneys that contract for cases and independent attorneys who can take cases at will. But some firms and private attorneys are periodically refusing to take new cases because of the workload. Poor pay rates and late payments from the state are also a disincentive. The American Bar Association found that Oregon has only 31% of the public defenders it needs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBerwick: Two people remained in critical condition Tuesday after a car drove through a crowd at a weekend fundraiser for victims of a house fire, killing one woman and injuring 17 other people, authorities said. Of the 17 injured, two remained in critical condition in Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, while five others were listed as fair, a hospital spokesperson said. Ten other people had been released following treatment at several hospitals, state police said. Adrian Oswaldo Sura Reyes, 24, is charged with homicide in the death of 50-year-old Rebecca Reese, of Wilkes-Barre, at the fundraiser in Berwick shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. He faces another homicide count in the slaying of his mother at their Nescopeck home minutes later. Police allege in a criminal complaint that Sura Reyes told investigators he was driving in Berwick after arguing with his mother. At the time, about 75 people were in a blocked-off parking lot outside the Intoxicology Department bar for a fundraiser to benefit victims of the Aug. 5 blaze in Nescopeck that killed seven adults and three children. Police say Sura Reyes told them he drove past, then turned and headed back “to drive through the crowd of people.” They allege that video corroborates his alleged statement to investigators that he “sped up into the crowd purposefully.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A carousel that’s the last vestige of an amusement park next to the Providence River is spinning again after getting a new foundation. The Crescent Park carousel started running again Aug. 6 and will continue to operate Saturdays and Sundays between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. until Oct. 10, as well as on three Fridays: Aug. 26, Sept. 23 and Oct. 21. Rides cost $2. Having sat closed since the start of the pandemic, as cleaning procedures would have damaged the antique horses, dragons and a camel, crews used the time to stabilize and then replace the carousel’s foundation. This month, as it cranked up again after the hiatus, the carousel gave 958 rides. Carousel Manager Tracy Johnson is training new staff members on how to operate the attraction. Caretaker Ed Serowik said he started working at what was then the Crescent Amusement Park as a child in 1948, setting up pins at the bowling alley before working the carousel in 1950. He is now one of the primary people conducting maintenance on the ride. “It’s exactly the same,” he said, looking up at the mirrors that ring the carousel.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A small group of state lawmakers have given their approval to a near-total abortion ban that does not include exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The 3-1 vote Tuesday – all Republicans on a House subcomittee for it and the lone Democrat against – set up a showdown later in the day on whether to send the restrictive bill to the House floor. South Carolina currently has a six-week ban passed in 2021 that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Republican lawmakers plan a special sessions over the next month to consider even more restrictions. The bill bans all abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. It lists a number of different medical emergencies that would fit into the exceptions. The legislation still has a long way to go before it could reach Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who has said he wants to see no abortions in the state. Opponents and supporters alike said the proposal could change considerably on its way through the General Assembly. Outside the House’s office building on Statehouse grounds, about a dozen demonstrators with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic gathered. They were outnumbered by law enforcement, who set fencing and barricades expected to stay up most of the week.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Final vehicle counts for vehicles entering Sturgis indicate traffic was up 2% from the past five years during the 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, according to the South Dakota Department of Transportation. A total of 502,835 vehicles entered Sturgis over 10 days, according to SDDOT. The previous five-year average was 492,535 vehicles. The first day of the rally on Aug. 5 had 11% more traffic than the past five years, according to SDDOT.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Predators Foundation is teaming up on an event offering people gift cards, preseason vouchers and giveaways if they turn in guns to the city’s police. The NHL team says its foundation is partnering on the event Saturday at Greater Revelations Missionary Baptist Church. People can turn in guns to the Metro Nashville Police Department there with no questions asked. They can also drop off unused or expired medication that police will destroy. In seven Gift Card for Guns days since 2011, people turned in 658 firearms. It’s the first year the Preds Foundation has been involved in the event. Predators Vice President of Community Relations Rebecca King expressed hope that the initiative would make the community safer.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As they consider pay raises for other city employees, the Austin City Council’s members this week are poised to give themselves a 40% pay raise – one some members defend as long overdue and more reflective of the hours they work. The topic will come up Wednesday as the council works on setting the city’s operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The money for the pay increase would come from the additional $20 million the city recently discovered for the council to spend in any way it sees fit. Several council members say there is enough money available not only to boost their pay but also to identify an estimated $5 million to $10 million needed to raise the minimum hourly wage for city employees to $20. In total, the council pay raises would cost the city’s taxpayers an additional $371,000 per year. “The dollar amount we’re talking about is very little in the scheme of things,” Council Member Ann Kitchen said. This year, Austin’s 10 district council members are each making $83,158 – about the same as a sixth-year officer with the Austin Police Department. The last time the council approved a pay increase for themselves was in 2006, when a council member made $57,736 and the mayor made $67,981. Since then, they’ve received only cost-of-living increases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Utah Democratic Party is suspending a longtime lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct from party-related activities at all levels and has called for state Sen. Gene Davis to step down from the Legislature. The decision, announced in a statement over the weekend, came after a former intern’s allegation exposed a rift in the party over its handling of sexual harassment. In prior statements, the party’s stance was that it couldn’t take action unless it received an official complaint, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Following Ms. Weglinski’s statement last week, party leaders and members of the Executive Committee spoke privately with Senator Davis,” Utah Democratic Party Executive Director Thom DeSirant wrote in the statement. “Though he denied specifics of the allegations in his interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, we believe the behavior he acknowledged, regardless of context or intent, was unacceptable. We requested he voluntarily step down.” University of Utah student Sonia Weglinski, a former intern who also worked on the senator’s reelection campaign this spring, said in an Aug. 3 Instagram post that Davis touched her in ways that made her feel uncomfortable on multiple occasions during the five months she worked with him.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The certification of last week’s primary election results in Vermont has been delayed by a technical issue, the secretary of state’s office announced Tuesday. The statewide and federal primary election canvassing was expected to take place Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office said a state software contractor has been unable to resolve a technology issue affecting the office’s ability to produce reports from votes submitted by town and city clerks. The process is separate from the official counting of ballots and local certification by town clerks, the office said, adding that the delay does not impact its 100% confidence in the accuracy of the vote totals reported by town clerks. “The Secretary of State’s mission is to provide a secure and accurate election. The office will always default to a delay to ensure integrity and confidence of the results when they are certified,” the office said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An author’s investigative effort to uncover the origins of a racist photo on Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page has ended inconclusively, according to the author, who has written a book that offers new details about the 2019 scandal and the former governor’s remarkable political survival. “Of course, I would like to have determined exactly who was in the photograph. And I gave that my best effort,” Margaret Edds, a retired journalist and the author of “What the Eyes Can’t See,” told The Associated Press ahead of the book’s November publication. Although Edds – like journalists and two groups of law firm investigators before her – did not arrive at any definitive answer about the photo of one person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan costume, her 296-page book offers a behind-the-scenes look at the turmoil the image sparked. The book details Northam’s decision to remain in office despite tremendous pressure, as well as the steps he took to become better informed about the legacy of racism, redeem his reputation and work with Black leaders to sharpen his administration’s focus on racial justice. Northam participated in 14 interviews for the book. “What the Eyes Can’t See” also draws on interviews with Northam’s wife, staffers, consultants, friends and public officials.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The West Seattle Bridge will open Sept. 18, according to the Seattle Department of Transportation. The date is the most specific milestone set by the city since the bridge closed more than two years ago due to safety concerns, and it provides weary West Seattle travelers with a beacon of hope. The city previously set the week of Sept. 12 as its window for reopening the bridge but hedged the announcement with caveats about possible unanticipated hiccups in the final stretch of construction. The date provided Thursday reflects the progress crews have made in recent months, most notably the final post-tensioning of nearly 50 miles of new cable, which compress the span of the bridge to strengthen the concrete, The Seattle Times reports. The cables are anchored by concrete blocks capable of holding 20 million pounds of force. SDOT previously hoped to open the bridge in July, but a labor strike of concrete workers delayed progress. The 40-year-old bridge is among the city’s most important, previously allowing 100,000 drivers and 20,000 transit users to move between West Seattle and the rest of the city every day.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is making it easier for residents to get a REAL ID ahead of the May 3 federal deadline. The department recently announced a new online service that offers a guided path through pre-enrollment and cuts the time spent at the DMV, according to a news release. REAL ID Headstart allows applicants to verify their identities, upload required documents, and schedule their REAL ID appointments online. While the federal REAL ID Act requires documents be presented in person, a change is in progress. Once the act is amended, the DMV aims to enhance REAL ID Headstart so that no in-person visit is needed. Congress passed the Real ID Act in 2005 to establish minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission. The updated identification cards will be required for airport check-in and to enter federal facilities. REAL ID Headstart is available at dmv.wv.gov.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state can’t impose property taxes on tribal lands that have changed hands unless it gets congressional approval, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. The decision from a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marks another chapter in a lawsuit four Chippewa tribes from northern Wisconsin filed in 2018. The Lac Courte Oreilles, the Lac du Flambeau, the Red Cliff and the Bad River sued after the state imposed property taxes on land within their reservations. Such land is immune from state property taxes under an 1854 treaty, but the state argued that the land is eligible because tribal members sold it to non-American Indians before the land was were sold back to tribal members. The three-judge panel affirmed that the land isn’t taxable without congressional approval, saying only Congress can diminish tribes’ sovereignty, and the treaty is best read to promise tax immunity even for reacquired lands.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The tax incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act and a $2.5 billion infusion from Congress last year are spurring hopes of more carbon storage projects in the rolling prairie lands of northeastern Wyoming. Geologist Fred McLaughlin has been drilling nearly 2 miles into the ground, far deeper than the thick coal seams that make this the top coal-mining region in the United States. McLaughlin and his University of Wyoming colleagues are studying whether tiny spaces in rock deep underground can permanently store vast volumes of greenhouse gas emitted by a coal-fired power plant. The concept known as carbon storage has long been touted as an answer to global warming that preserves the energy industry’s burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity. One goal of McLaughlin’s project is to preserve the lifespan of a relatively new coal-fired power plant, Dry Fork Station, run by Basin Electric Power Cooperative. State officials hope it will do the same for the whole beleaguered coal industry that still underpins Wyoming’s economy. The state produces about 40% of the nation’s coal, but declining production and a series of layoffs and bankruptcies have beset the Gillette area’s vast, open-pit coal mines over the past decade.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers.

Parks, a Black seamstress and activist who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955, was convicted of violating racial segregation laws. King, who helped lead the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott, paid a $500 fine after being convicted in 1956 of violating a law banning boycotts. Parks refused to pay her $10 fine, and she and King went on to become icons of racial justice and the modern civil rights movement. Yet their cases remain on the books, said civil rights attorney Fred Gray, who represented both. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey said he would generally support a move to expunge the arrest records of King and Parks, but he’d need to see details of any such request before responding in court. Colvin asked a court last week to remove records stemming her from arrest and conviction after she refused to move to the back of a bus in 1955 in Montgomery, before Parks did the same. Now 82, Colvin – who was a 15-year-old high school student when she was convicted of assaulting an officer during her arrest and declared delinquent – isn’t sure such an effort would be possible since there was so much injustice for so long. “That would take a hundred years, maybe 200 years to go through the court system,” she said. “You could never finish it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Twelve bears have been killed in the city this year, including four last week, that were deemed dangers to life and property, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The southeast Alaska city “has a garbage problem,” Stephen Bethune, a wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, told the local Assembly recently. “Neither I or any of my agency colleagues like killing bears or the labor that ensues but will continue to do so as necessary,” he said. “However, removing bears from the population only serves to treat the symptom and fails to cure the root problem. ... That problem can be linked directly to Sitka’s current garbage disposal system and the unwillingness or inability of some members of the public to properly store trash.” He urged the use of bear-resistant trash cans and told the newspaper he would encourage the use of electric fences to help deter bears. Teal West owns a car damaged by bears last month. “My back trim and my back bumper were basically ripped off my car,” West said. “I taped the bumper back on, but I’m looking at around $6,000 worth of damage.” Bethune said he hopes the tension with bears in town eases soon. “Hopefully in the next couple weeks they’ll disappear, go up into the hills for the winter,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Conservationists and state officials say the popularity of Oak Creek Canyon, near Sedona, has created some real ecological problems for the corridor. A group of Arizona Conservation Corps members recently completed the second phase of a project that officials hope will rehabilitate many areas hit hard by visitors, improve water quality in the creek, and protect habitat for the threatened narrow-headed garter snake, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. A collaboration among the AZCC, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the National Forest Foundation and the Coconino National Forest’s Red Rock District, among other groups, the project seeks to close hundreds of unofficial social trails that crisscross the area between the highway and the creek. Large rocks have been stacked under a fence. Guardrails installed along 89A have limited roadside parking spots that led visitors to cut more and more new trails. Teams have installed low fencing and placed thick blankets of cut juniper limbs along the edge of pull-offs. And they’ve improved about 40 trails in an effort to leave direct pathways to the creek, reducing erosion and making them safer. Over the last year, AZCC crews have addressed nearly 200 social trails along the creek corridor, said Ron Tiller, a Department of Environmental Quality scientist. In one area, he said, they cataloged 47 individual trails visitors had cut within just a quarter-mile stretch. The foot traffic increases erosion of sediment into the creek and often contributes to outbreaks of E. coli as human waste left by visitors is swept into the water.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Jim Bob Duggar, whose large family was featured in the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” has announced he’s running for a seat in the state Senate. Duggar, who previously served in the state House, announced Friday on the family’s Facebook page that he’s running for the northwest Arkansas district that includes Springdale. Last week, Republican state Sen. Lance Eads resigned the seat to take a job in the private sector. A special election will be called to fill the term. TLC pulled “19 Kids and Counting” in 2015 over revelations that Duggar’s son Josh had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter. His parents said he confessed to the fondling and apologized. Josh Duggar has also apologized for his pornography addiction and for cheating on his wife. Josh Duggar is set to go to trial in federal court in November on two counts of downloading and possessing child pornography. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count if convicted. A longtime family spokesman, Chad Gallagher, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that no family “is immune from tragedy, heartbreak or impact from the decisions of the ones they love.” He added that it’s “important to note that Josh is a grown adult.” Jim Bob Duggar, who was born and raised in Springdale, and his wife, Michelle, have 20 children and 22 grandchildren.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $650 million plan would give the Los Angeles Zoo a theme park-style transformation over the next 20 years. The city-owned zoo in the city’s Griffith Park area would get exhibit upgrades and new attractions such as a 60-foot-deep canyon for rock climbing and a hilltop building called the California Center in the style of a Yosemite National Park lodge with a sweeping view of a 25,000-square-foot vineyard, the Los Angeles Times reports. Supporters of the zoo’s “20-year Vision Plan” said building the features would increase zoo attenance by 72%, to up to 3 million visitors annually. But the construction would consume 23 acres of native woodlands, drawing opposition led by the historical preservation group Friends of Griffith Park and the California Native Plant Society. Zoo officials were thinking about the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games as they crafted the plan, said Denise Verrett, the zoo’s director and chief executive. The renovation would happen in seven phases starting next year and would be funded by grants and donations raised by the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, a nonprofit support group, and possibly a bond issue, according to the Times. The next step for the proposal is consideration by the Los Angeles City Council’s Arts, Parks, Health, Education, and Neighborhoods Committee.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: Three police officers and two paramedics indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain appeared in court for the first time Monday since being charged. Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and fire Lt. Peter Cichuniec each took turns standing before Judge Priscilla Loew with their lawyers in a courtroom in Brighton. As McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, watched from the gallery with her lawyers, each waived a reading of the charges and penalties they face. None was asked to speak. McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, died after being put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter in the Denver suburb of Aurora that provoked a national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. He never regained consciousness and was later declared brain-dead at a hospital. While the former district attorney said he could not file charges because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died, the officers and paramedics were indicted by a grand jury this summer over a year after Gov. Jared Polis ordered state Attorney General Phil Weiser to open a criminal investigation into the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: With the legalization of recreational cannabis for adults and the impending start of retail sales in the state next year, several coastal towns are saying no, for now. Guilford, Madison and North Branford recently put in place measures that stop cannabis establishments from opening for nine months to a year from now, and Clinton has made it unlawful for any building, structure or land to be used as a cannabis establishment, producer, retailer or dispensary, the New Haven Register reports. The law signed in June by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont law allows individuals ages 21 and older to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material” and up to 5 ounces in a locked container in a home or in the trunk or locked glove box in the person’s vehicle. Retail sales of recreational cannabis in Connecticut are not expected to begin until summer 2022 at the earliest. Clinton town manager Karl Kilduff told the Register that at a public hearing in September on the issue, 15 of 17 people spoke against allowing cannabis establishments in the town. The town’s police chief also expressed concern about a “black market” developing alongside the legal market.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The University of Delaware has introduced new safety measures following student protests that criticized the school’s delayed action after a student was charged with attacking his ex-girlfriend, also a UD student, on Oct. 8. The security initiatives, which went into effect last week, include an expanded safety escort program, a new nighttime shuttle service and a reevaluation of the blue light phone system that connects students to police. “The safety of our community is our top concern and we’ll be actively driving improvement of all available resources for our students to address that priority head on,” John Long, the university’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. Long, who oversees the units in charge of campus safety, said he worked with President Dennis Assanis and other campus leaders to develop the new pilot programs. He said they are specifically focused on students going to and from their residences. University police officers will now have a golf cart to drive students to and from on-campus residences, according to the announcement. Those in nearby off-campus housing can take a shuttle from four on-campus locations. Both programs will run from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., seven days a week. Students can request rides using the LiveSafe app or by calling 831-RIDE.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A George Washington University fraternity house was broken into and vandalized, with a Jewish text desecrated, WUSA-TV reports. George Washington University Police are investigating the incident in which a Torah scroll at Tau Kappa Epsilon was destroyed. The crime happened Saturday and was discovered Sunday morning, according to a police report. “Our entire chapter is outraged and saddened by the blatant act of antisemitism against our brothers,” the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity said in a statement on Instagram. The fraternity said it is cooperating with police and the Anti-Defamation League. In a tweet, the ADL’s D.C. regional office said it was disturbed by the incident and said officials were in touch with students and the campus police. “We expect a full and rapid investigation,” the ADL said. University President Thomas LeBlanc issued a statement late Sunday saying George Washington University Police is working with D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department to find who is responsible. “I want to be clear: I condemn all such acts of antisemitism and all forms of hatred, discrimination, and bias in our community. Any act of antisemitism is an attack on the entire GW community and cannot, and will not, be tolerated,” LeBlanc said in the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The University of Florida is prohibiting three professors from providing expert testimony in a lawsuit challenging a new law that critics claim restricts voting rights, saying it goes against the school’s interest by conflicting with the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis. Though the decision is being criticized as threat to academic freedom and free speech, the university said in a statement Saturday that allowing professors Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin to serve as paid experts for plaintiffs challenging the law would be “adverse to the university’s interests as a state of Florida institution.” Lawyers for a coalition of civic groups challenging the law said in court papers Friday that the professors were told by the university that their expert testimony would dissent from the DeSantis administration, creating a conflict for the school. Attorneys for the professors said Saturday that they would take legal action claiming violations of the First Amendment and academic freedom if the school doesn’t reverse the decision. “The university cannot silence the professors on matters of great public importance. These professors are citizens entitled to participate in the marketplace of ideas,” attorneys Paul Donnelly and Conor Flynn said in a letter to a university lawyer. “These unlawful restrictions are shameful, and could very well deter top scholars from joining UF’s ranks.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A large spider native to East Asia has spun its thick, golden web on power lines, porches and vegetable patches all over north Georgia this year – a proliferation that has driven some unnerved homeowners indoors and prompted a flood of anxious social media posts. In metro Atlanta, self-described arachnophobe Jennifer Turpin stopped blowing leaves in her yard after inadvertently walking into a web created by the Joro spider. Stephen Carter has avoided a walking trail along the Chattahoochee River where he encountered Joro webs every dozen steps. Farther east in Winterville, Will Hudson’s front porch became unusable amid an abundance of Joro webs 10 feet deep. Hudson estimates he’s killed more than 300 of the spiders on his property. “The webs are a real mess,” said Hudson, an entomologist at the University of Georgia. “Nobody wants to come out of the door in the morning, walk down the steps and get a face full of spider web.” The Joro – Trichonephila clavata – is part of a group of spiders known as orb weavers for their highly organized, wheel-shaped webs. Common in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan, Joro females have colorful yellow, blue and red markings on their bodies. They can measure 3 inches across when their legs are fully extended. Hudson is convinced they will spread across the South.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lava continues to pour out of Kilauea’s summit crater, more than a month after the latest eruption began at the Hawaii volcano. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday that lava was emerging from a single vent inside Halemaumau Crater. The eruption is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and isn’t threatening any homes. Nightime aerial video shot from a helicopter shows lava gushing from a vent and spreading across the crater floor. Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It has erupted dozens of times since 1952. The latest eruption began inside the crater Sept. 29. In 2018, the volcano erupted from vents within a residential neighborhood. That episode sent streams of lava across the Puna district of the Big Island, destroying farms and more than 700 homes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Instances of hoarding, illegal reselling and bad behavior by customers have caused the state agency that sells alcohol to change how it rolls out rare spirits at stores, officials said. The Idaho State Liquor Division late last month announced new rules involving rare but highly sought-after bourbons, whiskeys and other small-batch liquor offerings. That combination has resulted in what the agency calls unsavory behavior by some customers that includes harassment of store workers. The new rules mean the agency will now sporadically allocate rare products across its 67 retail outlets to create what it calls a “treasure hunt” approach. The agency also has stopped listing rare-product inventory on its website and will only sell alcohol visible on store shelves. The changes follow reports of shoppers getting “very aggressive with these products,” Tony Faraca, the Idaho State Liquor Division’s chief financial officer, told The Idaho Statesman. “We know that there is a lot of hoarding going on,” he said. “We know that there are illegal secondary sales going on. Our store employees are being harassed by these whiskey groups. It’s causing a lot of stress and turmoil with our staff.” He said some groups try to buy up rare bottles that have limits of one per customer. Some customers, armed with inventory details, have tried to persuade employees to go into storage and dig through unopened boxes. Now that the agency has stopped sharing inventory details, “our hope is that more people will get to partake in the rare product,” Faraca said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A judge on Monday suspended a Dec. 31 deadline for the city’s police officers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but didn’t interfere with a requirement that they be regularly tested for the coronavirus. Disputes over vaccinations should be handled as a labor grievance with an arbitrator, Cook County Judge Raymond Mitchell said. “The effect of this order is to send these parties back to the bargaining table and to promote labor peace by allowing them to pursue” remedies under Illinois law, Mitchell said. The grievance process could last months, the city said last week. Officers who haven’t been vaccinated still must be tested twice a week under city policy. Officers also can lose work and pay if they don’t disclose their vaccine status. “The principal risk to those who are unvaccinated is to themselves and to others who choose to be unvaccinated,” the judge said. Police Superintendent David Brown last week said 70% had disclosed their vaccination status, and 80% of those officers reported being vaccinated. Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration announced the vaccine policy weeks ago, drawing sharp objections from police union leaders. The judge noted that COVID-19 has killed many officers nationwide. “In light of that terrible sacrifice, the police unions’ request just to have their grievances heard seems a pretty modest task,” Mitchell said.\n\nIndiana\n\nConnersville: A fire that badly damaged a Black City Council member’s home is being investigated by the FBI after a racial slur was found spray-painted at the house. The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m. Friday at the home of Connersville City Councilman Tommy Williams, who is Black, while his wife said the couple and their two sons were away on vacation. The racial slur was painted on the back patio, and FBI agents spent Saturday at the house, Emma Williams said. FBI Special Agent Steve Secor confirmed Monday that the agency was working with state and local authorities investigating the fire in the 13,000-person city about 50 miles east of Indianapolis. Secor said no suspects had been immediately identified. Williams said she had no idea who would attack her family in this way, and she was forgiving whoever is responsible. “I’m grateful for our community,” Williams told WXIN-TV. “We have really good people here, and I don’t want this to be a message that represents our village here because it’s a lie. It’s not what we’re about here.” Tommy Williams, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker and Army veteran, was elected by a Republican caucus last year to fill a City Council vacancy. An online fundraiser had collected more than $30,000 on Monday to assist the family’s recovery.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Beef, chicken, bread, fruit and vegetables, and paper products are among items school districts are struggling to get so they can provide varied and quality meals to students. Schools are making changes to their breakfast and lunch menus “nearly weekly” to account for items that are delayed or unavailable, said Alison Demory, Iowa City schools’ nutrition services director. “If we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, we might feel a little better,” Demory told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “I’ve heard this isn’t going to go away any time soon.” Staffing shortages at food manufacturers and distributors are making it challenging to make and transport enough products to meet the demand, Demory said. Some items can be ordered only in a limited quantity, which may not meet the needs of the Iowa City district. “If we can only order two cases of a product at a time, that’s a problem,” Demory said. Instead of providing individual bags of chips, the district is purchasing bulk orders and portioning them out to students, which requires more preparation, Demory said, giving an example of how the supply chain shortages can cause more work down the line. Cedar Rapids schools have had to substitute products but are able to offer similar items to “maintain the quality and integrity of our meals,” said Jennifer Hook, Cedar Rapids schools’ food and nutrition department manager.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A first-year state lawmaker, who was reprimanded by his colleagues for abusive conduct before taking office, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Democratic state Rep. Aaron Coleman of Kansas City remained in custody Sunday afternoon, according to Johnson County Jail records. The 21-year-old was arrested Saturday evening by Overland Park police on a domestic battery charge. Police didn’t immediately respond to messages Sunday, and calls to Coleman’s cellphone rang unanswered Sunday. Coleman is not married, and details of his domestic situation were not immediately available. It wasn’t immediately clear what consequences Coleman might face in the House after his arrest. He was being held without bond ahead of a court appearance scheduled for Monday. “Given what little we know about the situation, I am concerned for everyone involved,” Speaker of the House Ron Ryckman told the Kansas City Star. “I know that law enforcement will thoroughly investigate and assess the situation so that we can take appropriate action.” House Democratic Leader Tom Sawyer said Coleman should resign. “This is extremely disturbing news. We are watching closely to make sure we gather all the facts,” Sawyer said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s workers are taking a cue from country crooner Johnny Paycheck, telling their employers to “take this job and shove it.” And they’re doing so at a rate higher than any other state in the country. In August, 84,000 Kentuckians quit their jobs – a 26,000-person increase from the number who quit in July, according to the State Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the mass exodus of workers in Kentucky, the commonwealth has the nation’s highest quit rate, the total number of workers who quit during an entire month as a percent of total employment. In Kentucky, the quit rate was 4.5% as of August – a 1.4% increase from the month prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The states with the next-highest quit rates were Georgia and Idaho, with rates of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. But there is a glimmer of hope for the commonwealth: 103,000 Kentuckians were hired in August 2021, with a hire rate of 5.5%, the fifth-highest of any state and 1.2% higher than the national average. Gov. Andy Beshear said during a recent press conference that “our challenges in the labor market are complex” but that “there’s some really good things going on right now,” and “people ought to feel more hope than concern.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is continuing its “Shot for $100” COVID-19 vaccine incentive program through November, hoping to persuade more people to get the shots by offering them money. More than 19,000 people have received a Visa cash card through the effort so far. The program aimed at college students started in August. Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded it in October to cover anyone getting newly vaccinated. The state Department of Health said 5- to 11-year-olds will be eligible if federal officials sign off on a vaccine for the children and if their parents give consent for them to get immunized. “Thanks to many Louisianans working together, the fourth surge is behind us, but in order to help avoid another surge we need many more of our people to get vaccinated,” Edwards, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This is how we’re going to put this pandemic behind us and protect our loved ones and our communities.” To be eligible, people must use one of the community-based vaccination sites listed on ShotFor100.com. A person may only participate once in the program. After getting the shot, those participating receive the gift card and must register it online so it will be loaded with $100. More information is available on the website or by calling Louisiana’s vaccine hotline at 1-855-453-0774.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The battle over a 145-mile electricity transmission line is the most expensive ballot-question campaign in the state’s history. More than $90 million from utilities has flowed into the fight over the $1 billion project funded by ratepayers in Massachusetts that supporters say would remove carbon from the environment and provide needed electricity. The high-stakes campaign put environmental and conservation groups at odds and pitted utilities backing the project against operators of fossil fuel-powered plants that stand to lose money. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who supports the project, made a last-minute pitch over the weekend for bold action against climate change. “We just can’t afford just to do nothing,” she said. A ballot question Tuesday will let Maine voters have their say. The project has received all the necessary permits, and construction began 10 months ago. But a court ruling called into question a state lease for a 1-mile section. More litigation is expected regardless of the outcome of the vote. Lewiston Mayor Mark Cayer said he doesn’t understand the opposition, noting that the new sections are being built in working forests that have been logged repeatedly over the years.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The process of recognizing saints in Catholicism can take generations, but the church can accelerate matters when it wants, as it did in the cases of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Pope John Paul II, waiving a five-year waiting period after their deaths to get the process started. Now a group of Baltimore Catholics says it’s time to expedite the cases of six other heroes of the faith. Parishioners of St. Ann’s Catholic Church, a predominantly African American congregation, and the two other churches in its pastorate, Historic St. Francis Xavier and St. Wenceslaus, seek to make the case that the church should immediately canonize six Black American Catholics. Those include Mother Mary Lange, a Baltimore nun who started and ran a school for Black children during the era of slavery. They supporters planned to use a special Mass at St. Ann’s on Monday night to advocate for the cause, and organizers have said they’ll also use the All Saints’ Day service to launch a national letter-writing campaign to Pope Francis. Also among the proposed candidates are a Haitian American former slave, Pierre Toussaint, who went on to became a successful business owner and philanthropist, and Mississippi-born scholar-evangelist Thea Bowman. They had to overcome so much racism inside and outside the church during their lives that their cases should be viewed as exceptional, said Ralph E. Moore Jr., a St. Ann’s member helping to lead the effort. The church has never made a Black American Catholic a saint.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOrleans: The Coast Guard and other authorities were searching off the coast of Cape Cod on Monday for a small plane that failed to arrive as scheduled Sunday night, officials said. The Piper PA-28 that departed from Reading, Pennsylvania, was reported missing about 10 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. It was headed to Chatham Municipal Airport in Massachusetts. One person was on board the plane, the Coast Guard said in a tweet. The original call was made to the Air Force Regional Command Center by a concerned friend who was waiting for the aircraft in Chatham. The Air Force then contacted the Coast Guard. The aircraft’s last transmitted transponder signal was at 6:49 p.m. descending at 4,000 feet per minute. The search taking place off Nauset Beach in Orleans involved a Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft and a helicopter and three Coast Guard vessels, as well as area harbormasters and other assets, the Coast Guard said. No information about the plane’s occupant was released.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: Business owners on Mackinac Island are celebrating a big rebound in tourism this year after fewer visitors made the journey to the island in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Many visitors discovered the iconic carless-island getaway for the first time this year, said business owners on the island, which sits in the Straits of Mackinac separating Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. Chris Shepler, a third-generation operator of Shepler’s Ferry, which shuttles visitors to Mackinac Island, said the summer “was out of control” for the ferry service. “Absolutely crazy. We set records for our all-time busiest summer in the history of our company,” he said. Through Sept. 1, the island’s overall hotel room revenue for the 2021 season was on pace to smash the record year it saw in 2019, when revenue topped $74.56 million, said Tim Hygh, executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau. Final data is still be crunched for 2021, he said. “It came after vaccinations, and people were so eager to travel. The market found us,” Hygh said. As everything closes up for the season on the island known for its hiking, biking and horse-drawn carriage rides, Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud said she’s cautious but hopeful about what 2022 may hold. “I look forward to moving out of the pandemic, but we are still in a pandemic,” said Doud, who is often found at the front desk of the iconic Windermere Hotel.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Those who monitor voting access for people with disabilities say the state generally does a good job on the issue, but it’s not without challenges. Minnesota Council on Disability ADA Director David Fenley said while barriers still persist, the state provides good general access for voters with different disabilities. Polling stations are equipped with an accessible voting machine for people with vision impairments, with many counties using an electronic ballot marker machine called AutoMARK. “Just say, ‘Hey, where’s your AutoMARK? I need an accessible voting machine,’ ” he advised. Grace Gouker Littlefield, executive director at a new Minnesota-based organization called Able to Vote, is working to connect people with voting resources. Littlefield said she wants to see more disabled voters like herself with equal access across the country, starting in her own backyard this fall, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. A chat feature on AbleToVote.org connects staff to people who need assistance finding transportation to the polls, coming up with a voting plan or reporting an accessibility barrier. “Just understand that the lives of people with disabilities can be very complex,” Littlefield said. “And this process should not be political, even though people are voting for political offices sometimes.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city will soon start installing larger water pipes to replace some of the lines that failed during a deep freeze that struck the Deep South in February. WLBT-TV reports 48-inch cast iron water transmission lines have been arriving in south Jackson. City engineer Charles Williams said officials gave the order last week to proceed with the final phase of the project, which involves laying 2 miles of pipes in the area. The work will connect water transmission lines from the O.B. Curtis Treatment Plant to south Jackson. They will replace 24-inch pipes that failed to provide adequate water pressure from the plant during the winter storm. Thousands of Jackson residents lost water service for weeks after the storm, and those with running water had to boil it because of the danger of contamination when pressure is low. “We’re actually placing a new water main service, and then we’ll be taking off some of the existing service lines that are in the area that are smaller and tie it into that 48,” Williams said. “So the improved capacity will help improve water pressure and also limit disruptions of service due to failed water mains.” The $8 million project is funded through federal money. Installation of the new pipes is expected to be complete by March 2023, depending on weather.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: One of the leaders of a St. Louis charter school has been appointed to the State Board of Education by Gov. Mike Parson. Kerry Casey will begin serving on the state board immediately, the governor’s office said Monday. Her term will run until July 1, 2027, if she is confirmed by the state Senate. The State Board of Education oversees Missouri’s 518 public school districts, 37 charter schools, and state schools for the blind, deaf and severely disabled. Casey, of Chesterfield, was a founding board member of the KIPP Charter School and continues to serve on its board. She also is vice president for global sales at Exegy, a financial markets data company. She replaces Victor Lenz of St. Louis, whose term on the State Board of Education expired in July 2019. Missouri law allows board members to continue serving until the governor appoints a replacement. Lenz had been serving as the board’s vice president. Two other board members also are serving on expired terms: President Charlie Shields of St. Joseph, whose term expired in July 2020, and Donald Claycomb of Linn, whose term expired this past July.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s redistricting commission delayed a decision on a map dividing the state into congressional districts after an all-day meeting Saturday. The commission failed to reach a consensus on the map proposals it was considering, instead kicking the decision until after receiving more public comments this week as it speeds toward a Nov. 14 deadline. The two Democrats on the commission pushed to approve a map they had proposed that would divide the state into an eastern and western district and place Kalispell, a Republican stronghold in the northwest corner of the state, in the eastern district. That map would give Democrats a fighting shot at winning in the western district despite the state’s increasingly red political hue. But the map faced opposition from Republican members of the commission, who are against placing the mountain community of Kalispell in an eastern district dominated by prairieland and agricultural communities. Commission Chair Maylinn Smith, who was appointed by the state’s Supreme Court, said she could not break the tie in favor of a proposal by Democrats or Republicans before receiving additional public comment on a new proposal submitted by the Republican members of the commission just two days before the meeting.\n\nNebraska\n\nBridgeport: One small western Nebraska county is using roughly half the federal coronavirus aid money it is set to receive for bonuses of up to $10,000 each for county employees. Morrill County officials approved the bonuses in August as hazard pay for the county’s roughly 50 employees, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The county is set to receive about $900,000 from the federal program. Most of the state’s 92 other counties are still deciding how to spend the roughly $376 million they will share from the American Rescue Plan Act, but the Morrill County attorney and officials with the Nebraska Association of County Officials say using the money for premium pay is allowed. Jon Cannon, the executive director of the counties group, said he’s telling officials not to rush to spend the money because they have until the end of 2024 to decide what to use it for. Morrill County officials said the bonuses were warranted because of the work employees did throughout the pandemic, which included keeping the courthouse in Bridgeport open the entire time. “There were a lot of things you couldn’t use it for,” said Jeff Metz, of Angora, chairman of the three-member Morrill County Board. “We ran across that one of the allowable expenses was hazard pay. We felt that fit with what we were trying to do.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The return this week of a big automotive products trade show is expected to draw as many as 100,000 people to the Las Vegas Convention Center, tourism and event officials said. The Specialty Equipment Market Association show, commonly known as SEMA, opens Tuesday, after being canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. It runs through Thursday, followed by a public event Friday dubbed “SEMA Ignited” in the convention center parking area. A companion event, the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo, will be held at the Sands Expo and Convention Center – part of what the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority dubs Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week. SEMA represents a multibillion-dollar automotive aftermarket industry and has been held in Las Vegas since 1977, when it moved from the Anaheim Convention Center in California. Electric vehicles will be featured this year, and convention attendees will be able to ride Tesla vehicles in the nearly 1-mile underground people-mover built between convention center stops by Elon Musk’s The Boring Co. SEMA executive Tom Gattuso told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the show this year has 51,000 registered buyers and could host 100,000 industry professionals.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: A company that offers old-fashioned train rides along Lake Winnipesaukee and the Pemigewasset River says it won’t operate its annual Santa Express Trains this season because of rising COVID-19 cases in the state. The Hobo & Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad said in news release Monday that it hopes to offer the holiday trips, during which participants meet Santa and Mrs. Claus, next year. The Santa Express trains run from Lincoln. The railroad still plans to reopen for its regular season next year in mid-May. “The railroad had planned to make Santa Express Train tickets available in early November, but due to COVID-19 positivity rates trending upward, we felt it best to hold off on ticket sales due to the surrounding uncertainty,” railroad manager Benjamin Clark said. Last week, Dr. Benjamin Chan, the state epidemiologist, said New Hampshire continues to have a high or substantial level of community transmission, averaging 500 to 550 new infections per day with a coronavirus test positivity rate around 6%.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Calls for help to a statewide children’s mental health hotline have increased compared to last year as parents seek help, especially during the morning hours, according to the commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The overall call volume to the Children’s System of Care increased, with the most calls coming from parents as their children experience stress before school hours, Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer said during a state COVID-19 briefing. “Getting adjusted to something as simple as taking the bus can be stressful,” she said, referring to behavioral and emotional challenges faced by K-12 students returning to in-person school after a year of hybrid or remote learning as “a pandemic of mental health.” It is typical to see a rise in mental health reporting from K-12 students during the month of October, when educators become familiar with their students and are able to assist parents in reporting complaints and concerns. But this year, the uptick in calls occurred in September, with more than 10,000 calls, peaking in the morning, and particularly on Monday mornings, said Jason Butkowski, a DCF representative. Such calls in the morning usually have to do with school-avoidant behavior.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBernalillo: Town officials deny wrongdoing in the installation of a hidden surveillance camera in a police office used by a now-former police sergeant who says her expectation of privacy was violated. An attorney for Monica Torres has formally notified the town that Torres intends to file a lawsuit alleging violation of a state law requiring consent from at least one person in a recording, KRQE-TV reports. Video obtained by KRQE shows a town worker installing the video camera in an air conditioning vent under the direction of Bernalillo Police Department Chief Broderick Sharp and a police lieutenant when Torres was on vacation in November 2020. “I freaked out,” Torres recalled to KRQE about when an office visitor spotted the camera a week or two later. “I had changed (clothes) numerous times in there.” KRQE reports it obtained records of a New Mexico State Police investigation prompted by a complaint by Torres. Video from the hidden camera showed a male sergeant shutting the door to change clothes inside the office, KRQE reports. The State Police investigation ended by concluding that no crime had been found. The matter was submitted to the District Attorney’s Office of the 13th Judicial District for review. That office said a special prosecutor would decide whether to file charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A giant red heart sculpture installed last week in Central Park as a tribute to health care workers and COVID-19 victims has been taken down – an apparent casualty of confusion and red tape. Italian sculptor Sergio Furnari said he was walking by the park Thursday afternoon with friends when he noticed that his “Heroes Heart Monument” was gone. When he went to file a police report, he said, he was bounced from police station to police station until a police officer on Friday showed him video of people removing the 10-foot-tall, 3,000-pound monument and placing it on a truck. “They literally broke my heart,” he said. Furnari conceded he did not have a permit to place the heart in the park but considered a $4,000 grant he received from New York City’s government to be his permit for the temporary installation. He said he considered the removal of his memorial “an abuse of power.” A message seeking comment was left with the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages the park on behalf of the city. Furnari said he planned to go to the organization Monday to find out what happened to his heart. Furnari said he wanted the sculpture to be a place for emotional and spiritual solace in the bustling city and not just a popular spot for selfies, though he said he was cool with that, too.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones has urged supporters of public education to organize to fight “anti-history laws” being promoted by Republican lawmakers. Hannah-Jones said the left hasn’t gotten “mad enough” in opposing the “culture war that has been contrived by the right wing” that has led to laws banning schools from teaching things such as her 1619 Project. She said at an online forum of North Carolina educators last week that people are living in “dark and scary times” in which teachers are “afraid to even teach and talk about the experiences that their children are having.” “We’re being outgunned right now, and I think that’s because this is not an issue that’s getting enough of the people on the left angry,” Hannah-Jones said. “People on the right are very angry, and anger is often what inspires you to organize and to push for laws and to push for these changes.” Hannah-Jones was the keynote speaker Tuesday at the Color of Education Summit, a two-day virtual event drawing 1,600 people “to engage in critical conversations centered on addressing issues of racial equity and education.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Paleontologists have given the name “Beautiful Nightmare” to a rare dinosaur fossil thought to be the only partial skull of its species found in North Dakota. “She is a beautiful example of her species, and she was a nightmare in her day to a lot of other critters,” said Fossil Excavators President Mike Kjelland, an assistant professor of biology at Mayville State University. The specimen, which includes an upper jawbone and lower teeth, is thought to be a Nanotyrannus, closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex. Only five Nano partial skulls have been found in the world, though there is debate about whether the fossils are instead of juvenile T. rex, Kjelland said. Researchers uncovered the Nano and myriad other fossils – some rare and potentially new species – on private land at a remote Badlands canyon Kjelland found two years ago near Bowman while looking for the fossil-rich Hell Creek Formation. The site comprises an ancient river channel and sandbar. The fossils, which date to 66 million to 69 million years ago, represent a diverse array of creatures from the Late Cretaceous, including two notable Triceratops skulls that drew national attention, The Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A concealed weapons permit would become optional, and the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers they are carrying a concealed weapon would be eliminated, under proposed legislation in the state House. The bill is similar to a measure pending in the state Senate and one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights in Ohio. The concealed weapons bill, dubbed “Constitutional Carry” by its backers, is sponsored by Republican Reps. Tom Brinker of Cincinnati and Kris Jordan of Ostrander. Gun owners could still apply for a concealed weapons permit under the measure, allowing those who obtain it to carry a concealed weapon in states with reciprocity agreements recognizing such permits. The GOP-controlled House Government Oversight Committee approved the bill along party lines last week. The concept has the backing of the Buckeye Firearms Association, which says 21 other states allow people to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Gun control groups such as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America oppose it, along with law enforcement groups. Rep. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, said the bill has been rushed with little time for discussion and would make Ohio less safe.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended Gov. Kevin Stitt spare the life of death row inmate Julius Jones, whose murder conviction for the 1999 killing of an Edmond businessman has drawn national attention. The board recommended in a 3-1 vote that Stitt grant Jones clemency and commute his sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole after hearing from Jones, 41, who testified via video link from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Several members of the panel agreed they had doubts about the evidence that led to Jones’ conviction. One board member, Scott Williams, recused himself from the vote because of an existing friendship with an attorney who has advocated for Jones. “I continue to believe there is still doubt in this case,” said board member Kelly Doyle. The lone vote against clemency came from Richard Smothermon, a former prosecutor, who said he believed Jones was not being truthful in his testimony. “To believe in Mr. Jones’ theory of the case, you have to disbelieve every other piece of evidence in the case,” including testimony from law enforcement officers, independent witnesses and physical evidence, Smothermon said. Stitt must now decide whether to grant clemency or commute Jones’ sentence.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An agreement has been reached between timber and environmental groups to overhaul management of 10 million acres of private forestlands in the state. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the deal, announced Saturday by Gov. Kate Brown’s office, concludes more than a year of negotiations to develop a plan to boost protections for vulnerable fish and wildlife while shielding the timber industry’s ability to log. Friday was the deadline for both sides to either reach consensus, abandon the process or move the deadline. “Today’s historic agreement is a perfect example of the Oregon Way – coming together at the table to find common ground, to the mutual benefit of us all,” Brown said in a statement. Jim James with the Oregon Small Woodlands Association similarly praised the compromise. “We were able to put down the contentious situations that we’ve had in the past, and we had a continuous agreement to move forward,” James said. Speaking on behalf of the timber coalition, Adrian Miller with the Florida-based forest products company Rayonier said Saturday’s agreement gives timber operators a sense of security going forward. “I think we’re all really proud to be part of a new era of forestry in Oregon,” Miller said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration told more than 70,000 state employees Monday that it is offering five days of paid leave for getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year, quickly drawing opposition from the state treasurer over the potential cost. The administration told employees that five days of “verification leave” can be used between Dec. 20 and March 31. Employees who don’t use the days by then will be paid for them, and an employee who has verified fully vaccinated status to the administration will automatically receive the days, it said. “This leave will help incentivize the vaccinations that protect commonwealth employees and the Pennsylvanians we serve,” the administration told employees. “It’s one more way we can show our gratitude to employees who step up to help us protect our communities and bring this pandemic to an end.” The administration already offers employees a paid day off to get vaccinated. Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, called on Wolf, a Democrat, to abandon the plan. Her office said the cost to taxpayers for paying employees who do not use the days could amount to more than $100 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal appeals court has upheld a settlement between Brown University and student-athletes who had challenged the Ivy League school’s decision to drop several women’s varsity sports. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the university and the athletes who originally sued in letting the settlement stand. Twelve athletes on the women’s gymnastics and ice hockey teams had asked the court to reject the settlement in the interests of current and future female athletes at Brown. The settlement, approved by a federal judge in Providence last year, restores the women’s equestrian and women’s fencing teams to varsity status and calls for an end in 2024 to a 1998 legal agreement ensuring gender equity in varsity sports at Brown. The legal challenge centered on the Providence school’s decision to reduce several women’s varsity sports teams to club status. Several men’s sports were also reduced to club status, although some were later restored. The student-athletes alleged that the cuts violated the 1998 pact. The 1998 agreement had stemmed from a legal challenge to Brown’s decision to cut women’s gymnastics and volleyball in the early 1990s. Brown has said the agreement established unique reporting requirements not faced by any other U.S. college or university.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Historic Columbia Foundation has unveiled a new look at the capital city’s LGBTQ past. Historic Columbia launched its comprehensive online oral history of the capital city’s gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer communities last month at the city’s Famously Hot South Carolina Pride festival. The foundation worked with the oral history department at the University of South Carolina to collect the stories of a diverse range of LGBTQ+ people in Columbia so that the often untold story of those communities in the Midlands can be honored and remembered. “We have to do this now before some of this stuff is lost forever,” said Kat Allen, director of research at Historic Columbia, who worked to put the comprehensive project together. “Every day more stuff gets thrown away. People pass away, and then someone says, ‘Nobody’s going to want this,’ but USC will absolutely take all of this stuff. … There are things we would have never known about without some of this material.” The project maps a timeline of Columbia’s LGBTQ+ history, from early 1900s drag shows and a procession of gay-friendly establishments to the first Pride March to the S.C. State House in 1990 that birthed today’s Pride festival.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Labor shortages in the service industry are high enough that there is now a $1,000 offer for new workers to move to the Mount Rushmore State. A new employee coming from out of state to work a job in retail, restaurants, hospitality, grocery, trades and other needed sectors can receive $1,000 payment through the South Dakota Retailers Association and its “$1,000 Workforce Incentive” push. SDRA, a partner organization for dozens of companies, is launching the $1,000 payment to supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives straight to new employees, according to a press release Monday. The cash payout would supplement any hiring bonuses or other incentives offered by an individual business. The incentive will be paid directly to an employee hired from out of state to work in a Retailers Association member business. To be eligible, an employee must work at least 30 hours per week for 90 days at a physical location in South Dakota. Additional eligibility details are available at www.sdra.org.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Grand Ole Opry’s broadcast of its 5,000th Saturday show attracted a host of big country music stars to its historic venue. Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Darius Rucker, Vince Gill, Chris Young and a half-dozen others lined up to celebrate the nearly century-old country music program. The radio broadcast was carried by WSM radio, the same station on which it debuted as the “Barn Dance” program in 1925. Bill Anderson, a 60-year Opry veteran, kicked off the show with the Roy Acuff tune “Wabash Cannonball.” Singer Vince Gill played an acoustic guitar he said was once owned by Opry star Sam McGee. Gill said McGee first played the famed radio program in 1926, months before the barn dance program became known as the Grand Ole Opry. Brooks and Yearwood closed the show with a set of several songs before Brooks ended with his country classic “Friends in Low Places.” “Happy 5,000 to the Grand Ole Opry,” Brooks said. “Can’t tell you how lucky we feel to be a part of it.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city’s school district is defying a request from a Republican state lawmaker for select school districts to investigate and catalog library and classroom books related to race, gender identity or sexuality. District spokesman Jason Stanford said in an email Friday that district officials “decided that a response is not necessary, especially since anyone can search our library catalogues on this website.” Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chairman of the Texas House General Investigating Committee, made the request to select superintendents and Texas Education Agency deputy commissioner Lily Laux in a letter with a list of more than 800 books for districts to check against library and classroom collections. The letter appears to have been sent to large urban and suburban school districts across the state, said Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards. The list includes award-winning books on race and social justice, as well as health books and guides, including “The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine” and titles on sexually transmitted diseases. The letter also called on districts to identify other books or content addressing “human sexuality” and “material that might make students feel discomfort ... or convey that a student, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,” mirroring language in a new Texas law targeting classroom discussions of such topics.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city, the 2021 DOCUTAH International Film Festival, and Art Around the Corner are collaborating to bring a mural to life for the public. Artists featured in the films “Alice Street and Prophets” and “Teachers & Kings” will create a mural on the side of the Electric Theatre in real time during the festival, which began Monday. This year’s mural will be a mix of artistry and an ode to filmmakers in the form of Charlie Chaplin filming a Shivwits powwow dancer and a jazz band with an artist using a paintbrush to depict the scene. Artists Desi Mundo and Pancho Peskador will be the featured artists. Initially, the films were set for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic put them on hold. The artists and films are now back for the 100-film festival and in what DOCUTAH considers an expanded edition of the festival. “This public space mural is intended to remind us that with understanding our past and looking toward our future, St. George continues to be a vibrant and welcoming place for all to enjoy,” said Rhondalon Crawford, Board Chair of the Art Around the Corner Foundation. “The partnership with DOCUTAH and the City of St. George demonstrates the commitment our community has to all of the arts and to providing our citizens and visitors with a wide variety of artistic experiences.”\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: State educational officials will ban spectators from a high school boys soccer state semifinal this week, following alleged racist behavior and overly rough gameplay between two schools’ players earlier this year. The Vermont Principals’ Association said in a statement Monday that “this decision has been made to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all student-athletes involved.” Winooski High School has said that during the first home game of the season, its players were targeted with racial slurs by Enosburg High School’s players and fans. There’s also a separate investigation into Winooski players getting violent with Enosburg players during that Sept. 18 game, which ended in a 3-2 Winooski win. In response to the alleged racial abuse during the game, Enosburg conducted an internal investigation but found no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the school said its report was incomplete without interviewing Winooski players, who declined to participate in the investigation. Winooski’s school officials said they believe what their student-athletes reported about the racial abuse from Enosburg. Winooski Athletics Director Sam Jackson has characterized the school as Vermont’s most diverse high school.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: A schoolhouse where enslaved and free Black children were taught before the Revolutionary War will be moved from the William & Mary campus to Colonial Williamsburg and restored to its original state, officials announced Friday. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is buying the building that housed the Bray School, the university and foundation said in a news release. Once modern additions to the building are removed, it will be moved a few blocks to the living history museum’s campus, where it will be restored and incorporated into the foundation’s public history programming. “This nondescript building that was hidden in plain sight for decades is taking the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and William & Mary in a new and exciting direction,” Colonial Williamsburg President and CEO Cliff Fleet said. “This important work will expand our understanding of 18th-century America and add to our body of knowledge about this important time in our nation’s history.” The university says the building is likely the oldest surviving schoolhouse for African Americans. It will be the first addition to Williamsburg’s collection of historic buildings since the 1960s. The foundation expects to restore the building by 2024, the 250th anniversary of the school’s closure just before the Revolutionary War.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The former Spokane County health officer who believes he was fired last year due to unpopular decisions he made to try to contain COVID-19 has filed a claim with the health district, which could lead to a lawsuit. The Spokesman-Review reports Dr. Bob Lutz filed the administrative claim Oct. 8. Robert Carlson, Lutz’s attorney, said the hope is that the district determines Lutz’s claim has merit and works to resolve the issue out of court. Lutz is claiming at least $1.4 million in damages for wrongful termination in addition to “defamation, emotional distress, mental anguish and injury to professional reputation” as a result of his firing in October 2020. The health district has 60 days to respond to Lutz’s claim, at which point Lutz could proceed with a lawsuit. The claim details several examples of alleged political pressure and tension between Lutz and certain Board of Health members throughout 2020, especially when the county was stuck in limited phases due to COVID-19 case rates. “I took a stand for Public Health. It cost me my job,” Lutz said in a statement released through his attorney. “As a public health physician, it has been my responsibility to protect the public’s health and safety.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University has launched its newly formed Institute for Cyber Security. Marshall President Jerome Gilbert said the institute is an academic and research cluster that will support cybersecurity-related programs across the campus. “We can do research and teaching to expand our presence in the cyber arena,” Gilbert said. The new center will work to address emerging needs in cybersecurity, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. David Dampier, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences, said it is designed to tap into a new mix of students and early-career professionals and connect those learners with top cybersecurity talent in the region. The institute is housed in the university’s Applied Engineering Complex.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gun dealers in the state are struggling to keep shelves stocked with ammunition. Supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic and increased demand for guns and ammunition have left shelves empty in some cases. And when a shipment does arrive at local gun stores, ammunition is quickly snapped up. Tony Blattler, of Phillips, watched as employees unloaded a shipment of .270 Winchester hunting cartridges recently at the Fleet Farm in Marshfield. Not long after, about two dozen people had filed into the store, grabbing ammunition as fast as workers could unload it, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “Probably by within an hour or two, they were sold out of that ammunition just by word of mouth,” Blattler said. Pat Kukull, owner of Superior Shooters Supply, said the store had a shortage of shotgun ammunition for trap shooting over the summer, with vendors sending maybe 2% of the usual 500 cases it might receive. She said there’s been “absolutely nothing” for those hunting pheasant, grouse or waterfowl. “Now, we’re moving into rifle season, and we haven’t had any .30-30 shells in a year to speak of, really,” Kukull said. Across Wisconsin, background checks for handguns surged 174% last year from 2019, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Employee transition efforts are ramping up with just a few weeks left before the state’s last underground coal mine shutters. The long-anticipated closure of the Bridger Underground Coal Mine was originally expected to affect 94 mine workers, according to the layoff notice sent to the Rock Springs City Council a month ago. The number of affected staff has since fallen to 89 and is continuing to shrink as staff leave to start new jobs, the Casper-Star Tribune reports. Rocky Mountain Power, whose subsidiary Bridger Coal Company owns the mine, hosted a job fair last month at which the workers it’s not retaining were able to interview with other mining companies. Two of the five companies were from out of state, meaning new hires would have to leave Rock Springs for work. But Rocky Mountain Power is also collaborating with Western Wyoming Community College in an effort to help underground mine workers access vocational training programs. Many will qualify for federal retraining funds targeting displaced coal workers. Employees’ existing skills also translate well to other mining jobs, including in the trona industry, which produces a source of soda ash, said Rick Lee, CEO of the Rock Springs Chamber of Commerce. The Green River Basin trona patch is about 40 miles from Rock Springs.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/26/school-satan-club-plane-swap-fail-amazon-helix-news-around-states/50142737/", "title": "After School Satan Club, plane swap fail: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will remember the Holocaust, the systematic slaughter of Jews and other people by Nazis, with events planned for this week in Montgomery and Birmingham. The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Center for Biological Diversity has joined with two smaller groups in announcing plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if federal officials don’t finish a status review on the thick-leaf bladderpod by mid-June, saying the agency is violating its own deadlines, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/01/lifeguard-death-traffic-ticket-scam-amherst-pushback-news-around-states/118519764/", "title": "Lifeguard death, traffic ticket scam, Amherst pushback: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Rural school districts are leading the state in reported COVID-19 case rates. When the Alabama Department of Public Health updated its COVID-19 school dashboard for the first time this school year Friday, three districts stood out with the highest percentage of confirmed cases: Covington, Greene and Marion county schools. All three are rural districts, and about 5% of students in each district have tested positive for the coronavirus. These schools were among only 52 of Alabama’s 137 school districts with available data on the state dashboard. In Marion, most of the 160 reported cases were concentrated in three schools, resulting in temporary closures, said Marion County Superintendent Ann West. “We’re just trying to operate with what’s best for each school,” West said. “I don’t like to send children home because for some of our students, what they get to eat is at school.” Masks are not required in Marion County Schools, but West said the district strongly encourages them. “Certainly, if I were not vaccinated, I would be wearing a mask,” she said. Meanwhile, masks are required in Greene County Schools, which reported 47 COVID-19 cases Friday. Covington County Schools reported 140 cases. According to district protocols, masks are “recommended for all individuals while indoors” and required on school buses.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Assembly has authorized a 20-year lease of land to an Alaska Native corporation for development for cruise ship passengers. The Assembly, voting 5-2, approved leasing 17 acres to Shee Atika Inc., which plans to work with another company, Adventure Sitka, to develop the land with attractions such as zip lines, a salmon bake and a canoe launch, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The land is between the ferry terminal and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Chris McGraw, who owns the terminal and manages Adventure Sitka, said development of the property will be an important part of handling an expected large number of tourists. “The key to over-tourism is good distribution of guests,” McGraw said at an Assembly meeting. Karl Potts, CEO of Shee Atika Inc., said the lease would generate $300,000 to $400,000 a year for the city. Assembly member Kevin Knox raised questions about staffing at the site, citing difficulties businesses are having this year with hiring staff. But he said he would vote “yes” because of an expected influx of passengers next year. “We don’t have a lot of options here,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The FBI’s Public Corruption unit is investigating efforts by Gov. Doug Ducey’s past and current staffers – including one who is now a federal judge – to push for a closed-door deal to issue tax refunds worth as much as $100million to aid one of Ducey’s campaign supporters. Grant Nulle, former deputy director at the Department of Revenue, said an FBI agent contacted him in mid-July, shortly after an Arizona Republic investigation uncovered how the Ducey administration had pushed the department to agree to refund sales taxes on fuel for mining companies, even though that tax had been in place for decades. The companies that stood to benefit were represented by Texas tax firm Ryan LLC, founded by Ducey supporter G. Brint Ryan. The top three deputies in Ducey’s administration left their government jobs and went to work for Ryan to push for the tax refund. The men and others working for Ducey met with Revenue officials at least 16 times to insist that the department – which was under their oversight in the governor’s office – agree to stop opposing Ryan and issue a tax refund to one fuel company. That, officials said, would have triggered refunds in all other similar cases, costing the state’s general fund more than $100 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients on a ventilator climbed to a new high Monday as the state reported 33 new coronavirus deaths amid the summer surge driven by the highly contagious delta variant. The Department of Health reported the state’s COVID-19 patients on ventilators rose by 17 to 361, surpassing the high the state had set last week. The state’s virus hospitalizations remained unchanged from a day earlier at 1,257. There are 533 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state. The department reported there are 21 available ICU beds in Arkansas, though it’s not clear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients. Last week the state ran out of ICU beds for virus patients, though availability has slightly eased since then. The state’s COVID-19 death toll rose Monday to 6,912 since the pandemic began. It also added 882 new virus cases. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The Department of Health reported that the number of active cases among students and staff in the state’s public schools has grown to 3,684. Cabot, Fort Smith, Springdale, Rogers and Bentonville schools each reported more than 100 active cases.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Legislature on Monday voted to guarantee people can call out their bosses publicly in most harassment and discrimination cases. When companies settle complaints filed by their employees, the agreements often include a provision barring the employee from disparaging the company or talking publicly about what happened. These agreements came under fire during the #MeToo movement, criticized as shielding public figures and companies from responsibility in sexual harassment cases. California passed a law in 2018 that bans these nondisclosure agreements in cases involving sexual harassment, discrimination or assault. The Democratic-dominated Legislature voted Monday to expand that law to include other types of harassment and discrimination, including claims based on race, religion, gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who must decide whether to sign it into law. “No worker should ever be silenced from speaking out about their own experience of harassment or discrimination in the workplace,” said Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, author of the bill. “For far too long, these secret settlements and agreements have reinforced a culture of secrecy that prevents accountability, respect and justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A former police officer involved in the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia should stand trial for assault, a judge ruled Monday. District Judge Michelle Brinegar said there is probable cause for the charge against former Loveland police Officer Austin Hopp, who will be arraigned in late September, the Loveland Reporter-Herald reports. Hopp arrested Karen Garner in June 2020 after she left a store without paying for about $14 worth of items. His body camera footage shows him catching up to the woman as she walks through a field along a road. Gardner, now 74, shrugs and turns away from him, and he quickly grabs her arm and pushes her 80-pound body to the ground. A federal lawsuit filed on Garner’s behalf, which included images from the body camera footage, claims that Hopp dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of his patrol car and that she was denied medical treatment for about six hours. Former Loveland police Officer Daria Jalali is facing several charges stemming from the arrest, including failing to intervene in the use of excessive force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 1,500 long-term unemployed residents who recently found jobs are being awarded $1,000 bonuses under the first round of the Back to Work CT program, an initiative funded with federal COVID-19 relief funds. Approximately $10 million has been allocated for the program, which will provide bonus payments for up to 10,000 eligible applicants through Dec. 31. “Many workers who were displaced during the early months in the pandemic and faced long-term unemployment are now transitioning back into the workforce and starting to rebuild,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday in a statement. “This one-time bonus payment will help some of those workers pay for the critical things they need to get back to work, including childcare.” To be eligible for the program, applicants must obtain and maintain a full-time job for eight consecutive weeks between May 30 and Dec. 31. Applicants must complete and submit an application electronically to the Department of Revenue Services.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A state trooper who received several traffic commendations has been indicted for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme in which at least two of his victims were fellow law enforcement officers, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9, was charged with misdemeanor and felony tampering with public records; issuing a false certificate, a felony; and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison. Delaware State Police contacted prosecutors in May, according to the justice department, after an internal review found “a serious pattern of fraudulent E-Warnings” by Ramirez. The review began April 30 after one of his supervisors found discrepancies in an accident report, prosecutors said. Ramirez was immediately suspended. According to the indictment, after finding the discrepancy, the supervisor began looking at Ramirez’s activity and compared instances in which E-Warnings and E-Tickets were issued to dashcam footage to determine whether the stop had occurred and if so, what had been issued. In April alone, Ramirez issued more than 30 fraudulent warnings, according to the justice department. In some cases, motorists were not informed of the warnings. In other instances, a traffic stop never happened.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Landon Collins, safety for the Washington Football Team, took some time away from the field Monday to bring joy to young football players, WUSA-TV reports. Collins surprised players at the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation’s Woodbridge Warriors Youth Football Team at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Northeast D.C. Each member of the team got a $150 Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card to use however they wanted. Collins served as their personal shopping consultant. The kids, surprised and excited to spend time with the star player, grabbed new shoes and other football gear. “It just feels great for him to come down here and spend his time with us, just so we can have a surprise and get us ready,” one player said Collins said the opportunity to spend time with the kids was a blessing. “Being around these kids to give them a smile on their face and to put something on their shoulders that they can use on and off the football field is amazing,” Collins said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State education officials on Monday began to make good on threats to withhold funding from school districts that defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on mask mandates, despite a circuit judge last week ruling the ban unconstitutional. Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced that the Florida Department of Education has withheld an amount equal to monthly school board member salaries in Alachua and Broward counties, as directed by the State Board of Education. Funds will continue to be withheld until the districts comply, Corcoran said. Broward County Interim Superintendent Vickie Cartwright said in a statement that Broward County School Board believes it is in compliance with the law. “The health and safety of our students, teachers and staff continue to be our main priorities,” Cartwright said. “As such, BCPS (Broward County Public Schools) will continue to mandate masks, knowing the data shows they help minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our schools.” DeSantis, a Republican who is eyeing a possible presidential run in 2024, had been threatening to impose financial penalties on school boards for weeks. Democratic President Joe Biden has said if that happened, federal money would be used to cover any costs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers will use the same guidelines as in 2010 to redraw congressional, legislative and other electoral districts, meaning lawmakers are not required to give members of the public an advance look at the plans, nor consider whether districts give candidates from different political parties a meaningful chance to win. Identical guidelines were presented to both House and Senate redistricting committees Monday. The House voted to adopt the guidelines, while senators gave preliminary agreement, with a final vote likely on the first day of a special session expected in October or November. Asked about whether maps would be released in advance, Senate Majority Leader John Kennedy emphasized the shortened time period because of delays in U.S. census data stemming from COVID-19. In 2010, state legislative maps were unveiled the Friday before the redistricting special session began. “We’re obviously operating under a very short period of time compared to what they had to this previously,” said Kennedy, R-Macon. Advance notice of maps is one of the key objectives for which outside groups have been lobbying. “Georgians need to have access to the maps and know how and when the maps will be presented,” said Jerry Gonzalez, CEO of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care officials are concerned about a shortage of oxygen as the state’s coronavirus surge continues to grow. Hospital officials are canceling nonemergency procedures that require oxygen in an attempt to conserve supplies, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There is a global shortage of oxygen containers that are needed for transport to the islands, said Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a trade group for the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “The combined demand has increased to the point where we are concerned about whether we can generate enough oxygen in Hawaii to meet all the needs of our health care facilities,” Raethel said. Hawaii’s two oxygen plants have switched to producing medical gas only. Raethel said mainland tank orders are backlogged for months. Hawaii Pacific Health, which oversees several hospitals in the state, directed staff to cancel elective procedures where oxygen is needed. “We do not plan to defer any emergency surgery, and we will need to have careful consideration of cases that are urgent but not emergent,” Hawaii Pacific Health President and CEO Ray Vara said in a staff memo. “Any cases that can be deferred safely should be deferred until the oxygen supply solutions are clearer.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An environmental group that wants to end public-land grazing has outbid a rancher for a grazing lease on state land that includes habitat for bull trout and steelhead. Western Watersheds Project’s bid of $8,200 won the 20-year grazing lease on 620 acres in central Idaho’s Sawtooth Valley in Custer County. The group and the Idaho Cattle Association say it’s possible other state grazing leases could be sought by other environmental groups. Western Watersheds will also have to pay an annual $800 fee based on the number of sheep or cattle authorized for the allotment. “That’s still a screaming deal,” said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, noting that private-land grazing fees are about three times that much. “Certainly, at those prices, the parcel is a lot more valuable for conservation than it is for grazing livestock.” Molvar said the group will not graze livestock but instead convert the grazing lease into a conservation lease and allow the area to be used by wildlife, notably a herd of 50 pronghorn that frequent the area. Elk and bighorn sheep are also in the region. He also said sections of two streams running through the parcel, Fourth of July Creek and Champion Creek, will be protected. The new lease takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A white police officer has been placed on administrative duty as the city’s police oversight agency investigates his struggle with a Black woman who was walking her dog in a lakefront park. Police Superintendent David Brown on Monday directed that the officer be placed on paid desk duty while what happened over the weekend is investigated, the department said. Attorneys for the woman allege the encounter became violent and was an “obvious case of racial profiling.” The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said Monday that it reviewed the officer’s body camera video and recommended he either be placed on administrative duty or be relieved of his police power while it investigates. “If violations did occur, COPA will hold the officer accountable,” interim chief Andrea Kersten said. A law office representing Nikkita Brown said she was near the lakefront with her dog about 12:10 a.m. Saturday when a police officer approached her for being in the area after the park was closed. In a video recorded by a bystander, the woman and her dog appear to be walking away from the officer as he follows closely, and at one point she turns around with her phone in her hand and stops. Moments later, the officer appears to reach for her phone and then grabs Brown.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s health commissioner defended herself Monday against criticism arising from a photograph circulating on social media showing her not wearing a face mask during a wedding reception. Dr. Kristina Box said in a statement that she “made an informed decision” to take off her mask while dancing or talking at a recent family wedding with guests fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Box said all but five people at the wedding were fully vaccinated. Several social media comments called Box’s actions hypocritical, as she said Friday that Indiana had reached “the darkest time in the pandemic” amid a surge in infections and hospitalizations and urged more people to get COVID-19 shots and wear masks. The photo shows Box standing amid several people, none of whom are wearing masks. Box said in her statement that federal guidelines call for people to wear masks at indoor public places when in areas of “high or sustained transmission.” “I continue to wear my mask in these settings and encourage Hoosiers to do the same,” Box said. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb apologized in May 2020 after posing for a photo with two people in which none of the three wore masks inside a Brown County restaurant, a day after recommending mask-wearing.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A man was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday in the abduction and killing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, three years after she disappeared while out for an evening run. Judge Joel Yates’ sentence for Cristhian Bahena Rivera was mandatory for a first-degree murder conviction in Iowa, which does not have the death penalty. The 27-year-old former farmhand, who testified that he came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico as a teenager, has been jailed since his arrest in August 2018. Yates pointedly rejected defense claims that others were responsible for the crime. “Mr. Bahena Rivera, you and you alone forever changed the lives of those who loved Mollie Tibbetts,” he said. The sentence caps a case that inflamed anger over illegal immigration, fueled fears about violence against solo female runners, and took several noteworthy twists during and after Bahena Rivera’s trial in May. Tibbetts’ mother, Laura Calderwood, addressed Bahena Rivera in a victim impact statement read to the court. “Mollie was a young woman who simply wanted to go for a quiet run on the evening of July 18 and you chose to violently and sadistically end that life,” she wrote.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Former Gov. Jeff Colyer announced Monday that he is dropping out of the 2022 race for governor after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. “While I have always focused on helping others, for the next few weeks I am going to focus on my health,” said Colyer, a physician who served as governor for a little less than a year in 2018. In his announcement, Colyer said he was endorsing Attorney General Derek Schmidt in the governor’s race. Colyer had been Schmidt’s main rival for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s reelection. Schmidt wished Colyer “all the best in overcoming his current health challenges” in a statement and said that “now is the time to come together to elect a Republican governor for Kansas next year.” In a tweet, Kelly wished Colyer “a quick recovery.” “Colyer and I may have our disagreements. But one thing we can all agree on: the need to defeat cancer,” she wrote on Twitter. Colyer was elevated from lieutenant governor in January 2018, when GOP Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Colyer narrowly lost the 2018 Republican primary to polarizing conservative Kris Kobach, who alienated moderate GOP and independent voters and lost to Kelly that November.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The governor signaled Monday that he wants to convene a special legislative session to deal with COVID-19 issues once a “general consensus” is reached on what can be achieved. Gov. Andy Beshear said the special session needs to happen soon in part to maintain the state of emergency he declared at the outset of the pandemic in Kentucky. And there are pressing coronavirus-related issues stemming from school closures due to surging outbreaks, he said. The governor has the authority to call lawmakers into special session and to set the agenda. Beshear, a Democrat, has had discussions with leaders of the Republican-led Legislature over what actions could be taken if lawmakers are brought back to the statehouse. Those negotiations come as Kentucky suffers its worst surge of virus cases and hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Various emergency measures previously issued by Beshear are set to expire as a result of a recent landmark court decision. It’s up to lawmakers to decide whether to keep them in place. Kentucky had more new cases of COVID-19 last week than any other week in the pandemi, and on Monday reported another record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients. The highly contagious delta variant is spreading fastest among school-age Kentuckians, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A storied jazz site where a young Louis Armstrong once worked toppled when Ida blew through the state as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S. The Karnofsky Tailor Shop, where a Jewish family employed Armstrong, collapsed Sunday during the storm. Armstrong would play a small tin horn as he worked on the coal and junk wagons, according to the National Park Service. The business opened downtown in 1913 and had a residence above it where the late jazz legend would often eat meals. The family, who provided Armstrong a “second home,” lent him money to buy his first cornet. “Louis said it was the Karnofskys that instilled the love of singing in his heart,” jazz historian and retired photojournalist John McCusker said, according to WWL-TV. Morris Karnofsky, the family’s son and Armstrong’s childhood friend, opened the city’s first jazz record shop on that same street, according to the park service. Armstrong would visit Morris Music when he returned to New Orleans after moving away. When daylight came Monday morning, all that was left was a pile of bricks and other remnants of the historic site.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lobster fishing industry will face a host of new harvesting restrictions amid a new push from the federal government to try to save a vanishing species of whale. The new rules, which have loomed over the profitable lobster industry for years and were announced Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are designed to protect the North Atlantic right whale. The whales number only about 360 and are vulnerable to lethal entanglement in fishing gear. NOAA said it expects the new rules will result in a nearly 70% reduction of the risk of death and serious injuries the whales can suffer from entanglement. The rules had long been expected to focus on reducing the number of vertical ropes in the water, and they will. The rules reduce the number of rope lines that link buoys to lobster and crab traps, NOAA said. The rules will also require the use of weaker ropes so whales can more easily break free if they do become entangled, the agency said. NOAA said the rules also expand the areas of ocean where fishing with trap rope is prohibited or limited. Members of the lobster fishing industry have said strict new rules could make it difficult to get lobsters to consumers.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Organizers of the 80th National Folk Festival say they’re adding a fourth stage at this year’s festival, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Stage. The festival is slated to return to downtown Salisbury on Sept. 10-12 for the third year of its residency in the Eastern Shore city. Supported by Maryland Traditions, the traditional arts program of the Maryland State Arts Council, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Area & Stage at the 80th National Folk Festival celebrates and showcases the rich, living traditions of Maryland. The area shines a spotlight on the distinctive music, rituals, crafts, occupations, foodways and other traditions at the heart of Maryland heritage, expressing both the state’s deep history and its evolving character. Performances, demonstrations, displays, exhibits, and narrative presentations by Maryland master artisans and performers explore a wide range of cultural traditions, including those of its First Peoples, the cultural legacies of European settlers, and the expressions of the newest Maryland residents whose cultural roots come from around the globe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Hundreds of students at Amherst College are pushing back against what they call the school’s overly restrictive coronavirus protocols that include double-masking indoors, restrictions on off-campus activities, and no in-person campus dining. In a letter sent to President Carolyn “Biddy” Martin a week ago, the students said that “the guidelines are not based on any given data, have been developed without student input, are significantly stricter than our peer institutions, and are in conflict with (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines.” The restrictions originally announced Aug. 24 and designed in response to the spread of the delta variant apply to the first two weeks of the fall semester, which began Monday. The prestigious private liberal arts college celebrating its 200th anniversary this year had already mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. In response to the pushback, Martin wrote another campuswide email Aug. 27. “We are in the midst of a surge, and you are arriving on campus from all over the country and the world, including from delta hotspots,” she said, adding later: “Now is not yet the time to relax key restrictions.” She did, however, amend a near-universal outdoor mask mandate, calling it “unworkable.”\n\nMichigan\n\nRoyal Oak: Some animals are rolling up their fur for COVID-19 shots at the Detroit Zoo. The zoo in suburban Detroit said its gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers and lions are getting a vaccine developed by Zoetis, a veterinary drug company, and authorized by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Other animals will follow. “We’re both thankful and relieved a special vaccine is now available to protect against COVID-19,” said Scott Carter, the zoo’s chief life sciences officer. “The animals routinely get other vaccinations.” The zoo said no COVID-19 infections have been found in its animals. Anti-vaccine advocates have aggressively criticized other zoos nationwide that have administered the shots to their animals. But the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has said it supports the animal vaccines, which “have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state has reached 300 traffic accident deaths before Labor Day for the first time in more than a decade, prompting state public safety officials on Monday to issue a plea for people to slow down. The state reported its 300th fatality Saturday – the earliest the state has eclipsed that threshold since 2007, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Office of Traffic Safety. There were 240 traffic deaths in the state at this time last year, and the state did not reach 300 until October. Officials attributed 103 of the deaths, or about 40%, to speeding, compared to 78 at this time last year. “This many preventable deaths on Minnesota roads before Labor Day is completely unacceptable,” said Office of Traffic Safety Director Mike Hanson. “It’s not a homework assignment; you don’t get a do-over. We all need to drive smart to keep our family, friends and neighbors alive.” Nearly three-fourths of all victims were male, with the majority between 21 and 30 years old. Alcohol-related deaths stand at 74, which is down from 88 at this time last year and 136 in 2011. Drunken driving-related deaths comprised 20% of all traffic fatalities in 2020 compared to more than half in the 1960s. State officials say the lower numbers are due in large part to extra impaired driving enforcement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he is feeling well, less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. “To everyone who has asked, I have recovered fully from my bout with COVID-19, and I have a clean bill of health,” Wicker posted on Twitter. “I am looking forward to resuming my travel in the state this week.” Wicker, 70, is one of three senators who announced Aug. 19 that they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Wicker, independent Sen. Angus King, 77, of Maine, and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, 69, of Colorado, had all been fully vaccinated. All three have recommended that people get their shots. Wicker wrote Tuesday: “Being fully vaccinated greatly reduced my risk of developing severe complications from the virus. Getting the shot is safe, easy, and free, and it could save your life.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge on Tuesday refused to reinstate federal unemployment benefits that were cut in June when Gov. Mike Parson pulled out of several programs, saying the court “would not substitute its judgment” for that of the governor. The ruling by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem came a day after lawyers representing Missouri residents who lost the jobless benefits asked for reinstatement with back pay that, for some people, could have amounted to $1,500. The enhanced benefits from several federal programs added money to the unemployment checks for out-of-work Americans to help ease the crunch caused by shutdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic. But some Republican governors, including Parson, ended the benefits, saying they wanted to prod people to rejoin the workforce. In his four-page ruling denying a preliminary injunction, Beteem wrote that “the balancing of harms and the public interest strongly favor the Governor’s decision to promote economic recovery and encourage workers’ re-entry into Missouri’s critically understaffed labor force.” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that the ruling “affirmed the legality of Governor Parson’s decision to terminate these temporary benefits and will hopefully lead to the hiring of workers for businesses that desperately need the help.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has announced a rule encouraging schools to give parents final say on whether children should wear masks in schools, after several large school districts implemented mask requirements for all students. Gianforte, a Republican, made the announcement Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Education on Monday opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions. Gianforte said in a statement that masking in schools, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, is “based on inconclusive research.” He also said masking could have adverse impacts on children’s “health, wellbeing and development.” The CDC issued its guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The rule says schools should consider “parental concerns” when adopting mask mandates and provide parents the ability to opt out of health-related mandates for a wide array of reasons including physical and mental health, developmental needs, religious beliefs and moral convictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state has increased in each of the past ten weeks, and the total nearly doubled over the past two weeks as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread. Nebraska reported 5,006 new cases for the week ending Friday, according to an Omaha World-Herald analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from 3,755 the previous week and nearly double the 2,668 cases recorded the week before. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has also risen over the past two weeks from 190 new cases per day Aug. 15 to 715.14 new cases per day Sunday. “Those numbers speak for themselves,” said Dr. James Lawler, a co-executive director of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security. “We’re going up, and we’re following in the footsteps of the Southern states that saw increasing cases before us. And we’ll continue that way unless something dramatic happens.” The state said 323 people were hospitalized with the virus in the state as of Thursday. Last week, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered all the state’s hospitals to delay elective surgeries, if possible, to help free up capacity, but he resisted taking other measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials say they’ll use a $50,000 grant from the National Park Service to fund research about five decades of segregation, civil rights activism and advocacy in the historic West Las Vegas neighborhood. An announcement Monday said the project aims to focus on the years 1930 through 1979 in what amounted to the city’s segregated Black community. The goal is to determine what buildings and properties could be included on the National Register of Historic Places and listed on the city’s Historic Property Register. The funds to Las Vegas are part of nearly $750,000 nationwide allocated under the park service’s Underrepresented Community Grant Program, the city statement said. The city Historic Preservation Office submitted the grant request, and the city will issue a request for proposals for contracts with experienced cultural resources consultants to prepare the survey and inventory.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A milestone anniversary for the New Hampshire Film Festival is again being pushed back a year due to COVID-19. Announced Monday, the 20th annual NHFF will have to wait another year because of the pandemic. The celebration was originally scheduled for October 2020, then delayed to October 2021. Now it’s planned for 2022. An autumn tradition in Portsmouth, which has hosted the festival since 2004 after its debut in Derry three years before, the festival said it would be unable to keep up with new health and safety protocols seen in art venues and community events across the country “due to the scale and scope” of an event spread across several days and multiple venues. “We are upset to find ourselves in this extremely difficult position, but our deeper concern lies with the filmmakers, attendees, supporters, partners and sponsors who continue to struggle with the ongoing pandemic,” NHFF executive director Nicole Gregg said in a statement. Celebrating newer filmmakers and directors, as well as more experienced screenwriters and actors, the NHFF is a four-day fall event that typically draws crowds for film showings, question-and-answer sessions with film producers and actors, and receptions and parties at downtown restaurants.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: A young lifeguard was killed, and seven other people, including three other lifeguards, were injured when lightning struck a Jersey Shore beach Monday afternoon, authorities said. It marked the second death of a young lifeguard at the Jersey Shore in a little over a week. Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy said the others were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. “Our hearts are with the family and friends of the young lifeguard killed by today’s horrific lightning strike on the beach in Berkeley Township, and we pray for a full recovery for those injured,” Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter. “I’ve spoken to Mayor Carmen Amato and offered the full support and assistance of our administration during this difficult time.” Amato said his township’s beaches will be closed Tuesday through Thursday as crisis counselors are made available to beach staff and lifeguards. Four of those struck were lifeguards, and four others were beachgoers. “This is a tragic and heartbreaking day for our town and the entire Jersey Shore,” Amato said in a statement. “This young person was out there every day protecting the lives of others. Our lifeguard teams, like so many along the shore, develop special connections with our community throughout the summer, which makes this loss even greater.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric provider wants to transfer its share of a coal-fired power plant to an energy company backed by the Navajo Nation, but environmentalists argue that approving the deal would prolong the life of the plant and run counter to New Mexico’s renewable energy goals. The state Public Regulation Commission will determine whether Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s plan for Four Corners Power Plant is in the public interest during a two-week hearing that began Tuesday. It heard from the public Monday. Some of those who spoke at the virtual meeting Monday choked back tears when talking about pollution emitted by the plant over the decades, while others spoke about how their jobs at the power plant and coal mine helped to put their children through college. Some tribal members told regulators that all levels of Navajo leadership are behind the proposal. They said allowing the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to take over the utility’s stake in Four Corners would provide more time for the tribe to find ways to deal with significant economic consequences that will come when the plant closes in 2031. If regulators don’t approve PNM’s plan, the Navajo Nation could lose up to $60 million annually, said LoRenzo Bates, former speaker of the Navajo Nation Council.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Resigning from office probably didn’t end former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s legal problems, and no matter what happens next, taxpayers are likely to wind up with a hefty bill. The state has already agreed to pay up to $9.5 million to lawyers representing and investigating Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, according to a review of available contracts. That figure represents the maximum amount that could be spent, not actual bills submitted so far. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee. His successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, can decide whether the state will continue to pay lawyers to defend Cuomo and his administration going forward. Cuomo and the administration face the possibility of civil lawsuits from women who have accused the Democrat of sexual harassment. The state attorney general is looking into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote. Federal prosecutors are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. He’s also facing a state ethics commission inquiry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill Monday that would do away with the permit someone must obtain from a county sheriff before buying a pistol, turning back a key agenda item of conservative gun rights supporters. Cooper’s veto was expected, and an override will be difficult for Republicans who control the General Assembly, since they lack veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Only two Democrats – both in the House – voted for doing away with the pistol purchase permitting system, which goes back more than 100 years. Cooper supports more gun-sale restrictions, not less, and his office expressed his opposition to the bill the day after the final legislative vote this month. “Gun permit laws reduce gun homicides and suicides and reduce the availability of guns for criminal activity,” Cooper said in a news release Monday. “At a time of rising gun violence, we cannot afford to repeal a system that works to save lives. The legislature should focus on combating gun violence instead of making it easier for guns to end up in the wrong hands.” Bill supporters said the current process has become duplicative with the comprehensive national checks that licensed gun dealers must conduct. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association backed the repeal this year after opposing it previously.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit by the state of Missouri seeking to stop a project that would supply Missouri River water to central North Dakota. The Bismarck Tribune reports the ruling will enable the federal Bureau of Reclamation to move ahead with a water service contract for the Central North Dakota Water Supply Project. The project will receive water from the McClusky Canal for systems in Burleigh, Sheridan, Wells, Foster, Kidder, McLean and Stutsman counties. The Missouri suit alleged violations of federal policy, including failure by project developers to properly study the project’s environmental impacts and its alternatives. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled against Missouri on all counts. The state of Missouri “doesn’t like any depletion from the Missouri River,” said Merri Mooridian, deputy manager of the Red River Valley Water Supply Program, which will move Missouri River water by underground pipeline from Washburn east to supply systems in the east and central parts of the state. The Central North Dakota Water Supply Project will use the same pipeline, taking nearly 13 million gallons a day. “The state of North Dakota has the right to flows of the Missouri River in the state of North Dakota,” Mooridian said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Common Pleas judge has rescinded his order that a man sentenced for a felony drug charge get vaccinated against COVID-19 within two months as a condition of his probation. Speaking at a hearing Tuesday, Judge Christopher Wagner told Brandon Rutherford that it’s not a judge’s role to make decisions for him or “teach you to be a better person.” The reversal came nearly a month after Wagner had sentenced Rutherford. At the time, Wagner told Rutherford he presumed he hadn’t been vaccinated because he was wearing a mask in court, which Rutherford confirmed, telling the judge he wasn’t worried about the vaccine. Neither Rutherford nor his attorney, Carl Lewis, objected to the vaccination order during the sentencing, but soon afterward Rutherford expressed concerns about the directive. Lewis said Tuesday that his 21-year-old client has concerns about the vaccine and will not get it within two months. Lewis had argued that a judge doesn’t have the power or authority to order someone to be inoculated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that seeks to crack down on protesters is unconstitutional and would chill the ability of groups to mobilize people to advocate for racial justice, a civil rights group argues in a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma City, along with the national NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center. The lawsuit argues the law, which takes effect Nov. 1, was written to discourage peaceful demonstrations and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantee the right of the public to peacefully assemble and give citizens equal protection under the law. The new law increases the penalties for blocking roadways, grants motorists civil and criminal immunity if they kill or injure someone while fleeing from a riot, and authorizes hefty fines for national organizations that coordinate with those found guilty of committing crimes under the state’s rioting statutes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: City employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – or obtain a medical or religious exemption – by the middle of October, or they will be fired. “With COVID-19 filling hospitals and claiming lives, we must do everything within our power to end this pandemic and restore our community’s health,” Mayor Ted Wheeler and all four City Commissioners wrote Monday in a letter to municipal workers. The city will require its approximately 6,800 employees to submit proof of vaccination, show they are in the process of being vaccinated, or apply for an exemption by Sept. 10 and be fully vaccinated or granted an exemption by Oct. 18. Those who fail to meet the deadline “will be put on a list for separation from employment,” according to the letter. The city plans to provide a comprehensive outline of the new policy later this week and to answer whatever questions municipal workers might have. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that earlier this month, Multnomah County imposed a vaccine mandate on its employees, and Gov. Kate Brown has announced similar requirements for all teachers, health care workers and state employees across Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Masks will be required in all public and private schools, as well as child care facilities, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday, reversing course amid a statewide COVID-19 resurgence that is filling hospital beds just as students return to class. The Department of Health order will take effect Tuesday, Sept. 7 – a week or more after the start of school in many districts – and will require students, teachers and staff to wear masks when inside, regardless of vaccination status, the Wolf administration said. The order will not apply to student-athletes while they’re playing, nor to outdoor activities. “Wearing a mask in school is necessary to keep our children in the classroom and to keep COVID out of that classroom,” Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association said the decision on masking should have been left to local school officials, but it would nevertheless remind school districts “of their legal obligation related to the directive.” Less than a month ago, Wolf had ruled out a statewide mask mandate for schools after requiring them last year. But the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has changed the administration’s calculus about what is needed to keep students in class.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The union that represents nurses at the state’s only Level 1 trauma hospital is calling on its parent company to increase the pay of nurses who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nurses and Allied Professionals union on Tuesday delivered a petition with more than 2,000 signatures to Lifespan Corp., which operates Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Lifespan, the state’s largest health care organization, has already increased compensation for nurses at some of its other hospitals. “We provide a critical component of patient care in Rhode Island, yet during this unprecedented health crisis, Lifespan seems to have forgotten about us,” Frank Sims, a Rhode Island Hospital nurse and union president, said in a statement. “While the nurses at Miriam Hospital and Newport Hospital are being recognized for their front line service with appropriate compensation increases during this crisis, Lifespan has refused to do the same for Rhode Island Hospital nurses.” A Lifespan spokesperson said the system provides nurses with “highly competitive wage and benefits packages.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A private college is allowing men to live on campus for the first time since it was founded 167 years ago. About 45 men moved into a dorm set aside for them at Columbia College this month, media outlets report. College officials said last year that they decided to bring men to what had been an all-women college because enrollment had fallen 25% in the past decade. “Most women now are looking for a co-educational experience. Also, we really believe the opportunity that we provide and the environment we have is a good one for men to grow. And so it’s expanding our outreach to men of course but also to a broader group of women,” said Columbia College President Tom Bogart, who took over as leader of the school in October. Jordan Wright was one of the first men to move into the Columbia College dorms. “I feel like it’s a good experience,” Wright said. “It’s a new beginning and new blessings. I know it’s a little different now, but I feel like everything is still going to go good with the boys and girls, even though it’s a new thing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday that she has activated nine soldiers from the state National Guard to help with coronavirus testing in the western part of the state amid a surge of infections. “This past week, I had conversations with all three South Dakota hospital systems and asked them what they needed as cases start to rise again,” she said in a statement. “Monument asked for the National Guard to assist them in their testing efforts, and we are happy to help.” Over the past two weeks, the average number of infections has tripled statewide. The western part of the state has been the hardest-hit, with Meade County, which hosted the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally earlier this month, leading the state in new cases per capita. The Department of Health reported last week that it had traced 63 cases among rallygoers. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide reached 216 – the largest number since January. Two deaths were also reported Tuesday, bringing the total death toll of people with COVID-19 in the state to 2,069. The health department said Pennington County had more than twice as many new COVID-19 cases in the prior day than any other county in the state. Noem activated the National Guard last year to prepare field hospitals for a surge in patients, but the hospitals were not utilized.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that notoriously blocked a federal dam project in the state decades ago, should no longer be on the endangered species list, federal officials announced Tuesday. Arguing that the fish is no longer in danger of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun the process to delist the species, a move backed by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has favored lifting protections for the fish since 2019. “Thanks to the persistence of many people, the extinction of the snail darter was ultimately avoided, and today we can celebrate its recovery,” said Zygmunt Plater, the attorney who wrote the citizens’ petition to save the snail darter in 1975. Snail darters, a member of the perch family, grow up to 3.5 inches long and mostly eat freshwater snails. Shortly after the passage of the landmark 1973 Endangered Species Act, construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Tellico Dam in eastern Tennessee threatened the habitat of the newly discovered fish, located just above the site of the project. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, marking the first time the nation’s highest court took up an ESA case. In 1978, the court ruled in favor of protections for the fish and halted work on the nearly completed dam. Congress later exempted the dam from the law to allow the project to be completed. But the TVA worked to transplant the snail darter to other rivers and streams.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The GOP-controlled Legislature passed a broad overhaul of the state’s election laws Tuesday, tightening already strict voting rules and dealing a bruising defeat to Democrats who waged a months­long fight over what they argued was a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will sign the bill, the latest in a national GOP campaign to add new hurdles to voting in the name of security, spurred in part by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election. Texas Democrats fought the legislation for months, arguing the bill was tailored to make it harder for young people, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – all Democratic-leaning voters – to cast ballots, just as they see the demographics shifting to favor their party. The bill specifically targets Democratic strongholds, including Houston’s Harris County, further tightening rules in a state already considered among the hardest places to cast a ballot. The legislation set off a heated summer in Texas of walkouts by Democrats, Republicans threatening them with arrest, Abbott vetoing the paychecks of thousands of rank-and-file staffers when the bill failed to reach him sooner, and accusations of racism and voter suppression. Even the final vote did not escape a parting round of confrontation after Senate Republicans, at the last minute, scuttled one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement: efforts to shield voters with felony convictions from prosecution if they did not realize they were ineligible to cast a ballot. It had been included following backlash over the arrests of two Texas voters, both of whom are Black.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox cast doubt on the efficacy of mask-wearing Tuesday as health leaders made some of their most impassioned pleas yet for Utahns to mask up and get vaccinated. Cox, a Republican, said his administration is encouraging people to wear masks but said it is unclear whether they are effective against the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. “Masks are not as effective as most of the pro-mask crowd are arguing,” Cox told reporters at a news conference. “We know that they’re just not.” Cox offered no specific evidence to support his assertion, and his comments contradicted public health experts, as well as statements Utah’s state epidemiologist Dr. Michelle Hofmann made a few minutes earlier at the same news conference. State hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to prevent the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. “There will be enduring harm to our children and generations to come if we do not stop the divisiveness around the things we know work like masks and vaccines,” Hofmann said. “We know the path to healing is the end of this pandemic, and it hasn’t ended yet even if we want to pretend it has.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Nearly all arriving students at the University of Vermont have been vaccinated against COVID-19. UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials are still working with fewer than 100 students to bring them into compliance with the school’s inoculation requirement. Earlier this month UVM reinstituted an indoor mask mandate for all faculty, staff, students and visitors on the Burlington campus. The exact size of this year’s school enrollment won’t be known for several weeks, but it’s expected to be more than 13,000. The incoming freshman class is expected to have about 3,000 students. “In wonderful news for the years ahead, an extraordinary new class of Catamounts have joined us this fall – with more than 25,000 applications for admission, the incoming class is on track to being the best academically prepared and the largest we’ve ever welcomed!” President Suresh Garimella said in a message to the student body. Students at colleges and universities across Vermont are returning for the fall semester amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, this time driven by the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons Tuesday to seven Black men who were executed in 1951 for the rape of a white woman, in a case that attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty. Northam announced the pardons after meeting with about a dozen descendants of the men and their advocates. Cries and sobs could be heard from some of the descendants after Northam’s announcement. The “Martinsville Seven,” as the men became known, were all convicted of raping 32-year-old Ruby Stroud Floyd, a white woman who had gone to a predominantly black neighborhood in Martinsville, Virginia, on Jan. 8, 1949, to collect money for clothes she had sold. Four of the men were executed in Virginia’s electric chair Feb. 2, 1951. Three days later, the remaining three were also electrocuted. All of them were tried by all-white juries. It was the largest group of people executed for a single-victim crime in Virginia’s history. At the time, rape was a capital offense. But Northam said Tuesday that the death penalty for rape was applied almost exclusively to Black people. Northam said the pardons are an acknowledgement that the men did not receive due process and faced racial bias.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The coronavirus pandemic is filling hospitals at an “alarming” rate and continuing to strain health care workers, state health officials said Monday. And for the first time during the pandemic, hospitals are also seeing large numbers of sick pregnant patients, said Dr. Tanya Sorensen, the executive medical director of women’s health at Swedish Health Services. She noted pregnant patients are generally less likely to be inoculated against COVID-19. “We’re seeing ICU admissions, maternal deaths, babies born prematurely either to help the mother breathe or rescue the baby,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking. … Pregnant women need to be vaccinated.” As of Monday morning, the state’s hospitals and health care centers were treating 1,570 COVID-19 patients, Washington State Hospital Association CEO Cassie Sauer said. Of those, 188 were on ventilators. Eleven days ago, the hospital association had counted 1,240 patients with 152 on ventilators. “It’s an enormous stress on a health care system to have this many patients with a single diagnosis,” she said. “This doesn’t happen. … It’s very, very alarming.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A historic suspension bridge will be undergoing major repairs, but it’s not clear whether the span will reopen to traffic. The West Virginia Division of Highways and Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday that a $17.9 million contract had been awarded to repair and rehabilitate the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register reports. The project will make repairs on the span’s superstructure and substructure as well as clean, paint, replace damaged suspension cables and renovate lighting, officials said. “It is absolutely fantastic news for the city of Wheeling to know that its most iconic structure, the suspension bridge, is going to be fully repaired and rehabilitated,” Mayor Glenn Elliott said Monday. The future of the historic 1849 bridge was in question after officials closed the span to vehicle traffic in 2019 since motorists repeatedly ignored Division of Highways weight restrictions and warnings on the structure. Multiple overweight vehicles tried to cross it, leading to damage, and it’s unclear whether the repairs will allow the bridge to reopen to traffic. After the contractor begins work on the bridge, crews will determine the extent of the damage, and officials will then determine how the bridge will be used going forward.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: A school district has reversed a decision to leave a federal free meals program following widespread criticism and loud protests from parents and others. Waukesha school board members said they received threats in the wake of national attention after voting to opt out of the program that was providing free breakfast and lunch to all students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The board voted 5-4 on Monday to reverse course, with parents and others packing the meeting room and two overflow rooms. Board member Karin Rajnicek said after the board’s previous vote to end the free program that it made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Even without the program, Waukesha students from low-income families still would have been able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more coronavirus-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: More staff than inmates at the state’s men’s prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past month, the Department of Corrections said late last week. Since July 23, the state has reported 43 cases of COVID-19 among staff at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins and the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution in Torrington. A total of 20 inmates in those two facilities tested positive for the virus over the same period of time. “Historically, we’ve had far more positives in our inmate population, as a percentage of the population, than we’ve had for staff,” Wyoming Department of Corrections spokesperson Paul Martin said Wednesday. “I think that trend is changing now.” About 35% of prison employees report being fully vaccinated, compared to 64% of inmates, the agency said. Vaccinations are not required for anyone, Martin told the Casper Star-Tribune, but are offered to employees and inmates. Inmates are still wearing face coverings and social distancing, Martin said. The only facility that did not experience an outbreak during the peak of the pandemic was the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk. This month, the women’s prison has reported five cases among staff and 11 among inmates.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}]}

Your funds don't get to the account for three days unless you pay a 1% fee to speed it up.\n\nHow it works: Link to your debit or credit card or bank routing and account number and pay friends electronically. Note: All payments are, by default, set to “public” so that everyone on the Venmo social network can see who you’re paying and what you’re buying unless you change the setting to friends only or private.\n\nWhat it says: “Venmo is designed for payments between friends and people who trust each other.\"\n\nWhat it doesn’t tell you: Every time you make a transaction on Venmo, it shares personal information with third-party firms. In our case, it sent our GPS location information and the name of the person we interacted with to data firms Braze, GIF sticker maker Holler.io and anti-fraud company Pinpoint Secure Data Collector.\n\nComment: “Venmo’s publicly available privacy policy and user agreement outline that we may share certain data with third-party service providers who assist us with parts of our business operations and providing services to users.”\n\nOur grade: Venmo is incredibly easy and convenient to use, and many people love it. But because it doesn’t respect the privacy rights of customers and because all transactions are by default sent to public, we give Venmo a D.\n\nFine print:Data privacy: Why Venmo sent my personal info – and yours – to Braze\n\nLook out:Venmo scams: How to use a payment app without getting ripped off\n\nCash App\n\nWhat it is: A payment app owned by Square, which many small merchants use to process retail purchases.\n\nNumbers: 24 million monthly customers\n\nCost: Free, but when people pay you, it takes 1-3 business days for the money to go into your account. One-day payments cost 1.5% of the transaction.\n\nHow it works: You need a debit card to link your account to Cash, or Bitcoin, to make payments. From the app, you can also invest in stocks or buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nWhat it says: Cash is \"the easiest way to send money, spend money, save money, and buy cryptocurrency.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: Customer service support can be an issue. Both the iOS and Google Play app stores have many low-rated reviews of Cash by customers frustrated over support issues. Cash sends customers to its Twitter support page or via a support menu in the app that takes you an e-mail option, with the promise of a reply within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity: Cash sent what it says was \"anonymized\" information about our test transaction to marketi companies.\n\nComment: The Cash app \"sometimes use third-party services to analyze anonymous data about app usage to help us fix bugs, identify app crashes, understand marketing campaigns, and improve the customer experience. These services are common in the industry and we choose products that are designed with customer privacy in mind.”\n\nOur grade: Easy to use, but if you don't have a debit card, you can't use Cash and dealing with customer service is not so smooth, so we give it a B.\n\nApple Pay Cash\n\nWhat it is: Apple's offer to pay people via iMessages.\n\nNumbers: Apple hasn't released any usage stats on the app.\n\nCost: Free.\n\nHow it works: First, you'll need an iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch and know that you can send money only to people who also have Apple devices. Setting up Apple Cash is more convoluted than others. Associate your debit card (banking account numbers won't work) with the app (found in the Apple Wallet app, on the home screen) and then you need to add cash to the account. At first. Then you can start making payments through Cash via your debit card.\n\nWhat it says: \"Sending money is as simple as sending a message. Use your debit card with just a touch of your finger or by asking Siri.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you:. If your friend uses a Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, you're out of luck. It works only on iOS.\n\nHow it makes money: It can take 1-3 days to transfer funds in Apple Cash to your bank account for free. Instant Transfers to a debit card charge 1% of the transaction.\n\nSecurity: Apple didn't share our information with third-party data firms.\n\nGrade: Great if you use iMessages and are on the Apple platform, not so if your friend has an Android phone. Also, setup is a pain. And some people may prefer to have their bank account linked instead of a debit card. Apple Cash gets a B.\n\nGoogle Pay\n\nWhat it is: Google's digital payment app that works on both Apple iOS and Android platform.\n\nNumbers: Google hasn't released usage numbers.\n\nCost: Free. Transfers take 1-5 days to receive funds from bank accounts. Google doesn't charge for \"instant\" transfers and makes money on credit card fees.\n\nHow it works: Download the app on iOS; it may come preloaded on your Android phone, and set it up with your debit and/or credit card. But you can only use debit for person-to-person transactions.\n\nWhat it says: \"Google Pay is the fast, simple way to pay online, in apps, and in stores. Plus, send money to friends, split bills, and cash in on loyalty and rewards – all without your wallet.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: That no app is easier to use for sending money. Hidden within Gmail, the most used free e-mail program, is a $ icon. Click it, and either pay or request money from a contact.\n\nSecurity: Google didn't share our transactions with any third parties.\n\nOur grade: For ease of us, working with debit and credit cards and banking accounts, better security than most and for the ability to pay via e-mail, we give Google Pay a B+.\n\nOur reservations: Google doesn't share the data with others, but now it knows even more about me – who I pay, what I buy and how often, and that feeds the Google monster in coming up with more personalized ads that I don't want to see.\n\nFacebook Pay\n\nWhat it is: The social network's vehicle to pay people from within the Messenger mobile app, or on desktop.\n\nNumbers: Facebook hasn't revealed usage stats.\n\nCost: Free. Like the others, it can take 1-5 days for the money to get credited to your bank. If you use PayPal with Facebook, you'll need to go into that app as well to transfer funds. Facebook makes money on credit card transactions.\n\nHow it works: Connect your credit or debit card, or PayPal account and start making payments by clicking the $ icon within Messenger. From there, friends can message you money as well that will be deposited to your account.\n\nWhat it says: \"Pay directly from your favorite apps,\" with icons of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: Only Facebook and Messenger offer it.\n\nSecurity: Facebook did not share our transactions with third-party data firms.\n\nOur grade: The app works flawlessly and if your friends have Facebook they can get paid or send you money. You're still giving too much information to Facebook (who you pay, where you both live, what you use the money for), but at least they're not sharing it with others. B+\n\nZelle (via Chase bank app)\n\nWhat it is: A bank consortium-owned app to make digital payments.\n\nNumbers: $187 billion in payments for 743 million 2019 transactions.\n\nCost: Free to use. Unlike the other apps, there isn't a hold on money transfers.\n\nHow it works: Sign up with your bank (partners include Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and most of the big banks) with your account and/or debit card info, and send money to others via your bank app, which runs Zelle in the background. People you pay will need to sign up to receive it. We tested Zelle with the Chase app. If you bank with BofA, Wells Fargo or other Zelle partners, you'll be paying with Zelle from within those apps.\n\nWhat it says: A \"fast, safe and easy way to send money in minutes with friends, family and others you trust.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: What exactly is Zelle? Still much less known and used than the other pay services, Zelle's actually available right within your bank account app and just requires the phone number or email address your friend has connected with the service – something they probably haven't yet set up. You never actually have to download a Zelle app.\n\nSecurity: Our transaction was sent to Zimperium, which provides \"enterprises with protection for mobile devices and apps against the next generation of mobile cyber attacks.\"\n\nComment: We asked Chase why it shared our information with a third party. The response: “JPMorgan Chase does not share or collect personally identifiable information (including location data) with any of the third-party providers that validate the integrity of our customers’ devices.\"\n\nOur grade: It's cool that Zelle doesn't charge for instant deposits and can be used without a debit card. And we like that partner Chase already knows our purchase history, so it's not like giving them more information. But using Zelle via the Chase app didn't seem as smooth and simple as apps like PayPal or Google Pay. We give that experience a B.\n\nPayPal Mobile Cash\n\nWhat it is: The original payment app created by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others back in 1999 and for years associated with eBay. It's now a separate company.\n\nNumbers: 300 million users\n\nCost: Peer-to-peer transactions are free but can take 1-3 business days to clear the bank. Instant transfer cost 1% in transaction fees.\n\nHow it works: Download the app, associate your credit/debit cards or banking information.\n\nWhat it says: \"With our improved app, you'll get the convenience you want, paired with the secure transactions you've come to trust from PayPal.\"\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you: That it shares your transaction data with data marketing firms.\n\nHow it makes money: Credit card and instant transfer fees.\n\nComment: We asked PayPal why it was sharing our data with these firms, and it declined to answer specifically.\n\nOur grade: Despite the passing on our data to other firms, which we don't like, PayPal's usage is smooth, reliable and works among so many platforms. Pro tip: Security researcher Patrick Jackson suggests using PayPal on computers or the mobile web, where data won't get shared with others, like on mobile apps. We give it a B+.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@Jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/11/50-worst-product-flops-of-all-time/36734837/", "title": "Product launch blunders: 50 worst flops of all time", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The day was darkened by a missile strike on an eastern Ukrainian train station which killed at least 22 people -- fulfilling warnings by Ukrainian officials.\n\nWhile previous years have been marked by celebrations and parades, Wednesday's commemoration comes exactly six months after Russia's invasion of the country began.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky marked the day with an emotional address that spoke of the Russian invasion as a new independence day -- the day Ukraine had to fight for its freedom, rather than simply voting for it at the ballot box.\n\n\"A new nation emerged on February 24 at 4 a.m. Not born, but reborn. A nation that didn't cry, didn't scream, didn't get scared. Didn't run away. Didn't give up. Didn't forget,\" Zelensky said Wednesday.\n\nHe added: \"Every new day is a new reason not to give up. Because, having gone through so much, we have no right not to reach the end. What is the end of the war for us? We used to say: Peace.

The US government joined the chorus of concern, telling Americans on Tuesday to leave the country immediately.\n\nOn Wednesday, those fears appeared to play out. Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, told CNN that Russia conducted \"missile strikes across Ukrainian territory.\"\n\n\"In other major cities of Ukraine, even those which are far away from the battlefield, there have been explosions, there have been missile strikes,\" Sak said, adding that Kyiv had at least eight air raid sirens on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chaplyne train station in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was hit in a strike, killing at least 22 people and wounding 50 more, Zelensky said later on Wednesday. An 11-year-old was among those killed in the strike.\n\n\"Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car.

He previously worked as an investigative reporter at the Moscow Tribune. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) On May 9 -- known as Victory Day in Russia -- President Vladimir Putin will need to make a bombastic and very public display to suggest he is winning the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut more than two months in, the war is going far from how Russia originally envisaged. May 9, then, might present Putin the occasion to declare a symbolic \"victory\" over Ukraine -- a great demonstration of patriotic ecstasy aimed at shoring up his manipulated, sanction-weary audience.\n\nThe date marks the day Nazi Germany surrendered to Soviet forces (the day after its capitulation to the Western allies, which is why the UK, US and their allies commemorate victory on May 8).\n\nMoscow initially partnered with Nazi Berlin to divide eastern Europe between the two totalitarian regimes. But after that partnership ended with the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, the Soviet human contribution to defeating Germany -- backed by enormous shipments of food aid and military equipment from the UK, US and Canada -- was critical.\n\nThe USSR lost tens of millions of soldiers and civilians in the course of the Second World War -- many of them in the then-Soviet republics of Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nOver the entirety of his regime, Soviet-leader Joseph Stalin killed more people both in his own country and in occupied territories than Adolf Hitler. But these days it is a crime in Russia to recall this history, or to compare the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union with those of Nazi Germany. Fresh flowers are still placed on Stalin's grave in Red Square -- where the May 9 victory parade is held.\n\nHow important is May 9 to Putin?\n\nVladimir Putin is an ultra-nationalist who does not believe Russia's territorial and political ambitions should end at its internationally recogniz​ed boundaries. The countries that used to make up the Soviet Union other than Russia are not considered sovereign by Russia -- by most Russians in fact , and especially by Putin.\n\nBut with no friendly tools to attract other countries available, to retain or regain an empire Russia needs a powerful army. May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time (over the years, all secretaries-general of the Communist Party similarly stood on Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square acknowledging Russia's military might with satisfaction as it drove past and flew over).\n\nUkraine is deeply personal to Putin (but, fortunately, for the future of Ukraine, even more personal to Ukrainians). Its \"waywardness\" is a betrayal and its very existence an historical aberration, in the eyes of the Russian President. Something had to be done about Ukraine's Western ambitions and as Russian style diplomacy (read: coercion) had failed, Putin felt forced to turn to more muscular methods to \"restore rightness.\"\n\nWhat he didn't realize​ (although nor, to be fair, did most Western analysts) was how fundamentally corrupted and incompetent Russia's supposedly modernize​d and professionalized fighting force had become.\n\nUkraine's heroic resistance deserves every credit. But they couldn't have achieved it without the Russians army's inadvertent help. Meanwhile, such is the vertical nature of Russia's political structures, there is surely little accurate information circulating among the rest of Putin's elites on the state of play.\n\nWhat could this mean for the course of the war?\n\nIf Western analysts are correct that Putin has demanded victory by Victory Day, this means Russia's military commanders need to achieve something -- anything -- after the humiliating defeats in the first two months of this war.\n\nThe attempt to take Kyiv was repelled, the Russian fleet's flagship cruiser has been sunk by a country effectively without a Navy, and they have lost at least 15,000 soldiers -- far more than in all previous post-Soviet campaigns (Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, Ukraine 2014) combined.\n\nRussia's Plan B (or more likely plan F or G) is to redouble efforts and ground forces and focus on taking more of Ukraine's east; and hopefully for the Kremlin, but far less likely, the rest of the Black Sea seaboard.\n\nWhether this can be done in time for the May 9 parade is highly debatable. Ukrainians are still receiving weaponry and morale is high -- although Kyiv controls the information surrounding the war and we do not know the real state of their armed forces. Its greatest challenge (from the east) is yet to come however, and the next few weeks will see intensified fighting as Russia tries to capture more land in Donbas.\n\nThe question remains, however, whether Moscow will seek to continue the offensive beyond its minor territorial gains or choose to \"freeze\" positions on the ground -- dig into Ukrainian territory and sue Ukraine for peace as the war enters a new, more static, phase. Recent attempts to destabilize Moldova through its Russian-controlled breakaway territory Transnistria remind us that Moscow won't give up so easily.\n\nBoth sides are effectively maneuvering for a better position at the negotiating table when that time eventually comes. In military terms, the war might be reaching a stalemate in the coming weeks, where neither side has sufficient force to completely change the tide of war and achieve a decisive victory over the other.\n\nWhat appears to be Putin's strategy in Ukraine?\n\nRussia's tactics may have changed, but its strategy -- that is to say its overall goal -- has not. That goal is to ensure that Ukraine is no longer an independent country able to make its choice to be European and westward-facing.\n\nThe good news is the objective cannot possibly be realized. Ukraine's subjugation -- physically or politically -- is forever beyond Russia's grasp now. Russia has not performed well enough on the battlefield or in the political arena to make it so. The bad news is that Russia does not yet know this and so will continue to send its own men, and far too many Ukrainians as well, to their deaths.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nRussia does at least know that this is not solely a war against Ukraine, but against the rules-based international order, which it has not profited from. Russia has been saying this for over a decade. NATO knows this, too, but refuses to publicly recognize​ this to help prevent it from getting dragged in (discussions with NATO in private are a different matter).\n\nIf sanctions are maintained, Europe can continue to wean itself off Russian energy, and if foreign investors remain deterred, the Kremlin will run out of money later in the year -- this in turn may dictate an eventual change of policy. But not by May 9. None of these changes will be visible by then -- in the \"progress\" of the war or in the eyes of ordinary Russians.\n\nSo May 9 will be a show of strength as it always is. But it will be hollow.

Western officials believe Putin could formally declare war on Ukraine as soon as May 9, a symbolic day for Russia, paving the way for him to step his campaign.\n\nWhat is May 9?\n\nMay 9, known as \"Victory Day\" inside Russia, commemorates the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nVictory Day is marked by a military parade in Moscow, and Russian leaders traditionally stand on the tomb of Vladimir Lenin in Red Square to observe it.\n\n\"May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time,\" said James Nixey, director of the Russia-Eurasia Programme at Chatham House told CNN.\n\nWestern officials have long believed that Putin would leverage the symbolic significance and propaganda value of the day to announce either a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities -- or both.\n\nThe Russian president has a keen eye for symbolism, having launched the invasion of Ukraine the day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, another crucial military day in Russia.\n\nRussian military vehicles at a parade rehearsal on April 28.\n\nPreparing for mobilization?\n\nPutin has many options on the table, according to Oleg Ignatov, senior analyst for Russia at Crisis Group. \"Declaring war is the toughest scenario,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- who has not formally declared war on Russia -- imposed martial law in Ukraine when the Russian invasion began in late February.\n\nAnother option for Putin is to enact Russia's mobilization law, which can be used to start a general or partial military mobilization \"in cases of aggression against the Russian Federation or a direct threat of aggression, the outbreak of armed conflicts directed against the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThat would allow the government not just to assemble troops but also to put the country's economy on a war footing.\n\nRussian servicemen at a parade rehearsal on April 28.\n\nRussian forces have lost at least 15,000 soldiers since the beginning of the war, according to Nixey, and reinforcements will be needed if Moscow is to achieve its goals in Ukraine.\n\nMobilization could mean extending conscription for soldiers currently in the armed forces, calling on reservists or bringing in men of fighting age who have had military training, said Ignatov.\n\nBut it would also represent a big risk for Putin.\n\n\"It would change the whole Kremlin narrative,\" said Ignatov, noting that the move would force Putin to admit that the invasion of Ukraine has not gone to plan. Full-scale mobilization could also damage the struggling Russian economy, he said.\n\nIn addition, it could diminish support for Putin at home, as some Russians support the invasion of Ukraine without wanting to personally go and fight, the analyst said.\n\n\"If they declare full-scale mobilization, some people wouldn't like it,\" said Ignatov.\n\nIt could still be possible for Putin to enact the mobilization law without officially declaring war on Ukraine, he said.\n\nPutin could also impose martial law in Russia, suspending elections and further concentrating power in his hands, Ignatov said.\n\nThis would impose rules such as restrictions on men of fighting age leaving the country, which could also prove unpopular, he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no chance\" Putin would declare war on May 9.\n\nWhat else could happen?\n\nIf Putin doesn't declare war, he may look elsewhere to make a statement to mark Victory Day.\n\nOther options include annexing the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, making a major push for Odesa in the south, or declaring full control over the southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nThere are also indications that Russia could be planning to declare and annex a \"people's republic\" in the southeastern city of Kherson.\n\n\"He (Putin) will be able to declare that the Russian army had some victories in Ukraine,\" said Ignatov. \"He can try to use this date to solidify his support.\"\n\nHowever it is hard to predict what Russia and its president will do, the analyst added.\n\n\"All the decisions are made by one man and a couple of his advisers,\" said Ignatov.\n\nYet US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday there is \"good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use\" May 9 for propaganda purposes.\n\n\"We've seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" Price said at a State Department briefing on Monday.", "authors": ["Jack Guy", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/sport/ukraine-athletes-coaches-deaths-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Ukraine: 133 athletes and coaches have died during the war, as the ...", "text": "(CNN) Thirty-one years ago, the Ukrainian Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union was issued, an occasion traditionally marked with celebrations and military parades in the streets of Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's Independence Day this year marks six months exactly since Russia invaded and began a bloody war which continues to rage across the country.\n\nAmong those who have been killed are 133 Ukrainian athletes and coaches, the Ukraine Ministry of Youth and Sports announced on Tuesday.\n\n\"The flag will no longer be raised and the anthem will no longer be played in honor of the sports victories of the deceased athletes,\" Minister of Youth and Sports Vadym Gutzait wrote.\n\n\"Russia invaded Ukraine and took their lives. 133 athletes and coaches have died on the battlefield and from enemy shelling.\"\n\nCNN is not able to independently confirm the number of deaths of Ukrainian athletes and coaches.\n\nThe website 'Sports Angels' details the lives of each sportsperson killed during the war -- some on combat missions, some in their homes destroyed by shelling.\n\nArcher Dmytro Sydoruk \"died defending Ukraine.\" After he was injured in 2014, Sydoruk represented Ukraine at the first ever Invictus Games -- an event for wounded soldiers founded by Prince Harry -- in 2017 and won a silver medal in archery.\n\nDmytro Sydoruk won a silver medal for Ukraine in the 2017 Invictus Games.\n\nHe was the coach of the national Invictus and Warrior Games, as well as a coordinator of the Invictus team in Lviv at the time of his death.\n\n\"He always tried to help all veterans who united around sports,\" Ukraine's Sports Committee said in a tribute.\n\n\"He passed on his skills to children in training, highly valued teamwork and veteran sports environment.\"\n\nIvan Bidnyak -- a former silver medalist at the European Shooting Championship -- was also killed while fighting in the Kherson region at the age of 36.

It was no coincidence that his invasion of Ukraine came a day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, a celebration of Russia's military achievements. It was on that same occasion in 2014 that Putin took the first step in annexing Crimea from Ukraine, through orchestrated pro-Russian protests on the peninsula.\n\nThe leader had clearly hoped to have more to celebrate by this Victory Day on Monday , the country's most patriotic of dates, marking the Soviet Union's role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II. It was on May 8, 1945, (May 9 in Moscow's time zone) that Germany signed its Instrument of Surrender in Berlin, ending the fighting in Europe. The USSR suffered the biggest losses of any nation -- around 27 million soldiers and civilians died.\n\nRussia's justification for war in Ukraine suggested a deadline for success by Victory Day. Putin and his government have repeatedly said the aim of their so-called \"special operation\" is to \"denazify\" Ukraine, and that freeing the country of Nazis is a matter of Russian survival. It's an argument that has no real weight; a blatant cover for Russian revanchism.\n\nEven though the Kremlin's well-oiled propaganda machine has been going at full steam since the February invasion, it will be difficult for Putin to twist Russia's losses into true victory on Monday.\n\nIf anything, the operation in Ukraine has been an embarrassment for him -- at least on the international stage.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attending the 2019 Victory Day military parade at Red Square in Moscow.\n\nRussia's military outsizes Ukraine's by every measure -- even with the heavy weapons the West is sending in -- yet it failed to take territory in the north, let alone the capital, Kyiv, and is struggling to make gains even in the east, where it is now focused.\n\nUkraine's armed forces claim that Russia has lost more than 24,000 troops in just over two months, and more than 1,000 tanks, over 2,600 armored vehicles and hundreds of aircraft. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers, and there are likely to be heavy losses on the Ukrainian side too. Still, it's undeniable that Russia military is weakened.\n\nRussia's guided-missile cruiser the Moskva -- once the crown jewel of its Black Sea fleet -- is now a wreck, sitting destroyed in the depths of the sea.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin's foes in the West, whom Russia had tried so hard to divide over years, are increasingly united, all for the cause of ensuring victory for Ukraine.\n\nEmily Ferris, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said that Russia's failures had been largely logistical.\n\n\"Some of the logistical problems they had were partly because they never really managed to take major railway hubs at all, frankly, in the whole country,\" Ferris told CNN. \"And because the Russian motorized ground forces rely on the railways to move all of their troops, their hardware and their tanks. Because they never really managed to control those hubs, they never really managed to push particularly far into Ukrainian territory, and it meant that they then had to rely on off-road capabilities.\"\n\nRussian forces instead moved by trucks and slow-moving tanks, many of which were bogged down in mud, as warmer weather prevented the ground from freezing and allowing freer movement, Ferris said.\n\n\"Then it meant that it was tricky to tow the tanks back to Russia for repairs, because they were far away, and so a lot of them were abandoned. Lots of their equipment started breaking because the tanks can only take so much moving around,\" she said. \"And, of course, you have the very well-documented resistance from local Ukrainians, who didn't take too well to being occupied.\"\n\nDestroyed and burned Russian tanks along a highway near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.\n\nEven in the east, where Russian forces are trying to advance through the Donbas region, their gains have been limited. Pro-Russian rebels have been installed in the self-declared separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk for years, but still, Russia hasn't annexed those areas, and its forces are struggling to get through a stiff Ukrainian resistance in big cities.\n\n\"We're still talking about huge amounts of territory -- Ukraine is massive -- even if they are just focusing on the east and the south. Some of the claims from senior commanders that they're going to be establishing a land corridor across the south of Ukraine, it's still a huge task,\" Ferris said. \"The fact that they've not been able to take major cities and major rail hubs before is still a problem. I think that's going to persist.\"\n\nAn alternate universe\n\nSitting in Russia, however, it's easy to think that the war is going to plan. Russian propaganda is flooding the media, which is almost entirely state-controlled, but in March the government also passed a law making \"false news\" about the military illegal, a crime that comes with a maximum 15-year jail term.\n\nAs a result, the antiwar protests that happened in Russia in the early weeks of the invasion have all but ended. And the media is largely complying with the new law.\n\nPolice officers detain a man during a protest against the conflict in Ukraine, in Manezhnaya Square in central Moscow on March 13, 2022.\n\nIndeed, Russia is pushing ahead with force. It's in the midst of a prolonged battle in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, where its forces are intensely shelling a huge steel plant that it has failed to seize. If the plant falls, the city is more or less in their hands.\n\nIntelligence reports show that Russia could be planning to annex Luhansk and Donetsk \"sometime in mid-May\" and could also declare and annex a so-called \"people's republic\" in the southeastern city of Kherson, according to US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Michael Carpenter, who spoke to reporters on Monday.\n\nAny advancements are amplified in Russian media, where the messaging of success is very clear, Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told CNN.\n\n\"The message is that Russia is moving according to plan and everything is going as it should, that there are some gains. Russia has declared that it took Mariupol, and so everything is going according to the plan,\" she said.\n\nThat messaging is filtering through to the Russian people effectively, according to Levada Center polls, which show that not only do the vast majority of Russians support the war, but 68% of Russians think the operation is proceeding successfully . Putin's popularity has also soared to 82% , after remaining stubbornly in the 60s since the Covid-19 pandemic hit right up until February, the month of Russia's invasion. Polling in Russia must be taken with a grain of salt, however, given people are subject to a stream of propaganda and dissent is not tolerated.\n\nStanovaya added that there was an additional narrative in state media that Russia is the victim in this war and that the country is acting defensively.\n\n\"When you're watching Russian TV for several days, you can really start believing that we are in a huge danger of Ukrainian Nazis. That we are vulnerable, that we should, we must get up and protect ourselves, otherwise it's a matter of Russian existence,\" she said.\n\nPutin doesn't even need to use Monday to declare any kind of victory, Stanovaya argued. He will just need to bank on the anti-Nazi emotions of the holiday to consolidate his justification for war.\n\nThe world waits\n\nAs Russians will be listening in on Putin's Victory Day speech, so too will global leaders and observers, eager to learn where Putin might take his war next. There has been much speculation, but as always with the Russian President, no one really knows.\n\nThere's a growing sense of nervousness that with so little to show the world -- if not Russians -- more than two months into the war, Putin may double down on his \"special operation.\"\n\nUK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace even suggested last week on a UK radio station that Putin may drop his guise of a \"special operation\" and outrightly declare war . Doing so could trigger a huge mobilization of Russian fighters, even civilian conscripts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday dismissed Wallace's suggestion as \"nonsense.\" But if Russia's military continues to deplete at the rate it is, it's not impossible that Putin will make that decision at some point.\n\nRussian service members marching on Red Square in central Moscow on May 9, 2021, to mark Victory Day.\n\nAndrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thinks Putin's original plan was to declare victory and an end to hostilities on Monday.\n\n\"But it is obvious that the war is dragging on, and Putin's plan is not getting any clearer. But he must make some symbolic or practical gesture,\" he said, speaking to CNN from Moscow.\n\n\"Everyone here is scared that he will announce a partial or full mobilization. Although such a measure might prove unpopular: the Russians have become militarists, but they are lazy militarists, sofa troops.\"\n\nWhile Victory Day is about World War II, it has also become a source of legitimacy for Putin, who has found ways to associate himself with the day, said Kolesnikov, who accuses the leader of simplifying the historical details and \"turning the celebration into a pompous ritual.\"\n\nIn the Putin years, the mythology around World War II has metamorphosized. Historians note it glorifies Soviet sacrifice, while downplaying Stalin's willingness to squander human lives. It glosses over the darkest chapters of the war: The USSR's pact with Nazi Germany that served as a prelude to war; the wholesale deportation of entire populations deemed untrustworthy by the Soviets; and mass rapes by Soviet soldiers in occupied Germany during the waning days of the war.\n\nEven a grassroots parade known as the \"Immortal Regiment\" to honor those who died in the war has been co-opted by the government. Putin now routinely leads marches himself. Stalin -- who refused to believe Adolf Hitler's army would invade the Soviet Union when it did --- is increasingly being celebrated as a hero on May 9, not as the leader who was caught off guard in the 1941 German attack.\n\n\"Of course, the new generations do not really understand the significance of the holiday,\" Kolesnikov said. \"Those who do understand and know history are horrified by the way Putin has privatized it.\"\n\nAnd on Monday, the significance of May 9 may change yet again, depending on what Putin has to say.", "authors": ["Analysis Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}]}

Announcing his resignation from the BBC on Twitter in November, the veteran presenter wrote that he was “keen to get my own voice back”. Moving to broadcast giant Global, which operates LBC, would allow him to deliver “fast-paced, very regular political journalism… with no filter”.\n\nHe will be joining fellow BBC departee John Humphrys at Global, where the former Today programme presenter now hosts a show on Classic FM. Following Marr’s resignation, Humphrys agreed that remaining impartial at the BBC was “a constraint”. “When I freed myself after 51 years, the limit on what I could say, which is rightly there, lifted,” said Humphry, who quit Radio 4’s Today in 2019.\n\nMarr will also “find the constricting stays of the impartiality girdle considerably loosened in his new role”, predicted Robin Aitken at The Telegraph. “And he will also be able to write opinionated articles for newspapers and magazines, forbidden territory for BBC journalists.”\n\nMarr’s departure is one of the latest moves in “a game of musical chairs among leading presenters and journalists at the BBC, with executives trying to find roles for them”, said The Guardian.\n\nAnother significant change was confirmed today by Laura Kuenssberg, who will step down as political editor in April next year. In a statement, she said it had been “incredible to occupy the chair during a time of such change” in British politics, one that has seen two general elections, Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nKuenssberg, the first woman to hold the role, said she would “miss the daily drama” but after “what feels like decades’ worth of headlines, it’s time for the next move”. The journalist has reportedly been in talks to move to the Today programme, though this has not been confirmed.\n\n\n\nSources had previously said Kuenssberg’s move was “part of a major reshuffle of senior on-air staff”, The Guardian’s media editor Jim Waterson reported in October.\n\n\n\nAnother shake-up has also taken place in the US.

A statement on the channel said the group fights for “justice, equality and freedom for everyone”, adding: “Our time is now, protect your children and family.”\n\nBeach boxing session\n\nThe Times reported that Alpha Men Assemble has hosted several meetings in recent weeks for “training and strategy tactics”. At one session, on a beach at Littlehampton in West Sussex on 28 December, “up to 100 activists took part in boxing drills and a scrummaging exercise, in which two groups of dozens of people tried to push each other back”, said the paper.\n\nPosts on Telegram said that similar meetings were scheduled to take place this month in Brownhills in Staffordshire, and Motherwell in North Lanarkshire, Scotland.

USA TODAY's music team looks at the September and October heavyweights likely to scale the charts and boost the bottom line.\n\nSEPT. 10\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nFeels Like Home\n\nHaving explored classic soul music on 2010's 100 Miles From Memphis, Crow sets her sights on the other side of Tennessee with Feels Like Home, her first all-country album. The veteran singer/songwriter signed with Warner Music Nashville, and she lives there, so the vibes are in place. First single Easy was released in March. There's precedent here: In 2010, she joined Miranda Lambert and Loretta Lynn on a remake of Coal Miner's Daughter for a Lynn tribute album. — Jerry Shriver\n\nGloria Estefan\n\nThe Standards\n\nAs Estefan tells USA TODAY, \"I always knew I would do something like this\": a collection of songbook classics, delivered in English (mostly), Spanish and Portuguese, with some new lyrics crafted by the Cuban-American crooner herself. Guests include violinist Joshua Bell, sax man Dave Koz and Italian singer/songwriter Laura Pausini. Tracks range from Good Morning Heartache to the classic tango El Dia Que Me Quieras, Estefan's wedding song, delivered here en ingles. — Elysa Gardner\n\nKaskade\n\nAtmosphere\n\nAfter packing arenas and crafting hot remixes for Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, Ryan Raddon, better known as DJ/producer Kaskade, is no stranger to EDM fans. He sings on record for the first time on the hit title track, which spawned remixes by AMTRAC, Chocolate Puma and GTA. With its fat beats and swirling melody, it's been generating excitement for Kaskade's eighth studio album, the follow-up to 2011's Grammy-nominated Fire & Ice. — Edna Gundersen\n\nJanelle Monáe\n\nThe Electric Lady\n\nPreceded by a trio of singles — the audacious Q.U.E.E.N. with Erykah Badu, frenetic Dance Apocalyptic and silky Primetime with Miguel — Monáe's sophomore disc is already living up to the high standards of hugely acclaimed 2010 debut The ArchAndroid. The idiosyncratic singer/songwriter/producer also enlists Solange on Electric Lady, Esperanza Spalding on Dorothy Dandridge Eyes and kindred spirit Prince on Givin' Em What They Love. Her imaginative, energetic futuristic funk-pop is likely to rise above the formulaic competition. — Gundersen\n\n2 Chainz\n\nB.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time\n\nThe Atlanta rapper gets more Me Time with the follow-up to his debut, Based on aT.R.U. Story. 2 Chainz, who rose up the rap ranks with his collaboration with Kanye West on Mercy and his No Lie single featuring Drake, has released two singles off this album, Netflix (featuring Fergie) and Feds Watching (featuring Pharrell). Based on their lyrics, 2 Chainz will be covering familiar topics: girls, guns, parties and police. Known for his swagger and over-the-top gestures, 2 Chainz promises that B.O.A.T.S. is more yacht than canoe. — Korina Lopez\n\nKeith Urban\n\nFuse\n\nNever a country traditionalist, Urban looked beyond his usual creative team to help him take disparate musical elements and fuse together a new \"progressive country\" sound for his first album since his 2011 vocal-cord surgery. That means working with producers Butch Walker, Nathan Chapman, Jay Joyce and Stargate, among others. Single Little Bit of Everything already has topped the country chart; you can bet Raise 'Em Up, a duet with Eric Church, eventually will, too. There's also a track with Miranda Lambert. — Brian Mansfield\n\nSEPT. 17\n\nAvicii\n\nTrue\n\nThe Stockholm-born Tim Bergling, whose 2011 smash Levels topped dance charts around the world, already stoked anticipation for his full-length album with global phenom Wake Me Up, featuring R&B singer Aloe Blacc and Mike Einziger of Incubus. Broadening his scope, the DJ, mixer and producer pumps emotion into dance-floor thumpers with guests from bluegrass queen Alison Krauss and rock band Blondfire to Swedish pop star Linnea Henriksson and indie folk-rocker Audra Mae. Also on board are Nile Rodgers, who produced Daft Punk's smash Get Lucky, and country's Mac Davis, writer of the Elvis Presley hit A Little Less Conversation. — Gundersen\n\nElvis Costello & The Roots\n\nWise Up Ghost\n\nIn his quest to keep pushing himself in new directions, Costello is teaming with The Roots' Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson and Roots associate Steve Mandel to produce an album he describes in a release as \"the shortest distance between here and there\" and containing \"both rhythm and what is read.\" ?uestlove says his hip-hop group's 14-track collaboration \"is a moody, brooding affai,'' with \"cathartic rhythms and dissonant lullabies.'' And it's out on Blue Note, a jazz label. Go figure. Look for a guest vocal from La Marisoul, lead singer of the Los Angeles group La Santa Cecilia, on Cinco Minutos Con Vos. A video for first single Walk Us Uptown was released in July. — Shriver\n\nJack Johnson\n\nFrom Here to Now to You\n\nHawaii's surf-rocker returns to the folk-pop sound that made him a star on his sixth studio album. For these 12 songs, he reunites not only with producer Mario Caldato Jr., who helmed 2005's In Between Dreams, but slide guitarist Ben Harper as well. Johnson wrote the album entirely on acoustic guitar, but the arrangements get fleshed out with Harper's Weissenborn guitar, ukulele, glockenspiel, melodica and the like. — Mansfield\n\nMGMT\n\nMGMT\n\nFor the electro-pop duo's third album, Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser retreated to a bare-bones studio in a secluded area of western New York and just let the creativity flow in jam sessions that went on for hours. The result: 10 tracks to keep their seasoned fans satisfied and recruit new ones. Out now is single Alien Days, a dreamy synth-pop ballad. — Lopez\n\nChris Young\n\nA.M.\n\nYoung came closer than he'd probably care to admit to having a posthumous release after being hospitalized for a bacterial infection in his left leg last month. That would have been a real shame, because he has become one of country's most reliable hitmakers below the superstar level. A.M., produced by James Stroud, takes a slightly more aggressive approach than past albums, as evidenced by single Aw Naw. Young co-wrote six of the album's 11 tracks — Mansfield\n\nSEPT. 24\n\nCher\n\nCloser to the Truth\n\nThe indestructible, indefatigable diva has been churning out hits since 1965, and she's not finished. Her first studio album since 2001's Living Proof boasts Pink-penned ballad Lie to Me, disco burner Take It Like a Man (a duet with Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters) and a heartfelt 9/11 anthem, Sirens. Timbaland produced I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream, written by Bonnie McKee, and Paul Oakenfold had a hand in writing No. 1 dance hit Woman's World, which Cher performed on the season finale of The Voice. Cher, 67, also dishes up a tune called Dressed to Kill. Watch out, pop amateurs. — Gundersen\n\nDrake\n\nNothing Was the Same\n\n\"This album is all about growth,\" Drake told Rolling Stone of his follow-up to 2011's Grammy Award-winner Take Care. Same's first single, the sweetly sexy Hold On We're Going Home, was co-produced by the Toronto-bred hip-hop star's longtime cohort Noah \"40\" Shebib and features Majid Jordan. Other guests include Jay Z and Lil Wayne, and among the song titles are Tuscan Leather (the intro track) and Connect. — Gardner\n\nIcona Pop\n\nThis Is ... Icona Pop\n\nSince single I Love It was featured on HBO's Girls, Swedish BFFs Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt have become the new faces of rave. With the recent release of second single All Night, the EDM duo hope to keep the party going. — Lopez\n\nElton John\n\nThe Diving Board\n\nWritten in five days and recorded in another five, The Diving Board returns to the simpler recording process of John's early career. On his first solo album in seven years, the focus is on his voice and piano, the core of John's finest work since his magical run of shows at L.A.'s storied Troubadour club. Longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin provides lyrics, and T Bone Burnett, who worked with John and Leon Russell on 2010's The Union, produces the set of 12 new songs and three piano interludes. — Gundersen\n\nJason Derulo\n\nTattoos\n\nSince Derulo suffered a severe neck injury in January 2012, the R&B singer has been busy getting his health back on track and crafting his third album. Lead single The Other Side peaked at No. 7 on USA TODAY's top 40 airplay chart. \"I wanted to make a record that I wanted to listen to all the time,\" he says. \"Not just this year, not just next year, but for a long time.\" — Lopez\n\nAlan Jackson\n\nThe Bluegrass Album\n\nIt took only about 15 years, but Jackson finally got around to making the bluegrass record he's always wanted to make. He got a top-flight band to help him cut it, too: Rob Ickes on Dobro, Sammy Shelor on banjo, Adam Steffey on mandolin, Tim Crouch on fiddle, Tim Dishman on bass, Scott Coney on guitar and Ronnie Bowman and Don Rigsby singing harmony. The album includes remakes of John Anderson's Wild and Blue and Jackson's own Let's Get Back to Me and You, but it's the originals that make the set, especially Blacktop, Jackson's answer to the current crop of \"dirt road\" country records. — Mansfield\n\nKings of Leon\n\nMechanical Bull\n\nSince the Followills released their last album, Come Around Sundown, in 2010, the guys got married, and Nathan, Caleb and Matthew became dads. On their new album, they take a lighter approach, stepping away from the solemn, yearning rock of earlier records. First singles Supersoaker and Wait for Me are evidence. — Lopez\n\nSting\n\nThe Last Ship\n\nSting's first album of new material in a decade is also a prelude to his first musical, which bears the same title and is expected on Broadway next year. Inspired by his youth in a Northern England shipbuilding community (which also informed his 1991 album, The Soul Cages), Last Ship features reflective, folk-based tunes delivered by the working-class-lad-turned-rock-star with other musicians from Britain's North East. — Gardner\n\nSEPT. 30\n\nLorde\n\nPure Heroine\n\nLorde (Ella Yelich-O'Connor) is the year's pop comet, propelled largely by the viral Royals, a Spotify record-breaker and global hit that sent the singer to No. 1 on Billboard's alternative radio chart — it's the first time a female artist has topped it in 17 years. Royals and Tennis Court have built excitement for her debut, and critics raved when Lorde, 16, recently performed new tracks White Teeth Teens, 400 Lux, A World Alone, Buzzcut Season and Ribs in her native New Zealand. — Gundersen\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nThe 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2\n\nBecause no one can get enough of him, the legend of summer returns this fall with the second half of this year's best-selling album. Part 2 will feature 11 new tunes — including the already unveiled Take Back the Night, co-produced by Timberlake, Timbaland and Jerome \"J-Roc\" Harmon — plus a \"special surprise,\" according to a release. Tracks are set to include Murder, which may reunite him with fellow legend Jay Z, and Cabaret, featuring Drake. — Gardner\n\nOCT. 8\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nBangerz\n\nThe artist formerly known as Hannah Montana embraces her raunchy, edgy image, which she described to MTV as \"white trash and Chanel.\" For Bangerz, she recruited the talents of producers and songwriters such as Pharrell Williams and will.i.am. While her summer anthem We Can't Stop boasts about her party stamina, her second single, love ballad Wrecking Ball, shows her softer side, despite the title. — Lopez\n\nOCT. 15\n\nThe Avett Brothers\n\nMagpie and the Dandelion\n\nThe North Carolina-based folk-rockers will roll out their eighth studio album, the follow-up to last year's The Carpenter, which was produced by Rick Rubin and earned them their first Grammy nomination (for best Americana album). Magpie contains more songs from those Rubin-led Carpenter sessions and is expected to explore themes of youthful wonder (hence the title) and societal woes. First single Another Is Waiting was released in August. — Shriver\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nTo All the Girls …\n\nWhen you're hot, you're hot — and it doesn't matter if you're 80. To further celebrate his significant birthday year, Nelson will release his third album in 16 months, this one containing 18 newly recorded duets with the crème de la femme of country music. Most of the country/gospel/pop titles are lesser-known, but his partners are anything but: Dolly Parton, Mavis Staples, Sheryl Crow, Loretta Lynn, Wynonna Judd, Rosanne Cash, Alison Krauss, Miranda Lambert, Tina Rose, Carrie Underwood, Emmylou Harris, Norah Jones, Secret Sisters, Brandi Carlile, Lily Meola, Shelby Lynne, Melonie Cannon and Paula Nelson. Potential collectors, take note: Willie now has more than 200 albums to his name. — Shriver\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nNew\n\n\"We can do what we want, we can live as we choose,\" McCartney sings on the title track of his 16th studio album. The tune, produced by Mark Ronson, is typical McCartney: melodic, bouncy, sunny. The 12-track New is his first set of fresh solo material since 2007's Memory Almost Full. In the interim, he released a live album, a ballet score, 2008's Electric Arguments as The Fireman and 2012's standards collection Kisses on the Bottom. And he's been on the road for the past year on his Out There! tour. For the 71-year-old former Beatle, living as he chooses does not include retirement. — Gundersen\n\nPearl Jam\n\nLightning Bolt\n\nMore than 22 years ago, Pearl Jam exploded with the definitive alt-rock thunderbolt, Ten. The durable Seattle band is set to celebrate that number again. Lightning Bolt, the group's 10th studio album, was produced by Brendan O'Brien, whose affiliation with Pearl Jam began as the producer and mixer for 1993's Vs. The July release of track Mind Your Manners, a tough, guitar-fueled blast of punk, set the stage for Bolt, the follow-up to 2009's Backspacer. The band also whet appetites with live performances of the title track and Future Days. — Gundersen\n\nOCT. 22\n\nKaty Perry\n\nPrism\n\nThe pop superstar's fourth studio album, the follow-up to 2010 hit machine Teenage Dream, got off to a roaring start with Roar, an irresistible pop anthem that racked up the year's tallest digital song sales week after selling 557,000 copies. Next up is Dark Horse, a single chosen by a fan vote for release Sept. 17. Produced by Dr. Luke and Circut and featuring Juicy J, the song was written by Perry and friend Sarah Hudson. Perry also wrote the high-energy Walking on Air, inspired by '90s deep house music. Early snippets hint at a shift from candied pop toward a wider stylistic menu. — Gundersen\n\nOCT. 29\n\nArcade Fire\n\nAs yet untitled\n\nSomebody light a match under these guys. The Canadian indie-rock group is playing extremely coy with releasing details about its fourth studio album, confirming only the release date and the fact that the members have been in the studio with producer James Murphy, the former frontman for LCD Soundsystem. Fans speculate that the new work — the band's first since 2010's The Suburbs (Grammy's album of the year) — could be called Reflektor after the group confirmed recently that it was behind a graffiti art campaign that incorporated that word. Can you say Arcade games? — Shriver\n\nToby Keith\n\nDrinks After Work\n\nKeith, one of country's most consistent acts, marks 20 years in the business with his latest album, which he produced himself. He had a hand in writing nine of the 10 tracks, working with longtime songwriting collaborators Scotty Emerick, Bobby Pinson and Rivers Rutherford. The deluxe edition has three additional cuts, including a remake of Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville with Sammy Hagar and a tribute to bandleader Chuck Goff, who died in a car wreck in February. — Mansfield\n\nLATE 2013\n\nAnother wave of big albums hits later this fall, kicking off with Eminem's eagerly awaited The Marshall Mathers LP 2 on Nov. 5, followed by Lady Gaga's Artpop on Nov. 11. Also on the way are Chris Brown's X, Rick Ross' Mastermind, R. Kelly's Black Panties and M.I.A.'s Matangi, plus albums by Britney Spears, One Direction, Jennifer Lopez, Wu-Tang Clan and T-Pain. In the possibility column: Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Shakira, the Jonas Brothers and the Black Keys. Look for details in an upcoming holiday album forecast.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columnists/chuck-campbell/2019/04/19/new-music-beyonce-homecoming-live-album-bts-map-of-the-soul-persona-lizzo-cuz-i-love-you-reviews/3519679002/", "title": "Miley Cyrus could be playing, or crying for help, with 'She Is Coming'", "text": "Miley Cyrus unapologetically celebrates sex, drugs and whatever might pass for rock ‘n’ roll these days with her new EP “She Is Coming,” a provocative, playful and sometimes disturbing collection of six songs.\n\nShe’s a promiscuous, drug-addled party animal here, and Cyrus certainly sounds authentic in this role of an antihero hedonist. But it’s hard to say if she’s simply dispensing an assortment of YOLO anthems or issuing a cry for help, and the answer to that won’t come until later.\n\n“She Is Coming” is the first of three EPs from Cyrus, and the trilogy will ultimately combine to form the collection “She Is: Miley Cyrus.” So the new release could be the premise of a three-part story that might also include a second act (conflict?) and a finale (resolution?).\n\nBut however it all shakes out, “She Is Coming” is a trip-hop-pop-dance hallucination, laced with expletives, festive themes and an air that is both liberating and uneasy.\n\nCyrus teams up with RuPaul for the raunchy, campy “Cattitude” propelled by a reverberating beat. propelling her as she boasts, “Since I was 3, I’ve been banging the drum.” She also declares herself “a little bit unholy” on “Unholy” and calls herself nasty, a freak and a witch on the trippy “Mother’s Daughter.” shrugging it off with, “Must be something in the water or that I’m my mother’s daughter.”\n\nOn “D.R.E.A.M.” – which stands for “drugs rule everything around me” – Cyrus seems indifferent or giddy about waking up with strangers and finding new tattoos on her body, and she loses herself in an ethereal sea of echoing voices and innuendo on “Party Up the Street” featuring Swae Lee.\n\nThe EP’s droll excess finally comes to a focus with the affecting ballad/closer “The Most” as the 26-year-old, emoting with the world weariness of someone twice her age, humbly conveys that she’s undeserving of love.\n\nIs that a personal epiphany or a plea for intervention? We’ll find out later …\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\n\"She Is Coming\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nEgerton nails Elton on 'Rocketman'\n\nThere’s every reason to believe the new Elton John biopic “Rocketman” will extend Hollywood’s music-drama blockbuster streak fueled by last fall’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “A Star Is Born.”\n\nPlus this one is happier than the others: Elton John is still living among us, and he even performs a new song on the soundtrack, “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again,” with Taron Egerton, who plays him in the film.For his part, Egerton holds his own with John on the duet and shines on the rest of the soundtrack as a believable alternative version of John rather than a pale imitation.\n\n“Rocketman (Music From the Motion Picture)” is a 22-track musical celebration of John featuring reimagined versions of most of his iconic songs as well as some of his less memorable ones.\n\nAnd fortunately, there’s no “Island Girl” to be found.\n\nThe soundtrack is campy (how could it not be?) and “Grease”-level cheesy at times, like with the wince-inducing renditions of “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)” and “Rock and Roll Madonna.” It also parallels “Mamma Mia!” in that some anticipated songs are prematurely truncated, including “Crocodile Rock,” “Pinball Wizard” and “Bennie and the Jets.”\n\nBut the frustrations and ho-hum moments seem inconsequential when Egerton and company elevate their game for spectacular (and sometimes entirely reinvented) versions of Elton John’s premium material.\n\nEgerton is impressive in the complicated structure of “Your Song” and commanding as “Rocket Man” escalates from a spacey sprawl into a boisterous sing-along. Meanwhile, the orchestrated “Tiny Dancer” and string-based “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word” are emotionally on point. And just when the soundtrack verges on getting too dark with the histrionic “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” up pops Egerton with a playful “I’m Still Standing.”\n\nIt’ll leave you feeling like a little kid.\n\nvarious acts\n\n'Rocketman' soundtrack\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRammstein hammers home theatrics\n\nIt might be an unexpected reaction to a Rammstein album, but the German band’s new self-titled release is oddly comforting.\n\nIrrespective of all the electric fury, disturbing themes and pervasive menace, “Rammstein” is sneakily melodic, the hooks and riffs are inescapably infectious, and the theatrics are rarely more threatening than that of a Disney villain.\n\nThese guys have been hanging together with the same lineup for a quarter of a century, and despite the decade-long gap since the last release, “Rammstein” is a seamless addition to the act’s discography – confident, otherworldly and distinct.\n\nIt’s also a good chance to practice your high-school German.\n\nOpening track/bombastic beauty “Deutschland,” where vocalist Till Lindemann wearily growls his ambivalent feelings for his homeland, re-introduces us to the gang and their trademark histrionics, blending metal and electronica to give a sidelong-glancing, dim view of humanity.\n\nThe Berlin-based band subsequently chugs through the mainstreamish “Radio,” propels across the operatic spectacle of “Zeig Dich” and rises from the sleazy miasma of “Auslander” for Lindemann’s spoken-theater wink at sleazy come-ons.\n\nLindemann serves more lessons from his pulpit, dovetailing into the dirty rock tease of “Sex” for a lewd proposal, and going even darker in the sister-as-sex-worker theme buried in suppressed whispers of “Puppe” and gliding along the horror-film score and child-abductor premise of closing cut “Hallomann.”\n\nYet even when he’s trying to lure someone into his car, presumably with the worst intentions, there’s something perversely inviting about it all.\n\nRammstein\n\n\"Rammstein\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nTodrick Hall ushers in Pride season\n\nTodrick Hall dropped his new “Haus Party, Pt. 1” just in time for Pride season across America, and he overflows with fitting confidence on the 7-track release.\n\nHall, who has become a music, Broadway, YouTube and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” star since competing on “American Idol” a decade ago, is entrenched in LGBTQ tropes on the playful “Haus Party, Pt. 1” – drag culture, nightclub life and sex-charged innuendo.\n\nIt’s celebratory and fun, even if most of these tracks are disposable novelty songs.\n\nHall commands focus immediately with “Attention,” a frenetic pep rally of a dance track that turns both salty and suggestive, as when he calls out, “Tell your new boyfriend to stay out of my DM.”\n\nThe subsequent snaky “I Like Boys” is a self-assured coming out proclamation – complete with lines like, “Tell them girls, ‘thank you, next’.” And drag is celebrated on the strutting showoff song “Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels” and more effectively on “Chapstick,” featuring “RPDR” all-star Trixie Mattel and a winking assertion that the full-blown drag look is “just a little Chapstick.”\n\nHall isn’t merely playing for laughs on “Haus Party,” either. He shows a sweeter, romantic side (well, with obvious sexual overtones) on “Glitter,” employing a fine R&B vocal for lines like, “I wanna dance with you for life.”\n\nAnd in a late pivot, he offers the nightclub-as-church themed “Amen” and the sweeping EDM of closer “Relove,” the latter of which would suit mainstream radio, down to his modulated vocals.\n\nYet a problem with “Amen” and “Relove” is that they’re too conventional, forgettable background music that feels lackluster compared to the first part of “Haus Party, Pt. 1.”\n\nMaybe Hall will rediscover his momentum for “Pt. 2.”\n\nTodrick Hall\n\n\"Haus Party, Pt. 1\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nJepsen soft sells 'Dedicated'\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen’s new “Dedicated” is like an asteroid sailing in and out of other pop-star orbits.\n\nThe track “Now That I Found You” sounds like an electro-dance song from Robyn; the jumbly party cut “Want You In My Room” could come from Taylor Swift’s playbook; and the quirky robo-love ballad “Everything He Needs” is ersatz Kylie Minogue. Jepsen even time-travels to a Prince-inspired Sheena Easton bygone era with the crunchy-flutter tease of “No Drug Like Me.”\n\nThe Canadian singer’s audience will surely hear other artists echoing throughout “Dedicated,” which is both a testament to her adaptability and an indication that her persona is not distinct. Her voice is serviceable, if anonymous, her focus is relentlessly on infatuations (which is exhausting for a 15-track album built on several sluggishly paced cuts), and her writing structure is shamelessly formulaic.\n\nAt the same time, her lyrical idiosyncrasies and offbeat twists in the arrangements deliver redeeming charm to “Dedicated,” be it in the Theremin-ly effects of the winking “Everything He Needs” or the cathartic build of “Too Much.” Also, her exasperations are relatable – “I don’t have the energy to risk a broken heart,” she sings on “Happy Not Knowing,” and ambivalence comes to a head on “Right Words Wrong Time” as she cautions, “Don’t you tell me now that you’re ready for me.”\n\nShe also compensates for several uneventful and/or shallow tracks with a disarmingly sincere “Real Love,” her voice betraying genuine wariness and vulnerability as she sings, “I just don’t know who to trust sometimes.”\n\nUltimately, the release is modestly alluring enough to have you rooting for Jepsen, even if you aren’t dedicated to “Dedicated.” And if you aren’t, she has a message on album-closer “Party for One”: “If you don’t care about me, I’ll just dance with myself.”\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen\n\n\"Dedicated\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLucette, Sturgill Simpson intoxicate\n\nWhen Canadian singer-songwriter Lauren Gillis, aka Lucette, launched her debut “Black Is the Color” five years ago, her career path looked clear. The release was produced by Dave Cobb, who produced country-music breakouts Sturgill Simpson and Jason Isbell, and featured folk noir songs. Simpson even played the title character in the video for the single “Bobby Reid.”\n\nBut the Edmonton singer’s sophomore release, produced by Simpson, is a pivot for both of them.\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” is a piano-and-electronica-steeped collection of quietly opulent, moody songs that sound like a cross-pollination of Lana Del Rey, Cowboy Junkies and Mazzy Star.\n\nIt’s both intoxicating and bare, and maybe not something you’d expect from neo-outlaw-country star Simpson. But consider: His singing persona and Lucette’s persona could be the quintessential star-crossed lovers, their lives intertwining in opposites-attract passion until the infatuation fades and the inevitable doom sets in.\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” could chronicle such a relationship, Lucette flush with irrational love (a la classic girl-group delusion) in the exuberant swells of “Angel.” Before then, she pines about being a kept woman on the title track, dreams of companionship in the sax-spiked brooding waltz “Out of the Rain” and teases at the dangerous excitement that can be found in unexpected places on the synth-soaked “Full Moon Town.”\n\nPost-“Angel,” the throaty Lucette sees the inevitable cracks in her soul, meditating on escape in the gospel-flavored “Fly to Heaven,” hinting at running away in the stark, vocal-centric “California” and reaching an epiphany with “Crazy Bird”: “You’re in the sky, I’m on the ground.”\n\nThere are sobering traces of mental instability on the reverberating “Talk to Myself” before the release concludes with the desperate plea “Lover Don’t Give Up on Me,” where she sings, “When it’s gone, there’s nothing left but searching for the light.”\n\n“Deluxe Hotel Room” rates an extended stay.\n\nLucette\n\n\"Deluxe Hotel Room\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBudokan Boys play with 'Dad'\n\nMusic has long been used for eccentric purposes, and electronica has been a particularly fertile ground for whimsical musicians, from Kraftwerk and Yello to Daft Punk and Kanye West.\n\nThe Budokan Boys – instrumentalist/programmer Jeff T. Byrd and vocalist/lyricist Michael Jeffrey Lee – further establish themselves as part of this would-be sub-genre of electro-performance-artists with “Dad Is Bad,” a follow-up to the duo’s “That’s How You Become a Clown.”\n\n“Dad Is Bad’s” eight tracks are mostly stories with bizarre twists and unhappy endings for some of its characters, skittering across an onslaught of playful technology and presented by Lee in a variety of modulated vocals.\n\nListeners will feel mixed emotions when Lee’s cartoonish voice somersaults over the off-kilter beat and menacing drone of “Sick Pick” to reach the sobering conclusion, “Always post a picture so you don’t die alone/You don’t want to die alone.” Later, Lee lets his Southern accent fly on “My Old Friend,” which sounds like a lighthearted exploration of sexual identity until his “old friend” ends up dead by suicide.: “I thought maybe he was gay, maybe he wasn’t, but now he’s dead, end of discussion.”\n\nThe Budokan Boys also kick up a whirlwind of wobbly percussion to talk about random God sightings on “God Today,” stretch out a taut style of stripped-down exotica for “The Hermit” and unfurl the weirdly wry tale of a model prisoner who gave up his life “to save the warden’s son” on “The Prisoner.”\n\nThe songs of “Dad Is Bad,” which are all distinct from each other, don’t lend themselves to singing along and, while stirring, they don’t lend themselves to dancing along, either. Yet their unique charm will encourage repeated listens.\n\nSo when Lee employs a hybrid human/robot voice on the churning “Rent Me” to offer his wide-ranging services – “You should rent me, I’m cheap!” – you’ll already know you want to keep him around.\n\nBudokan Boys\n\n\"Dad Is Bad\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWords sometimes fail Antony Carle\n\nThe artistry behind Antony Carle’s new “The Moment” is fascinating: His elegantly ethereal voice weaves through a blend of classic chamber and pop music as well as thoroughly modern electronic soundscapes, the combination of which creates a mystical realm.\n\nHowever, the illusion is shaded by his slurry enunciation as he self-indulgently drops words into an aural blur – though to be fair, the lyrics that are clear are sometimes mundane, so perhaps he’s shielding his lines with deliberate obfuscation.\n\nRegardless, Carle’s moany/breathless delivery on “But You, Everybody Is” glides passionately above the soulful/New Age bliss, and the arrangement of “Icon” is as delicate and precise as a music box as Carle sings, “I got you on my mind – always … Big dreams on my mind – always.” Meanwhile, in the sophisticated EDM of “Save Face” he frets, “What will we do for money when it’s all gone?” and eventually hangs up in frantic repetitions of “When it’s all gone?!? When it’s all gone?!?”\n\nOne of the beauties of “The Moment” is that Carle takes risks, even if they don’t always pay off. For example, “Commitment” is a complicated cut anchored to an irregular beat as the singer rushes through lines with a talk/sing/rap flurry – “What is it going to take for you to grow up? … What do you take me for, do I look dumb to you?” – and the song becomes mired in nervous energy. Carle also takes the elevator up to the pulsing “Top Floor” and ultimately gets lost in an inconclusive end.\n\nYet even if Carle strays, his distinguishing characteristics consistently surface with compelling impact, such as when he contemplates transformation in the throbbing “Manifesto”: “For it to happen, I have to forget what I know.”\n\nAnd with only a slight mutation, his next release could be even more memorable than this.\n\nAntony Carle\n\n\"The Moment\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMehldau takes improbable path\n\nJazz pianist Brad Mehldau goes on a wild bender with his new “Finding Gabriel,” an unexpected mix of quaint synthesizers, classical music, New Age, performance art and Muzak.\n\nThose individual components of sound may seem entirely incompatible with each other, but the familiar pieces merge together into something improbably transformative.\n\nIn addition to working with his more traditional keyboards, Mehldau uses an analog synthesizer to create riffs and passages worthy of a 1970s B movie. To that he adds strings and horns suitable for an elegant wedding and wordless, angelic vocals that could work for a stately funeral or perhaps an elevator ride. And songs drift through passages that could serve as background for meditation one minute and a sophisticated party the next.\n\nMehldau also adds biblical-inspired themes, because why not?\n\nBreakbeat, drones, trumpet and layered vocals kick off “Finding Gabriel” with the protracted opening track, “The Garden,” before the release moves on to the oddly crunchy interlude “Born to Trouble,” the gurgling buzz of the cinematic “Striving After Wind” and the thickened brew of “O Ephraim” (which sounds like the descendant of an Ennio Morricone composition).\n\n“Finding Gabriel” also makes a strong finish with the liquid electronica of “Make It All Go Away,” the lush strings and irregular beat of “Deep Water” and the comparatively bustling chaos of “Proverb of Ashes.”\n\nSometimes Mehldau’s more theatrical turns on “Finding Gabriel” are both challenging and rewarding: “St Mark Is Howling in the City of Night” and the title track could be performance art for a cocktail lounge, for instance. But when Mehldau throws all subtleties out the window on the Trump-bashing “The Prophet Is a Fool,” he gets heavy-handed and cheesy to the point the album’s mystique is diluted.\n\nFortunately, he moves on and restores the illusion.\n\nBrad Mehldau\n\n\"Finding Gabriel\"\n\nRating: 4 (out 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCiara embraces 'Beauty Marks'\n\nCiara is a woman who got it together singing about getting it together on her new “Beauty Marks.”\n\nThe 33-year-old vocalist/model had a murky path to this clear-headed release. The Atlanta-based singer was still a teen in the mid-2000s when she rocketed to the front of the crunk/R&B movement with a quick string of hits such as “Goodies” and “1, 2 Step.” Then the hits faded, the sales slacked, and Ciara’s career took a backseat to her personal life – a public romance and breakup with Future followed by a public romance and marriage to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. And she had two children along the way.\n\n\"Beauty Marks,” her first release since 2015’s “Jackie,” finds Ciara comfortable in her skin, a middle-of-the-road performer who doesn’t stand out beyond her distinctly Janet-Jackson-like voice. The arrangements are modern but not pioneering, and fitfully clunky (“Set,” “Greatest Love”). Her lyrics are true yet familiar.\n\nCiara taps into the wobbly electronic throb of opener “I Love Myself,” singing “I’ve been to the bottom and I’ve seen the end” and expressing the epiphany that led to self-care (“I found the problem, and it starts with me”). Later, Kelly Rowland swings by for the playfully sleek woman-power anthem “Girl Gang,” and Ciara flexes her might in the brassy reverberations of the rewarding “Dose.”\n\nSexy songs balance the self-help mojo of “Beauty Marks” – Ciara battling urges in the catchy percolation of “Trust Myself,” flirting with Tekno in the playful throwaway “Freak Me” and embodying a 1980s-era Prince ingenue in the retro-fresh cool of “Thinkin Bout You,” where she tries to balance infatuation with caution.\n\nAnd naturally the release ends with the inevitable piano-and-strings title-track ballad, formulaic but well-executed. as she sighs, “Oh what a feeling to wake up every day, knowing I am loved by you.”\n\nPredictable, maybe, but it’s also reassuring.\n\nCiara\n\n\"Beauty Marks\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nA.A. Bondy's captivates with obscurity\n\nA.A. Bondy’s new “Enderness” is a subtly spellbinding listen that might catch listeners unawares.\n\nThe Alabama-native former alt-rocker (with the band Verbena) returns with his first solo singer-songwriter album in 8 years, switching from an acoustic-oriented foundation to an electronic-based sound that is vaguely indistinct and beautifully grim.\n\nWaves of ambient New Age drones and near-drones wash over the skeleton of a blues framework, creating a net result that conveys sad calmness. And Bondy’s dim view of the world, delivered in bleak and often spaced out vocals, is the finishing touch for an opioid-addled America. … There’s even a stark song about drug addiction, “Fentanyl Freddy.”\n\nYet though “Enderness” feels like that uncomfortable experience of being trapped in a drowsy limbo, unable to fall asleep or fully wake up, the trippy tone ultimately beguiles, beckoning the listener to surrender.\n\nBondy sings in social-media acronyms and broken thoughts in the meditative sprawl of opener “Diamond Skull,” hypnotizes with the ominous refrain of “I’ll never know every shape you can take” on “I’ll Never Know,” disappears in the soothing strains and scorched imagery of “#Lost Hills” and whispers in the muted, heartbeat pulses of “The Tree With the Lights.”\n\nElsewhere, instrumental tracks underscore the aura, from the brightening shimmer of “Pan Tran” to the lulling title-track closer, where the ebb and flow of long synthetic notes is nuanced by effects that facsimilate rolling waves … or distant thunder … or a far away, disintegrating glacier.\n\n“Enderless” is compellingly ambiguous, a new style of shoegaze music where what you see is too blurry to recognize.\n\nA.A. Bondy\n\n\"Enderness\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMemphis band never gives up\n\nSouthern Avenue further establishes its foothold as a roots-music band of the future with “Keep On,” the Memphis band’s follow-up to its 2017 self-titled debut.\n\nThe group breathes new life into a venerable, thoroughly American, blend of blues, R&B and gospel with two distinctive signatures – the rock finesse of Israeli guitarist Ori Naftaly and the passionate delivery of American soul singer Tierinni Jackson.\n\nSouthern Avenue is full speed ahead from the start of “Keep On,” dispensing the title track with a jazzy brew of horns and stomping beat and Tierinni Jackson’s belted earworm refrain: “You get what you put out.” From there the band continues to emanate an infectious glow, from Naftaly’s teasing guitar that supplies tension for “Whiskey Love” to the singer’s beckoning offer on the smoky “Savior” to “put it all in my hands, oh baby let me save ya” to the funk-anchored groove of “Switchup.”\n\nSouthern Avenue ultimately hits a few potholes as the journey wears on, with Tierinii Jackson forced to sell the indistinct arrangement of “The Tea I Sip,” for example, and with a filler atmosphere taking over other tracks such as the directionless “Too Good for You” and the low-energy “We’ve Got the Music.”\n\nYet “Keep On” keeps on coming back, with the sweet romance of “Lucky,” the fired-up tempo of “Jive” and the rock-opera-esque climax of “She Gets Me High.”\n\nNo lull ever creates a protracted drag on “Keep On,” and the band’s effervescent spirit is a constant – all the way to the simmering optimism of the feelgood finale, “We’re Gonna Make It.”\n\nIndeed, it does seem like they’re going to make it.\n\nSouthern Avenue\n\n\"Keep On\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Liberal rednecks' still stoke the fire\n\nThree years ago, Trae Crowder, Drew Morgan and Corey Ryan Forrester were knocking around Knoxville’s amateur comedy scene when an expletive-laden comic video rant by Crowder went viral on Facebook and beyond. Calling himself a liberal redneck, Crowder employed his authentic rural Tennessee accent to emphatically advocate for LGBTQ rights.\n\nThis was during the 2016 election campaign, and Crowder’s voice – which sounds like every stereotype of a close-minded bigot, though his perspective is on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum – caught fire as more viral videos followed. Crowder and his like-minded, similarly-accented comedy pals Morgan and Forrester have been on tour crisscrossing America together ever since, stoking their elevated visibility with national TV appearances, a collaborative book, a heightened social media presence and more.\n\nThe new audio release, “wellRED Live From Lexington,” finds the trio more frustrated than ever after two years of the Trump presidency and doubling down on their push for social equality while also poking fun at their own “good ol’ boy” upbringings and the internal conflicts they’ve had reconciling their affection for the South and their hate of bigotry.\n\nThe 90-plus minute “Live From Lexington” is broken into thirds, plus a short epilogue where the three jointly talked about a couple of hilarious shared experiences. The force-of-nature Forrester kicks off “Live” with an electric set, pitting his love for Chick-fil-A food against his disdain for the company’s support of anti-LGBTQ policy and then brushing on everything from pudding cups and Ramen noodles to North Georgia culture and illogical redneck arguments against gays in the military. Morgan follows with a gentler start, building a set about his church-based upbringing, sports and county fairs into an explosive bit about being high at a church Nativity ceremony.\n\nCrowder, who now lives in California, starts with a nod to Knoxville, saying he was unfazed to learn that in today’s political climate that WWE wrestler Kane was elected mayor of Knox County. He also takes down the arrogance and naivete of would-be enlightened Californians before he settles into brilliant tales about his poor upbringing and his gutsy-but-flawed “pillbilly” mother, stories even conservative rednecks could enjoy.\n\nThen Crowder, a married father of two, refocuses on family at the end by skewering parents who reject their gay kids: “It blows my mind that something like that could actually impact the way they feel about their child.”\n\nThis may be prickly humor – raw, raunchy and confrontational – but there’s a lot of heart at its core.\n\nTrae Crowder, Drew Morgan, Corey Ryan Forrester\n\n\"wellRED Live From Lexington\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCranberries meet sad 'End'\n\nThere was no right way for The Cranberries to produce a final album with their late singer Dolores O’Riordan, but doing nothing at all would have been the worst move.\n\nO’Riordan, who died in January 2018 after drowning in a bathtub while intoxicated, had recorded vocal demos for new material before her death. Her band – brothers Noel (guitar) and Mike (bass) Hogan plus drummer Fergal Lawler – built up songs around her recordings to create the new “In the End.”\n\nThose vocals are decidedly unpolished and tentative at times, obviously because O’Riordan expected to finesse the process with additional recordings, and her bandmates decided to just make do with what they had rather than put her voice through unseemly processing in the studio.\n\nThe result is an “In the End” that sounds halting, albeit genuine, familiar and incredibly sad.\n\nThe group that created such 1990s hits as “Zombie,” “Linger,” Dreams” and “Ridiculous Thoughts” echoes their past – jangly alt-rock and catchy refrains, though nothing with “Zombie”-level voltage.\n\nO’Riordan, who died at age 46, maintains the childlike wonder in her voice here, shading the wistful and grim songs with hints of hope.\n\nAnd given her demise, the lyrics turn out to be a gut punch: “I know that time is moving fast” she muses in the darkness of “Lost,” while on the delicate “Illusion” she sings, “It’s all an illusion/This is my conclusion for now.” Also, “In the End’s” title track is a slow and ghostly finale where O’Riordan sings, “Ain’t it strange when everything you wanted was nothing that you wanted in the end?”\n\nFans would have wanted more than this collection of semi-memorable soft songs, just as they would have wanted more of O’Riordan, period. But as the singer herself would likely say, you take what you can get and make the most of it.\n\nThe Cranberries\n\n\"In the End\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPink is pale on \"Hurts 2B Human\"\n\nThis was supposed to be Pink’s moment. The April 26 release of her eighth studio album was planned to put her squarely in the spotlight. … Until Beyonce made the surprise release of “Homecoming: The Live Album,” Taylor Swift released the surprise single “ME!” and even Madonna came out of the woodwork to release the surprise single “Medellin.” What’s more, Lizzo came out of seemingly nowhere to top Amazon’s sales charts with the April 19 release of her bold new album, “Cuz I Love You.”\n\nNow Pink’s new “Hurts 2B Human” feels like an afterthought - and an overly familiar one at that, partly because four of the songs have already been released as singles, and partly because most of the other tracks sound like something Pink has done before.\n\nShe’s again working with an army of top-shelf collaborators (including Max Martin, Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Beck, Ryan Tedder and Sia) and top-shelf guest artists (including Khalid Chris Stapleton and Cash Cash).\n\nPlus she sings her guts out, tapping into her trademark themes such as perseverance, heartbreak and isolation. Songs like “Walk Me Home” and the title track are classic “you and me against the world” numbers that take on extra weight and poignancy as Pink prepares to turn 40 in September.\n\nAnd to contrast the morose air, she spins through the catchy kiss-off “Hustle” (which stylistically/thematically mirrors Elle King’s “Ex’s & Oh’s”) and settles into the heavily synthesized “90 Days” (which should prompt Imogen Heap to consult her lawyers for its similarity to her hit “Hide and Seek”).\n\nBut mostly Pink is down, sad about her “young emotions that just won’t grow up” on “My Attic” and self-pitying with the revelation “maybe I’m just scared to be happy” on “Happy.”\n\nIndividual tracks are beautiful, even touching, but overall “Hurts 2B Human” is déjà vu depression.\n\nPink\n\n\"Hurts 2B Human\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBeyonce's bloated without visuals\n\nBeyonce seized the rapt attention of the masses with this week's release of her new Netflix visual/aural feast “Homecoming Live,” which shows the conceptualization and execution of her performances at Coachella in 2018.\n\nThere’s also an audio-only companion piece, “Homecoming: The Live Album,” which is simply a mess.\n\nBeyonce is a force of nature on “Homecoming,” and she shares the spotlight with husband Jay-Z, daughter Blue Ivy, sister Solange, Destiny’s Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, dancers, fans, a drumline, other musicians. … And all that sharing fractures the “Homecoming” album experience, which stretches over 40 frustrating tracks that, at a running time of one hour and 49 minutes, sound both rushed and addled.\n\nWithout the visual context, the album’s focus is pulled by meandering medleys, excessive interludes and abruptly truncated songs (“Hold Up” only gets 46 seconds) – a sometimes unlistenable chaos of distractions and commotion.\n\nFortunately, Beyonce takes command of several showstoppers, revving up for her solo breakout “Crazy in Love” followed by the raw power of “Freedom,” delivering a one-two punch with the fierce delivery of “Don’t Hurt Yourself” and the clap-along “I Care,” drumming up late-album excitement with a boisterous “Get Me Bodied,” a lively “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” and an inspired rendition of “Love on Top.”\n\nFor his part, Jay-Z is a powerful match for his wife in the duet “Déjà Vu,” plus the three-song Destiny’s Child reunion – for “Lose My Breath,” “Say My Name” and “Soldier” - is a gratifying throwback.\n\nMore reviews:Anderson .Paak, Khalid, Billie Eilish and more\n\n“Homecoming Live” could have been edited into an incredible 12-track release, but as is, it’s a bloated collection that doesn’t stand on its own apart from the film.\n\nSo if you want to hear a great Beyonce album, listen to “Lemonade” instead.\n\nBeyonce\n\n\"Homecoming: The Live Album\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBTS sticks to the plan\n\nBTS is the most popular modern version on the quintessential boy band: wildly successful with the most fervent fan demographic – adolescents – and review-proof.\n\nYet the group of seven guys also breaks ground as the most successful K-pop band in American history, singing and rapping mostly in Korean. They’re currently unstoppable, at least until the inevitable splintering of the band members, and their new “Map of the Soul: Persona” was a guaranteed smash before it was even released.\n\nBut should it be?\n\nJimin, RM, V, Jin, Jungkook, Suga and J-Hope range in age from 21 to 26, and they’re a nonthreatening bunch of solid vocalists, because as always with boy bands, we don’t want any edgy men in the group to scare parents away.\n\nAnd when BTS slides into its very familiar groove, “Map of the Soul: Persona” offers a serviceable mix of soft dance, melodic pop and scruffy hip-hop … well-trodden territory for BTS, who isn’t trying to pioneer a new sound.\n\nHowever, the release is a scant 7 tracks, including unspectacular (cheesily produced) opening and closing rap/rock songs “Intro: Persona” and “Dionysys.”\n\nThe remaining five cuts are mostly satisfying, particularly the smoothly infections single “Boy With Luv” (featuring Halsey in a minor guest role) and the chilled hip-hop of “Home,” which slyly teases with “You know I want that … You know you got that.” Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran had a hand in co-writing the soft-focus, horn-accented romance of “Make It Right,” and “Mikrokosmos” floats in timeless-pop ether (and never quite comes in for a landing). The lethally slow melodrama “Jamais Vu” is the only clunker here, though rest-assured it will be embraced by fans all the same.\n\nGiven the moderate artistic quality of “Map of the Soul: Persona,” it’s hard to argue that BTS deserves all of their current success. But it’s even harder to argue that they don’t deserve at least some of it.\n\nBTS\n\n\"Map of the Soul: Persona\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLively Lizzo lets loose\n\nBrace yourself: Lizzo’s new “Cuz I Love You” is a sensory-overload assault of extremely friendly fire, an infectious and empowering release that checks subtlety at the door.\n\nThe Houston-native singer/rapper (and dancer) had previously held back on belting (she told Entertainment Weekly “I didn’t want to be that big black girl with a soulful voice”), but holding back isn’t in her nature, so now she belts with the best of them on “Cuz I Love You.”\n\nThe new release overflows with self-love and empowerment as Lizzo adds an exclamation point to nearly every line she delivers. Bumping against the heated dance groove of the jovial “Juice,” she proclaims, “Ain’t my fault that I’m out here makin’ news/I’m the pudding in the proof/Gotta blame it on my juice,” and she even contemplates marrying herself on the sizzling “Soulmate”: “I’m my own soulmate, I know how to love me … I’m never lonely!”\n\nAnd on the ultimate girl-power anthem, the blustery “Like a Girl,” Lizzo opens with “Woke up feeling like I just might run for president!” (Don’t even try to hold her back.)\n\nMeanwhile, Lizzo’s not a one-note phenomenon: She also channels her charisma into relationship songs, taking audible breaths between lines on the bold title track - and implying a huge “duh!” when she bellows “I’m cryin’ ‘cause I love you!” She also sends away an unsuitable suitor on “Jerome,” suggesting he, “come back when you’re grown.” And Lizzo dramatically erupts in the over-the-top, choir-backed “Heaven Help Me,” letting loose with, “If love ain’t dead, I’m gonna kill it/’Cause it’s killing me.”\n\n“Cuz I Love You” features notable guest appearances from Missy Elliott (“Tempo”) and Gucci Mane (“Exactly How I Feel”), but otherwise this is all about Lizzo, down to her sensual “Lingerie,” where she closes out the release with a saucy come-on: “Hair down, moonlit, look at my lipstick.”\n\nEven if you don’t fall in lust with Lizzo, you’re likely to fall in love.\n\nLizzo\n\n\"Cuz I Love You\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMatt Simons seems to be an unflappable guy. He’s a genial singer-songwriter originally from California, but now based in Brooklyn. He’s got a deceptive “Everyman” air about him, relatable and generally easygoing.\n\nSimons breezes through the songs of his new “After the Landslide” like a contestant killing it on “The Voice.” He’s a crowd-pleaser, even if you can see (almost) every line coming a mile away, and he sings with an unassuming delivery tweaked with natural-born soul.\n\nHe sounds a lot like John Mayer, and that’s OK.\n\nOn “Summer With You,” Simons earnestly sings about “that summer with you,” reminiscing about looking at meteor showers at 3 a.m. in search of the meaning of life. He employs transparent reverse psychology on “Not Falling Apart,” lying his way through lines like, “You’re not the girl in every song I write … You were never the one for me … There’s not a freckle on your face that I’m missing.”\n\nSimons usually keeps it positive – tapping into an infectious sing-along on “Made It Out Alright,” offering encouragement and support on “Open Up,” grandly putting his heart on the line on the moving title track and then slyly showing his best Mayer-esque confidence on “If I Was Your Man.”\n\nHe sounds genuinely casual most of the time, be it in “We Can Do Better’s” brassy call for positivity or even in the bluesy “It’s You,” which only makes the point that he can sing blues if he must (though it’s not his forte).\n\nAnd when Simons takes a dark turn, he’s soberingly effective. On “Dust,” featuring Betty Who, he sternly warns a troublesome ex, “Don’t kick the dust up, just ’cause you’re lonely.” And on the hymnal-ish “Amy’s Song,” Simons deals a gut-punch to those who reject LGBTQ family and friends in the name of religion: “Does your god really give a damn? Does it make her less of a woman? Does it make him less of a man?”\n\nUltimately, Simons is comfortably familiar and routinely satisfying.\n\nMatt Simons\n\n\"After the Landslide\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMissyou's emotions are tough to hear\n\nMissyou’s “YourBody” sounds like the breakup album of Trent Reznor and Taylor Swift.\n\nThe alt-rock release is dark and electrified, with Missyou frontman Blaise Beyhan treading on grim sonic territory in the same realm as Reznor’s Nine Inch Nails, while thematically his bitter disappointment about a dysfunctional relationship aligns with Swift.\n\nExcept Beyhan isn’t shaking anything off. Instead of shrugging that “haters gonna hate,” he hangs up in the refrain “None of us are getting out alive” on the track “closetoyou.”\n\n“YourBody” is bleakly compelling like that, with Beyhan stewing in the emotional cauldron of betrayal and rage.\n\n“Are you with or against me now?” he demands in the stomping “Child 44” before seething about, “Using bullets like ‘I love you, but I’m not in love with you anymore’.” And fear and sensuality intertwine on the title track, a desolate song that sounds like ambient music for a funeral pierced by static and flashes of rock, while Beyhan issues something that feels more like a threat than an invitation: “Neither one of us is going to sleep tonight.”\n\nHowever, the threat level drops on this dense melodrama as Beyhan gets so twisted in his passion that the songs can’t breathe.\n\nThe mopey “Anything” is raw at first – “What happened to me and you? What happened to telling the truth?” – and then Beyhan’s unmitigated pain collapses into “Would’ve done anything for you.” Meanwhile, his obsessions ultimately force “Timid & Timbuktu” to get lost in space, and the unchecked nervous energy of the self-indulgent “Know It All” results in an uncomfortable listening experience.\n\nTo be fair, it isn’t realistic to wrap feelings of anger and pain in tidy three- and four-minute packages. It’s harder than that to move on from hurt, as difficult as that is to hear.\n\nMissyou\n\n\"YourBody\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nIcelandic-Canadian singer is universal\n\nLindy Vopnfjord is from a small and very specific community that many may never have heard of – he’s an Icelandic-Canadian from Manitoba – but his music couldn’t be more universal.\n\nVopnfjord, who now lives in Toronto, gets in touch with those Icelandic roots on his new “You Will Know When It’s Right,” a collaboration with the Icelandic band Nydonsk recorded in Reykjavik. The release also includes a live version of Vopnfjord’s song “Lover Sister,” performed with Nydonsk at Reykjavik’s Eldborg Harpa concert hall.\n\nThe first few notes of opening cut “Love Me Like That” show that Vopnfjord could be from anywhere; the track’s jangly flow and well-branded refrain are trademarks of folk-pop-rock songs around the world.\n\nThe nostalgia of “You Will Know It’s Right” is broadly relatable, and Vopnfjord does hint at his background at times, as on the full-bodied “Standing on the Sea” where he wistfully sings, “The nights are cold here, cold as hell,” and adds, “It’s a nice place to visit, but you wouldn’t want to stay.” However, there’s a distinctly American/country-music twist to ‘How Did We Get Away,” a bittersweet reflection on lost friendship.\n\nBeatles said it’s all you need.” And though there are clear Beatles influences in Vopnfjord’s melodies, his voice is more akin to Rod Stewart, distinctively raspy and endearing.\n\nHe also charms with his call for understanding and togetherness. On the quirky ballad “I’m So Hi,” he sings, “Speak your mind across party lines if you’ve got something to say.” And on the more romantic “Our Greatest Irony,” he offers, “It could be I’m just right for you, even if I’m against you.”\n\nThere’s some sameness to the tracks that slows the flow of the low-key “You Will Know When It’s Right.” But the audience’s warm auction to the live rendition of “Lover Sister” provides a comforting finale.\n\nLindy Vopnfjord\n\n\"You Will Know When It's Right\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/07/01/iowa-state-fair-grandstand-concert-lineup-2021-tickets-chris-stapleton-blake-shelton-styx-beach-boys/5299507001/", "title": "Iowa State Fair Grandstand 2021: Your concert lineup guide", "text": "From country artists Chris Stapleton and Sam Hunt to rhythm and blues group Boyz II Men, Christian artists Casting Crowns, classic rockers Styx, metal's Five Finger Death Punch and the good old Beach Boys and Doobie Brothers, the 2021 Iowa State Fair Grandstand lineup has something for everyone.\n\nHere's a closer look at the acts and what it'll cost to see them at the Grandstand:\n\nCasting Crowns with special guest Jordan Feliz\n\nShowtime: 8 p.m. Thursday, Aug.12\n\nGenre: Christian\n\nTicket prices: $25-$50\n\nThe award-winning Christian music group Casting Crowns consisting of Mark Hall (lead singer/songwriter), Melodee DeVevo (violin, cello, vocals), Brian Scoggin (drums), Megan Garrett (piano, keyboards, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), Chris Huffman (bass guitar, vocals) and Josh Mix (lead guitar, vocals) have sold more than 11 million albums to date.\n\nCasting Crowns has earned several notable accolades, including a Grammy in 2005 for \"Lifesong,\" 18 GMA Dove Awards and four American Music Awards.\n\nTheir Christian radio hits include \"Who Am I,\" \"Praise You In This Storm\" and \"Voice of Truth.\" Casting Crowns' tours have taken them to 140 cities around the world.\n\nSpecial guest Jordan Feliz moved up the gospel music ranks with his first radio single, \"The River.\" The track was named American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' Christian Music Song of the Year for 2017 and earned Feliz his first gold record certification.\n\nMore:Iowa State Fair free stage lineup features the Nadas, Tony!

He killed it, he killed it.\"\n\nZac Brown Band long ago proved their badass bona fides at Summerfest, as one of the most frequent amphitheater headliners over the past decade.\n\nSo in the battle of back-to-back bearded country star Summerfest headliners, who was better?\n\nWell, both acts put on smoking two hour sets for packed crowds. But I’m going to have to give Stapleton the edge this time, for one reason: Zac Brown Band was at a slight disadvantage, with two members missing.\n\nRELATED:Summerfest 2021: Nelly, G-Eazy, Lindsey Stirling, Wilco, and the best and worst of the Milwaukee music festival's Day 2, Weekend 2\n\nRELATED:Summerfest 2021 lineup: Here's the schedule by date, time and stage for the Milwaukee music festival\n\nRELATED:What to know about Summerfest 2021 tickets, COVID-19 rules, shuttle changes, bag policy, new areas and more\n\nRELATED:Here are 14 ways to get into Summerfest 2021 in Milwaukee for free\n\nRELATED:27 must-see acts at Summerfest 2021 in Milwaukee, from Megan Thee Stallion to Guns N' Roses to Chris Stapleton\n\nGuitarist, organist and pianist Coy Bowles, and bassist Matt Mangano, were both absent Friday. No explanation was given on stage, and there’s been no explanation circulating on social media. We emailed the band’s publicists Friday night but did not hear back.\n\nFormer ZBB bassist John Driskell Hopkins, a multi-instrumentalist since 2014, easily slipped back into the role Friday, while Clay Cook compensated for Bowles as best he could on guitar and piano.\n\nBut with Hopkins stuck on one instrument, the band’s signature jam sessions inevitably weren’t quite as extensive Friday, nor quite as frequent. But they were hardly non-existent.\n\nThree songs in, there was ZBB's signature spin on \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia.\" Jimmy De Martini practically channeled the spirit of Charlie Daniels with his hellfire-flirting fiddling, matched for a moment by Brown's own rapid guitar picking, the band huddling together to rock out and raise the heat.\n\nHopkins supplied droll baritone vocals for the Appalachian-inspired \"It's Not OK,\" with several players racing through a lightning round of \"top my riff.\" It served as a tasty appetizer for an extended cover of Marshall Tucker Band's \"Can't You See,\" with Cook on lead vocals, that bounced from Brown's string-plucking guitar solo, to a simmering percussion solo from Daniel De Los Reyes, to Chris Fryar's funky drum display.\n\n\"Can't You See\" also showcased a new addition to the touring band this year, Caroline Jones, who busted into some sweet harmonica and chimed in with ethereal vocals. Jones also led a cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"Big Love\" with some big vocals and added a rich new layer to a sublime five-part harmony section for \"Day That I Die.\"\n\nDown a few hands, hearty singalongs like that one became the stars of the show Friday. The crowd reaction to \"Colder Weather\" was so warm Brown was practically glowing, clapping for the crowd, blowing them kisses and pounding his chest in appreciation. The singalongs for escapist anthems \"Knee Deep\" and \"Toes,\" and their signature hit and natural show closer \"Chicken Fried,\" were just as loud and passionate.\n\nThe band also used the set list to preview their forthcoming album \"The Comeback,\" due out next month. Brown was pushing it pretty aggressively, saying he worked harder on it than anything else, and new songs like the anthemic \"Slow Burn,\" the whimsical \"Same Boat\" and the '50s R&B-flavored \"Old Love Song\" were slickly presented Friday, but it's going to take several more listens until they become set-list favorites.\n\nBut to fill out the encore, ZBB did something really inspired, playing a medley of covers everyone in the crowd knew by heart, with a different member fronting each one. Hopkins brought the menace over towering guitars for Metallica's \"Enter Sandman.\" Fryar kept the rhythm while singing Cheap Trick's \"I Want You To Want Me,\" while De Los Reyes relished his rare opportunity to be center stage on Ritchie Valens' \"La Bamba.\"\n\nBrown sang Elton John's \"Rocket Man,\" Jones covered Phil Collins' \"In the Air Tonight,\" and Cook took the reins for 4 Non Blondes' \"What's Up?\" And for about 60 glorious seconds, the amphitheater felt like Camp Randall on game day when De Martini rapped the Badgers' unofficial anthem, House of Pain's \"Jump Around.\"\n\n\"We've been daydreaming about this for a long time,\" Brown said at one point, relishing the harmonious roar of thousands.\n\n\"This is the America that I know.\"\n\nGabby Barrett battles sound issues\n\nZac Brown Band traditionally hasn’t brought out a buzzy opening act for their tours, but they nabbed one of Nashville’s brightest new talents with Gabby Barrett.\n\nOn Thursday, the former “American Idol” contestant nabbed four CMA Award nominations — more than any other female artist this year — for song and single of the year (for “The Good Ones”), new artist and female vocalist.\n\nSo what a shame you could barely hear her vocals over her thunderous three-piece backing band for the first few songs of her 45-minute set.\n\nOnce the bass-rattling drummer took a breather, Barrett’s pristine vocals filled the room for an acoustic medley of hymns (performed with her husband, former “Idol” contestant Cade Foehner, on vocals and guitar) that peaked with a stunning version of “How Great Thou Art” that recalled Brandi Carlile in its vocal splendor.\n\nIt was one of several covers Friday, performed with mixed results. Barrett got to play rock star for Guns N’ Roses’ “Paradise City” and Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” with stadium-shaking vocals that would impress Axl Rose and Steve Perry — but her cover of Miranda Lambert’s “Little Red Wagon” missed the sass of the original.\n\nAnd by the time she closed with her huge crossover hit “I Hope” — a love song on the surface before the cruel and clever lyrical twist in the chorus — the sound issues had been remedied, although Barrett relinquished vocal control to thousands of fans belting along.\n\nZac Brown Band set list\n\n1. “Homegrown”\n\n2. “Keep Me In Mind”\n\n3. “The Devil Went Down To Georgia” (Charlie Daniels Band cover)\n\n4. “No Hurry”\n\n5. “It’s Not OK”\n\n6. “Same Boat”\n\n7. “As She’s Walking Away”\n\n8. “Can’t You See” (Marshall Tucker Band cover)\n\n9. “Tomorrow Never Comes\"\n\n10. “Day That I Die”\n\n11. “Knee Deep” (acoustic)\n\nIntermission\n\n12. “Someone I Used To Know”\n\n13. “Old Love Song”\n\n14. “Big Love” (Fleetwood Mac cover)\n\n15. “Colder Weather”\n\n16. “Slow Burn”\n\n17. “Toes”\n\n18. “Beautiful Drug”\n\nEncore\n\n19. “Enter Sandman” (brief Metallica cover)\n\n20. “I Want You To Want Me” (brief Cheap Trick cover)\n\n21. “In the Air Tonight” (brief Phil Collins cover)/\n\n22. “La Bamba” (brief Ritchie Valens cover)\n\n23. “Jump Around” (brief House of Pain cover)\n\n24. “What’s Up?” (brief 4 Non Blondes cover)\n\n25. “Rocket Man” (brief Elton John cover)\n\n26. “Chicken Fried”\n\nContact Piet at (414) 223-5162 or plevy@journalsentinel.com.

Pitchfork raved that Brettin \"does an interesting job crafting elaborately layered songs that still have a sort of four-track sound. When Brettin reaches in this way, his tunes leave DeMarco at the door and instead seek the territory explored by bands like under-appreciated ’90s Brian Wilson worshippers the High Llamas.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 1.

And they're still going strong two albums later, touring on \"Let Me Get By,\" which inspired a PopMatters writer to rave that it's \"finally the record that capitalizes on the promise this collective has had from the start.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 2.

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” But by the time it hit the streets in 1968, the Zombies had already broken up. Their masterpiece’s reputation just kept growing, though. And they eventually got back together, entertaining several generations worth of fans with some of rock and roll’s most timeless songs.

The award was for \"The Muscle Shoals Recordings,\" which inspired PopMatters to rave that \"Everything that makes the SteelDrivers, fundamentally, the SteelDrivers, is present and laid out on the table totally disrobed, with no frilly affectations or studio voodoo accentuating their raw mix.\" Or maybe you'd be swayed more by Adele, who says, “They’re a blues, country, bluegrass, swagger band, and they are brilliant.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 15.

Nick has been the Jonas most likely to succeed from the day he and his brothers signed a major-label deal (although Joe may have been the most crush-worthy to younger Jonas Brothers fans).

New singer Edith Frances proved an energetic onstage presence, flailing her hair as she hopped up and down on a stage bathed in smoke.

Founding drummer Bill Ward left the fold in 2012, saying he wouldn’t return until he was given a “signable contract.” But Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler carried on, releasing “13” in 2013, and embarking on a world tour, which was pretty amazing.

His hits include country chart-toppers \"Rain is a Good Thing,\" \"Someone Else Calling You Baby,\" \"I Don't Want This Night to End,\" \"Drunk on You,\" \"That's My Kind of Night,\" \"Drink a Beer,\" \"Play It Again,\" \"I See You,” “Kick the Dust Up” and “Strip it Down.” Little Big Town and Dustin Lynch will open the show.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 22.

And they apparently dined heavily on \"Beggars Banquet,\" given the Jaggeresque vocals. But like Royal Trux before them, Twin Peaks take the Stones' unpolished essence as a starting point, arriving at a sound that's even more unpolished. In a good way. It's a low-key brand of rock and roll, the kind that sounds like it was captured as the sun was coming up after a long night of living the rock-and-roll lifestyle. The next time a self-loathing Boomer wants to tell you rock-and-roll is dying, throw this on and leave the room so they come to terms with the fact that it's not rock and roll that's dying.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 22.

I'm on board with her singing. And so was the PopMatters critic who wrote: \"Queasy carnival music, hoodoo blues stomps, country waltz ballads, primitive rock and jazzy inflections coalesce and flow around the anchor of Hernandez's rich voice, a contralto rife with character and heartrending soul.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 23.

Skiba’s first onstage appearance with the band was hailed in OC Weekly as “the best they’ve sounded in over a decade.” So there's that. They've topped the Modern Rock charts three times, with \"All the Small Things,\" \"I Miss You\" and this year's \"Bored to Death,\" their first release with Skiba. They're joined on this tour by A Day to Remember and All Time Low.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

But Trivium's ascendancy began in earnest in 2005 with the aptly titled \"Ascendancy,\" their first release on Roadrunner. And they're still going strong with a great new album \"Silence in the Snow.\" It's their seventh release and as the review in Alternative Press was right to note, \"the Florida foursome still manage to top themselves with each outing.\" The twin-guitar solos alone would make this album — and this concert — worth your while.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

She began singing traditional country fare and was adored by critics, but her debut album (1997's \"No Place That Far\") didn't sell. The vocalist updated her image, commercialized her sound and wound up with such major hits as \"Suds in the Bucket\" and a cover of Edwin McCain's \"I Could Not Ask For More.\" Along the way, there was a stint on \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

But they broke through in a big way in 2013 when a synth-pop song called \"Closer\" topped the U.S. dance charts, giving them their first Top 40 entry on the Hot 100 in the process. The synth-driven pop sensibilities driving \"Closer\" up the chart are also very much on display on their new album, \"Love You to Death,\" from the candy-coated New Wave soul of \"Boyfriend\" to the album-closing \"Hang On to the Night,\" a dreamy synth-pop ballad that could be their most contagious track yet.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

They're here in support of a new album, \"Mark of the Blade,\" their first to feature clean vocals from singer Phil Bozeman.

But that also means it's wildly entertaining, like the Blues Brothers playing the soundtrack to \"The Little Shop of Horrors,\" as Mark Ronson would produce it. Kelvin Swaby definitely has the vocal grit to tap into that classic Memphis soul vibe. And they clearly know their way around a memorable hook.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24.

The A.V. Club responded to the new release with: \"Overall, this is undeniable rap therapy.

Of course they both sold out before we even made it to September. These shows are part of the \"Sunshine Superman\" 50th anniversary, but whether that means he'll be playing the entire album is a bit unclear. The psychedelic icon says, “I am delighted to be going on tour throughout North America, to thank all who have followed my work from the beginning -- and all who have just discovered me now. I celebrate my 50th year in music to re-affirm my poet’s role to unite us with our deeper conscious Self. My ‘Sunshine Superman’ album led the way to establish the need for the journey within and T.M Meditation the way to go.

Subsequent modern-rock-radio hits include \"Something Is Not Right With Me,\" \"Audience,\" \"Louder Than Ever,\" \"Miracle Mile\" and last year's \"All This Could Be Yours.\" Paste Magazine says \"Hold My Home,\" their latest, is \"arguably the strongest record – with the most consistent highlights – that the band has yet to deliver, and it bodes well for their future.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 27.

Bassist Matthew Whipple says of the album, “We wanted to make a more energetic record. I personally looked to artists like Springsteen, '70s Bowie, the Smiths, the Cure, Neil Young as inspiration for — not really for sound as much as for that dichotomy of bands who were entertainers still making, at times, weird dark music and writing songs that seem totally over-the-top by today's rock band standards.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 27.

Eminem returned the favor with a guest rap on \"C'mon Let Me Ride,\" the lead single from 2013's \"Don't Look Down,\" which showed a lot of promise but failed to set the charts on fire.

There's a hint of \"Thriller\"-era Michael Jackson to the synth hook of the second song but most tracks work their way back around to that glorious racket Matthew Iwanusa likes to stir up on guitar.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 28.

And although there’s no reprise of that collaboration on 2013's \"Signed and Sealed in Blood,\" there are plenty of songs that leave no doubt as to exactly what it is about these Boston punks that made a guy like Springsteen want to meet them in the first place.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 29.

But after hitting No. 3 with 1996’s “MTV Unplugged,” they fell on hard times as Layne Staley struggled with the drug addiction that would claim his life in 2002. Primary songwriter Jerry Cantrell, founding drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Inez, who joined in 1993, got back together three years after Staley’s death with a new singer, William DuVall. Since then, they’ve sent four singles to the top of Billboard’s mainstream-rock chart — “Check My Brain,” “Your Decision,” “Hollow” and “Stone.” Their latest album, “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here,” debuted at No. 2 on Billboard’s album chart while earning a rave from No Ripcord, whose writer weighed in with “ ‘The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here’ is up there with the best Alice in Chains albums, with each track a conquest of structure and composition.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

And they conquered alternative radio with \"Fall In Love,\" which filters the best parts of disco and bachelor-pad music through a more contemporary sensibility with the added value of a timeless melody and the sense that there's something emotional at stake on the lyrical front. And there's a new one due just after their appearance here.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30. Marquee Theatre, 730 N.

Of course, by this point, they’ve left the alternative-country and indie-folk labels by the wayside. They’re just what they are. And by the time this concert rolls around, they'll have released \"Away,\" their first album in three years, which we're told is a \"radically different\" affair. Sheff recorded the album with an almost entirely new cast of musicians, most coming from the jazz and avant-garde worlds, and the result is a stripped-down embodiment of Sheff's revival through music after a period of significant loss and change.\n\nDetails: 8:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

The determination will be for one quarter.\n\nStudents who test positive for COVID-19 will be required to do virtual leaning until it is safe to return.\n\nStudents must wear masks when in school. Masks can only be removed for eating and some limited physical activities. Students also need to do self-health check every 24 hours.\n\nBrown Deer School District\n\nFamilies in Brown Deer will choose between a full virtual learning option or a five-phase gradual return to face-to-face learning.\n\nThe first day of school will be Sept. 1 and all students K4-12 will start learning virtually from home. On Sept. 21, which is Phase 2, students in grades K4-5, 6 and 9 will return to school two days a week and learn virtually three days a week, while students in grades 7, 8 and 10-12 will continue with all virtual learning.

The updated plan was presented at the Cedarburg School Board's July 29 meeting. .\n\nStaff and students will be required to wear masks when indoors and/or when social distancing can't be maintained. The Cedarburg School Board voted 5-1 to require masks for everyone after a petition was started by Cedarburg High School students. It had 1,462 signatures.\n\nStaff and students are also expected to monitor for any respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath, new loss or taste of smell every morning and throughout the day. These are common symptoms of COVID-19. If students are experiencing any symptoms, they should stay home from school. Signs encouraging hand washing and sanitizing, as well as hand washing/sanitizing stations, will be within schools.\n\nThe window to select either the in-person or virtual learning option begins July 31 and runs through Aug. 7. The board is planning to have a final plan approved Aug. 19.\n\nCudahy School District\n\nThe Cudahy School Board approved a plan July 27 providing families with two options: an in-person learning model with remote/blended learning as needed to maintain safety measures, as well as a full-time, virtual learning model.\n\nThe in-person model would see elementary and middle school students attend school four days a week Monday through Thursday. Students would do independent learning activities at home on Friday, which would also be used as a day to clean all school buildings. Cudahy High School students will attend school in-person two days a week and virtually two days a week.

Students in the second half of the alphabet (also keeping households together) will attend in-person Tuesday and Thursday while having virtual instruction Monday and Wednesday and unstructured learning Friday. The only difference from the A/B cohort model schedule is that K4 and K5 students will attend four days per week, Monday through Thursday, with unstructured learning Friday.\n\nAny student can opt out of the A/B day cohort model and attend the virtual only model, every day, Mondays through Thursdays with unstructured learning Fridays.\n\nThe district is also requiring masks to be worn by all students, staff and school visitors on all district property to start the school year.\n\nFranklin Public Schools\n\nThe district plans to return to in-person instruction five days a week this fall and follow its regular schedule for student attendance. Students with medical conditions or students who live with a family member with a medical condition that could be at risk due to COVID-19 are eligible for virtual learning at home.\n\nA majority of parents supported a full and consistent five-day-a-week return to school over a schedule that mixes virtual and in-person instruction, according to a report on a survey.\n\nUniversal precautions will focus on modified movement patterns, protocols for hand washing/sanitizing and personal protective equipment. Staff are required to wear masks or face shields when they come within 6 feet of someone with additional protocols for where and when they can be removed. Students are required to wear masks during portions of the day, including passing times, entry/exit into the building and other high traffic areas. Additional student mask wearing protocols will be developed closer to the start of school.\n\nGermantown School District\n\nThe district will have both a face-to-face classroom experience and virtual option for students. The plan is still being finalized. A survey will be sent to all parents on which option they prefer.\n\nGlendale-River Hills School District\n\nThe district will start the school year virtually. A plan is being developed to phase students into on-campus learning.\n\nGrafton School District\n\nStudents will return to school for face-to-face instruction, with health measures, with a virtual learning option available.\n\nThe district also changed the wording of its policy on masks from \"students will wear face coverings\" to \"students must wear face coverings,\" but gave staff discretion as to when to require students to wear face masks.\n\nSpecifically, students will wear masks when its not feasible to social distance indoors, while riding the school bus, when arriving at school and classrooms and during dismissal while walking from classrooms to outdoors, if exhibiting symptoms of illness (including fever, chills and loss of taste). Staff members are required to wear face masks while moving through the schools and in classrooms or outdoors when social distancing is not feasible.\n\nElementary students, whether attending virtually or in person, will be assigned a homeroom teacher. Virtual learners will take their reading, writing and math classes live and will do other classes, such as science and social studies, on their own time. At school, physical education classes will be held either outdoors or in gyms with more space.\n\nSecondary students who are doing the virtual learning option will also take their classes live and will follow the schedule consistent with in-person learning. Virtual students may be assigned alternative activities based on the specific material needs to complete in-person tasks. The experience of performance-related courses such as automotives, culinary, music, STEM and art may be significantly different in the virtual setting.\n\nGreendale School District\n\nGreendale Schools is offering families a choice of in-person or fully digital learning when school resumes Sept. 1, according to its reopening plan, which can be found here.\n\nFor elementary school students, in-person learning will be four days a week in-person, with Wednesdays being a digital learning day for 'specials classes' and a deep-cleaning of the school buildings, according to Kitty Goyette, communications director for Greendale Schools.\n\nFor middle and high school students, students who are enrolled for in-person learning will be divided into groups, so appropriate social distancing can occur. Those groups will meet in-person two days a week, with digital learning planned for the other three days, and Wednesday being designated for deep cleaning.\n\nAt all levels, students learning in-person will be placed in learning groups of approximately 15 students in a regular classroom to allow for physical distancing, Goyette said.\n\nStudents who are enrolled in digital learning will be assigned to a fully digital class from 8:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. each day.\n\nThe health guidelines for the district can be found here.\n\nGreenfield School District\n\nGreenfield will begin with an all virtual setting at all grade levels, with a gradual phase-in to in-person learning beginning with elementary students, followed by middle school, and then high school, according to a school board document.\n\nThe start date for the year will also move back a week to Sept. 8.\n\n\"The virtual learning environment will be significantly different from what students experienced this spring during the time of emergency remote learning and all learning will be facilitated by School District of Greenfield teachers, using the district’s curriculum,\" the document said.\n\nThe board will meet on Sept. 28 to plan when to phase back to in-person classes.\n\nParents can also choose to send their children to school virtually for the entire fall semester if:\n\ntheir child/children has a documented, underlying health condition that will require them to learn virtually.\n\nthey are not comfortable sending their child/children to school.\n\nHamilton School District\n\nFamilies will be given a choice between traditional in-person or virtual online instruction. District officials are asking families to make a selection during online registration Aug. 3-10.\n\nDuring the traditional classroom setting, students will attend classes five days a week, but with many safety measures to improve social distancing and prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nClassrooms will look different to provide social distancing, masks will be required and the use of common supplies and equipment will be minimized. If schools are closed because of the coronavirus, students will learn at home until it is safe to return to school.\n\nIf there is an extended school closure, school will be in session five days a week with teachers posting new instruction virtually Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Wednesday will be set aside for reteaching, class meetings, small groups, one-on-ones, feedback and check ins.\n\nDuring virtual learning, students will work with peers and teachers online and also independent offline. Lessons will be scheduled each day to include a whole class, small group and individual activities.\n\nStudents who choose a virtual option will be able to return to an in-person model at the semester.\n\nHartland Lakeside School District\n\nParents will have the option to chose between in-person, blended and virtual learning options, according to a reopening plan.\n\nFor those who choose in-person, students will attend class five days a week. The blended option includes two days a week in person, and three days virtual. The virtual option includes five days a week virtual learning.\n\nThe first day of school for students is Sept. 1.\n\nParents who choose the in-person option will need to perform a daily health check, according district guidelines. Students who attend virtually will be expected to also interact with the classroom.\n\nThe school year will start with a \"soft start,\" as students will be divided into two groups to attend the first week of school on two separate days.\n\n\"A soft start will allow teachers to meet with smaller groups of students as they acclimate them to the new routines and transition them back to school,\" according to the reopening plan.\n\nKettle Moraine School District\n\nThe district plans to start the school year with face-to-face instruction that includes health measures while allowing students at all grade levels the option to continue virtual learning.\n\nStudents returning to school for in-person instruction will have education on hand-washing, covering coughs, physical distancing and more directed movement.\n\nThe district will provide masks and face shields in its facilities. Plexiglas \"sneeze shields\" will also be installed in high-traffic areas such as office spaces and health rooms. Cleaning will be increased and drinking fountains will be turned off. Only bottle-fill stations will be used. Use of cubbies, lockers and locker rooms will be eliminated or modified. Arrival, dismissal and passing times will also be staggered. No field trips or visitors will be allowed. Students and staff are also expected to screen themselves at home for symptoms.\n\nIsolation rooms will also be set up for students and staff who are symptomatic at school to stay in until they're allowed to go home. People in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be quarantined for 14 days to mitigate the spread. Students who repeatedly disregard safety protocols will be assigned alternate learning environments and could face other repercussions.\n\nElementary students will be kept with their homeroom class all day, including recess and lunch. Art, music and physical education classes will be held on a weekly rotation.\n\nLake Country School District\n\nStudents have three options: in-person, hybrid -and virtual access to the regular classrooms live feed of instruction, discussion and peer group virtual interaction from home. In-person instruction will be five days a week. Students can change their preference of in-person or virtual at any time.\n\nMore information will be on the district's website at www.lcs.k12.wi.us.\n\nMaple Dale-Indian Hill School District\n\nSchools will reopen on Sept. 1 with a hybrid model that combines in-person learning two days per week and virtual learning three days per week.\n\nOne group of students will attend in-person on Mondays and Tuesdays, and another group of students will attend in-person on Thursdays and Fridays. Both groups will attend virtually on Wednesdays.\n\nThe district is tentatively planning to resume five-day, in-person learning on Oct. 5. The district will also allow a virtual option for families.\n\nMenomonee Falls School District\n\nThe Menomonee Falls School Board approved a plan July 27 to offer two choices to students and their families.\n\nThe first choice is instruction that could move between three models — in-person, hybrid or virtual — using a decision matrix of health indicators and attendance. No parent action is required.\n\nThe second choice is a fully-virtual learning model for a one-semester commitment. Registration was required before Aug. 3.\n\nMore information about the instructional models can be found here.\n\nMequon-Thiensville School District\n\nThe district has decided to start the school year with virtual learning after previously deciding to start in-person.\n\nIn a letter to district parents, district superintendent Matthew Joynt said the Mequon-Thiensville School Board voted Aug. 17 to start the year virtually due to the current state of COVID-19 spread in the Mequon-Thiensville zip codes.\n\nJoynt said the district's goal remains to return to on campus instruction for the 2020-21 school year as soon as possible, saying the district will continue to provide updates on its website.\n\nMerton School District\n\nThe district will discuss and vote on its reopening plan at its Aug. 3 school board meeting.\n\nAt this time, the district is continuing to plan its schools around the idea of Waukesha County's “Stay Safe to Stay Open.” The district will comply will all state mandates such as the mandatory mask mandate.\n\nThe district will have as much social distancing as possible, restructure staff and student movement throughout the day before and after school, new hand washing, sanitizing and cleaning practices throughout the district and develop instructional methods and practices to maintain distance between students and staff.\n\nMilwaukee Public Schools\n\nStudents will begin the year online and return to the classroom in phases when the coronavirus has subsided.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Schools board approved the $90 million plan July 16.\n\nThe school year will begin on virtual platforms on Aug. 17 or Sept. 1, depending on their school calendar. The online phase is projected to last 30 to 45 days, after which students would alternate two days in school and three online at home, and then fully return to classes once that was deemed safe.\n\nMukwonago Area School District\n\nAs of July 27, when the school board affirmed its approach with coronavirus mitigation measures, Mukwonago schools plan to open to face-to-face, five-day-per-week in-person learning on Sept. 1.\n\n\"While we will seek a traditional reopening to the greatest extent possible, clearly there will be mitigation measures in place to ensure the safety of our students, staff, and community,\" the district said on its website.\n\nThe district will, however, offer a virtual learning option for concerned parents. The website includes links to a slideshow presentation of that option for 5-year-old kindergarten through sixth grade and another for grades 7 to 12. A form for virtual learning options is also accessible from the website.\n\nAs for the mitigation plans, the district, noting its actions will be based on CDC guidelines, includes detailed links of what will be involved to keep school buildings relatively safe.\n\nIt's all covered in the pandemic information portion of the district website.\n\nMuskego-Norway School District\n\nAll schools will allow students to return virtually or in-person this fall using a three-tiered plan, the Muskego-Norway School Board decided July 13.\n\nEnrollment applications were made available to parents through a survey July 20. Students will automatically be enrolled in the district’s in-person program unless a virtual learning application has been submitted.\n\nPrecautions being taken at schools for the return of in-person learning include: provided thermometers and face masks, isolation rooms for individuals with COVID symptoms, fresh air intake, sneeze guards where distancing is limited, outdoor learning areas, virtual field trips, staggered entry and exit points and more.\n\nParents must reserve bus service, as the district is planning to reduce ridership. Students will be assigned seats and must wear face masks. The bus windows will remain open within reason, and a ventilation system will help to circulate the air.\n\nTier 1 of the plan offers families in-person and remote options. The start of the school year will be used to teach and practice distancing protocols. Face coverings will be provided for students and staff.\n\nTier 2 — which would begin if coronavirus concerns increase — would see elementary and middle school students attend in-person classes in small groups using virtual instruction. High school students would alternate weekly between in-person and virtual instruction.\n\nTier 3 would have all students learning from home.\n\nAccording to the district’s survey data, 82% of parents and 79% of staff prefer in-person learning.\n\nNew Berlin School District\n\nThe New Berlin School Board approved in-person learning five days a week with a virtual learning option available for the first semester during an administration and re-entry task force presentation July 20.\n\nThe district will require staff to wear face masks; however, students are only encouraged to wear them, according to the district’s presentation draft. Administrators will consider mandatory mask wearing for students in grades four through 12 based on guidance from health officials.\n\nSafety recommendations made during the presentation include: open classroom doors, assigned bus seats, encouraged distancing during recess, designated lunchtime eating areas with grab-and-go school-provided meals, signs to remind students not to share supplies and more.\n\nA hybrid learning model will be considered if health concerns become heightened. This method would assign students to two groups, with one group learning in person Mondays and Tuesdays and the other on Thursdays and Fridays. All students would learn virtually on Wednesdays while the building is deep-cleaned.\n\nFamilies will receive a survey July 27 that includes virtual and in-person enrollment options for fall. According to a school district family survey with 3,055 responses, in-person learning was preferred by 63.5% of elementary respondents and 56% of secondary respondents.\n\nNicolet Union High School District\n\nThe Nicolet School Board voted July 27 to start the school year with remote learning with the goal of eventually progressing to phase three, an in-person model, when health and safety allow for it.\n\nDuring the remote model, all classes will have an expectation to engage in both real-time, face-to-face or recorded or self-paced, learning activities. Students will have set learning expectations and regular daily attendance, grades, work and assessments will all be tracked.\n\nIn phase two, students split time between in-school and remote learning. Students would be divided into two groups, A and B, attending school on A and B days. Half the district's students would attend in-person classes in the morning on A days, while the other half — the B group — would learn remotely. The roles would flip on B days and the B group would attend in-person classes in the morning and the A group would learn remotely. All students would learn remotely in the afternoon every day. A remote-only learning option will be available for families who do not feel comfortable having their children return to school.\n\nDuring phase three, all students spend their time in the school building and resume a mostly normal school day schedule. This would involve enhanced cleaning protocols, adjustments to how students enter and exit buildings and changes to lunch services. A remote-only learning option will also be available during this phase.\n\nNorth Lake School District\n\nThe school will reopen for students for in-person instruction five days a week beginning Sept. 1.\n\nDesks and tables will be positioned 3 to 6 feet apart to provide protection for staff and students, according to the district's website.\n\nThe district will also have yellow tape in the building to ensure two-lane traffic in the hallways.\n\nThe district is also allowing virtual learning for special circumstances.\n\nOak Creek-Franklin School District\n\nAfter originally deciding to return in-person five days a week, the Oak Creek-Franklin School Board has decided to start the year remotely and implement phases for returning face-to-face due to current COVID-19 rates in the community.\n\nIn a letter to parents on the district's website, the district said its teachers will provide a daily schedule with instructional time, office hours for students and parents, synchronous (live) and asynchronous (non-live) instruction with specified minutes and implement grade level learning requirements for remote learning. Live lessons will be recorded for students to review if they are not able to attend the synchronous lesson. Asynchronous instruction will consist of recorded instruction with learning activities to be completed and submitted to teachers. Student engagement and completion of assignments will be part of a student's attendance.\n\nThe district said it considers attendance an important measure of student engagement and a predictor of student success. Students will be considered absent if they do not attend the synchronous lessons or complete assignments or asynchronous assignments. Staff will follow-up with absent students.\n\nMore information is available on the district website.\n\nOconomowoc Area School District\n\nThe Oconomowoc School Board voted 5-2 Aug. 4 to start the school year with a cohort model at the elementary level and an every other day, split attendance model called the Purple and Gold Model at the intermediate and high school levels, with the board revisiting this decision every two weeks when school is started after a review of local health conditions and school level health data with input from the district's medical advisory committee.\n\nThe elementary level plan will see a group of students assigned to one primary teacher. The students will remain as static as possible throughout the day. Specials staff will rotate into the primary classroom of the cohort unless a classroom or learning space is deemed safe for use (i.e. outdoor learning space, multi-purpose room, gymnasium).\n\nThe intermediate level plan will see students divided into two groups, Purple and Gold, based on their last name. Students with last names starting with A through K will be in the Purple Group while those with last names L through Z will be in the Gold Group. Students will attend school for a full school day on their designated group day at school. On the opposite day when an intermediate student is not at school and is working virtually, he or she will take part in both synchronous, or live, experiences and asynchronous, or non-live, learning experiences.\n\nThe high school level plan also sees students divided into two groups, Purple and Gold, based on their last names. Students with last names A through K will be in the Purple Group and students with last names L through Z will be in the Gold Group. Students will attend school for a full school day on their designated group day and then virtually on their assigned group day for that model. Some days will be College, Career and Life Readiness Days in which specific grade levels report to campus for Career, College and Life Readiness activities.\n\nMore information about the elementary level plan can be found here; the intermediate plan here and the high school plan here.\n\nPalmyra-Eagle School District\n\nAs of early August, PEASD has chosen to hold classes five days a week in-person once school begins, though there will be a virtual option available \"for those who are not ready to send their students yet,\" said Caitlin Kirchner, the district's public relations coordinator.\n\nIt will be an unusually tidy atmosphere that students find at school, with some outdoor classes to give students a break from mask-wearing.\n\n\"We are requiring masks by all, and upping our sanitation and cleaning practices,\" Kirchner said. \"We hope to implement lots of outdoor learning to ease the mask requirements as we do have plenty of land for everyone to spread out safely. Our plans are to make it as safe as possible, and feel we have an advantage with our smaller class sizes.\n\nPewaukee School District\n\nPewaukee has developed two models, giving parents the option of either enrolling their children in an all-virtual program for nine-week increments or allowing them to begin under a hybrid model that district officials have called a \"soft-open.\"\n\nThe plan, spelled out in a 28-page document on the district's website, describes the in-person hybrid model in which students attend school partly in a virtual setting and partly in-person, progressing through a series of three phases ending in full daily attendance.\n\n\"The reason for the 'soft-open' approach is we will have an extensive plan of procedures, protocols and alterations to our practices that will take some time for staff and students to learn, apply and refine,\" Superintendent Mike Cady said. \"This is far more manageable with smaller numbers of students on campus at any one time. Furthermore, fewer students allows much greater flexibility to employ social distancing and other virus mitigation strategies.\"\n\nThe first phase would involve half the students getting face-to-face instruction on Monday and Tuesday, virtual learning on Thursday and Friday, while the other half would learn their lessons on the opposite schedule. Wednesday would be fully virtual for all students during the first phase, allowing for what district officials call a \"deep cleaning\" of school buildings.\n\nDuring the second phase, in-person learning would take place every day but Wednesday.\n\nThe all-virtual option would require nine-week commitments. The plan also has provisions for emergency remote learning.\n\nPort Washington-Saukville School District\n\nStudents in the Port Washington-Saukville School District will be phased into the classroom through a four-step system.\n\nEach phase is dependent on local health conditions. The school district will work with stakeholders to decide when the district should advance to the next phase.\n\nThe district will start with full-time virtual learning. In the second phase, one group of students will attend in-person class on Mondays and Tuesdays, and another group of students will attend in person on Thursdays and Fridays. Both groups will attend virtually on Wednesdays.\n\nThe third phase will bring students back to the classroom four days per week, with a virtual learning option for students who are unable to attend in-person instruction.\n\nThe fourth phase of the plan will bring students back to school for full-time, in-person instruction five days per week.\n\nStudents will be given the opportunity to temporarily remove their masks when the staff determines it can be done so safely.\n\nStudents who refuse to wear a mask when asked will be referred to virtual education and will need to wait until the start of the next semester to apply for in-person learning.\n\nRichmond School District\n\nStudents in the Richmond School District can choose virtual or in-person learning. If it is done virtually, they will be in that environment for a trimester.\n\nMasks will be required and sanitizing stations upon entering and existing buildings will be utilized for in-person instruction. Only one grade will be in the cafeteria at lunch with social distancing and sanitizing before and after lunch. Large indoor and outdoor spaces will be used for learning to increase social distancing.\n\nVirtual instruction will be assigned if a child tests positive for COVID-19 as well as if someone in the same household does or if someone has been in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19.\n\nShorewood School District\n\nStudents will start the school year with a virtual+ learning model, the Shorewood School Board unanimously approved July 28.\n\nThe first day of school will be Sept. 8, and the virtual+ learning model will be in effect at least through Nov. 6, when the district will reassess using gating criteria, a news release from the district said.\n\nThe virtual+ learning model will provide live video classes in which students will have structured schedules to attend live classes with teachers, along with time for teachers and students to check in on any questions and concerns.\n\nThere will also be scheduled in-person access to school buildings and staff for small group and individual education, therapy and counseling services. Masks, social distancing and cleaning of indoor spaces between uses will be required when students and staff are on campuses.\n\nThere will also be limited student supervision at school for families who cannot be home during daytime virtual learning hours. Due to the district's limited capacity, the service is only for students and families who have no other options for child supervision during the school day.\n\nSouth Milwaukee School District\n\nStudents will start the first six weeks of school learning remotely, the school board approved Aug. 5.\n\nAn update will be provided by the board by Sept. 25.\n\nThe fall virtual learning program differs from the spring program. New remote teaching additions include: daily assignments, scheduled live classes, monitored attendance and engagement, required classwork and more.\n\nMeetings with parents, students and teachers will also be virtual through “launchpad meetings” for elementary families between Sept. 1-11, and morning meetings/closing circles for teachers and students at the start and end of each school day.\n\nVirtual plan schedules for elementary and high school students can be seen on pages 13 and 26, respectively, of the South Milwaukee School District’s presentation.\n\nSt. Francis School District\n\nThe St. Francis School District will start the school year virtually with a reassessment date of Sept. 15, according to Mark Elworthy, superintendent of the St. Francis School District.\n\nHowever, for anyone on school property now, all individuals must wear face coverings unless the person is alone in a private office.\n\nStudents will use the educational platforms SeeSaw (K4-3) and Schoology (4-12). These platforms will provide a conferencing solution that will be used by teachers, the district says.\n\nIf in-person instruction resumes, the district is asking families to self-screen their symptoms every day before attending school.\n\nStone Bank School\n\nThough the details are far from final as of Aug. 1, Stone Bank School in Oconomowoc has told parents in a letter that it plans on offering a mix of face-to-face, blended and virtual learning once the school year begins.\n\nAccording to the letter by Superintendent Ryan Krohn, those plans will be finalized in the weeks ahead, following an Aug. 17 school board meeting. A survey that will be sent to parents on Aug. 18 will also help the district finalize its plans.\n\nThe survey will query what options parents prefer and what safety precautions matter most for each student in their households.\n\nKrohn acknowledged the situation is somewhat fluid, for now.\n\nEither way, any in-person instruction will involve a mix of face mask requirements, social distancing and hand sanitation initiatives based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Waukesha County Public Health Department, Krohn said in the letter.\n\nVirtual and blended-learning plans are in the works as well, though very little information was available as of early August.\n\nSwallow School District\n\nAccording to Superintendent Melissa Thompson, the school board's goal remains to reopen Swallow School for face-to-face instruction five days per week, but \"with the understanding that a flexible virtual option will likely be needed for some students all of the time, and a fully virtual option may be needed for all students some of the time.\"\n\nThe Hartland school will use strategies set forth by the Waukesha County Health Public Department and CDC.\n\nWaukesha School District\n\nOn Aug. 12, the school board opted for a hybrid model for middle and high school students, who will attend classes virtually on Monday and alternate between in-person and virtual learning Tuesday through Friday.\n\nFor elementary school grades, students will learn in-person all week, with the district allowing parents to opt for all-virtual learning to alleviate their concerns.\n\nIn a 5-4 vote, the board opted for those details and opted not to adapt a phased-in opening plan that would have began with virtual learning and slowly worked learning plans back to daily in-person classroom settings.\n\nEven with face-to-face learning, the scene won't be quite like the traditional classroom setting. According to a chart previously explaining the options facing parents, it would involve virus mitigation efforts, including required face coverings for both teachers and students, social distancing and temperatures checks of each student, and plenty of hand sanitizing.\n\nWauwatosa School District\n\nThe Wauwatosa School Board voted 6-1 on July 27 to start the school year with two options: a phased, in-person option and a virtual learning option.\n\nThe first phase will see staff get used to the learning environment and safety procedures. Phase two will see students get used to the learning environment and safety procedures and include student and staff cohorts. Student cohorts would attend school two days a week. Phase three is the first full week of school, and it involves a hybrid model. Phase four involves ongoing learning. Options available depending on a medical/public health advisory panel's standards and metrics include classroom learning, which would see a five-day, in-person instruction model; a hybrid model in which students learn at school two days per week and learn virtually from home three days per week, and a virtual learning option in which students do online learning from home four days a week.\n\nStudents and staff will be required to wear masks, which will be provided to those who don't have one. Breaks and other strategies such as contests and games will be incorporated to help the transition at the lower levels. Other health measures include the installation of extra hand-washing and sanitation stations, improving air circulation and quality, increased cleaning and sanitizing of school buildings, student and family self-screening for symptoms and social distancing measures such as furniture reconfiguration in classrooms.\n\nWest Allis-West Milwaukee School District\n\nStudents will return to school Sept. 8 in an all virtual learning format, the West Allis-West Milwaukee School Board on July 27 decided.\n\nThen, depending on health metrics, the district plans to move to distance learning, with two days per week in school and finally in-person learning, which would be five days per week for elementary students and four days per week for secondary students, a district news release said.\n\nParents are asked to select a specific option for their children so the district can plan for once it moves past being all virtual.\n\nStudents and staff will be required to wear masks in schools or on buses when social distancing isn't possible. The district has the inventory to provide each staff member and student with two masks and will provide clear face shields for students and teachers when educationally necessary.\n\nWhitefish Bay School District\n\nWhitefish Bay students will resume school with a hybrid model that combines in-person learning two days per week and virtual learning for three days per week. The district will also allow a full virtual option for families.\n\nStudents with last names starting with A through L will attend school in-person on Monday and Tuesday, and the remainder of the students will attend school in-person on Thursday and Friday. Both groups of students will attend virtually on Wednesday.\n\nThe school district plans to use the hybrid model until the end of the first quarter, at which point the school board will determine whether a change in format is appropriate.\n\nClassrooms will be limited to 13 desks to provide enough space for physical distancing. Face coverings will be required for everyone inside the buildings, except students who need medical exceptions.\n\nVisitors will be limited those deemed as essential. Meetings will be held virtually when possible.\n\nThe full plan is available on the district website.\n\nWhitnall School District\n\nThe Whitnall School Board voted Aug. 17 to approve its reopening plan of in-person learning with health measures, along with a virtual option for families who want it, a letter to parents said.\n\nDuring the first week of school Sept. 1-4, students, regardless of whether they chose the in-person or virtual learning option, will attend school one day that week. This will allow students to meet their teachers, access the new learning management system with teacher support and pick up their technology/supplies.\n\nAll students will attend school daily beginning Sept. 8.\n\nMore info can be found at www.whitnall.com/district/covid-19-response-.cfm.\n\n- Reporters Annysa Johnson, Jim Riccioli, Cathy Kozlowicz, Evan Casey and Jeff Rumage contributed to this report.\n\nContact Alec Johnson at (262) 875-9469 or alec.johnson@jrn.com.

The latest news is at the top.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and breathing trouble. Most develop only mild symptoms. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.\n\nTuesday, July 21, 2020\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial outlook for the Burlington International Airport is stable, the airport announced Tuesday.\n\nMoody's Investors Service affirmed the airport's Baa2 credit rating with the stable outlook earlier this month. The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday.

All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained.

Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep.

We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19.

Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal.

Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSchool district quality is one of the most important factors homebuyers consider when looking for a place to live – particularly for new or expecting parents. A good school district can greatly increase a child’s chances of future success.\n\nOf course, the influences that can shape a child’s future are not strictly limited to the classroom. Conditions in the home and the broader community also have an effect.\n\nUsing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics, 24/7 Wall St. developed an index of measures, including the child poverty rate, the teacher-to-student ratio, per-pupil spending, the share of adults with a college education, and the high school graduation rate to determine the school district where students are most likely to succeed in every state. In our analysis, we also reviewed a number of measures of district outcomes, including college entrance exam performance and subject proficiency tests from education and community data clearing house, Niche. While favorable rankings in these measures will not alone ensure children's chances for success through their school years and into adulthood, they can provide them with considerable advantages.\n\nOne of the most important predictors of a child’s academic success is their poverty status. Children living below the poverty line are more likely to report poor physical health and have reduced ability to concentrate and retain information. Childhood poverty increases the likelihood of low test scores and reduces a student’s chances of completing high school. For this reason, the child poverty rate was selected as a component in the index. Here is a state-by-state look at the child poverty rate.\n\nIt is important to note that education policy is decided largely at the state level, and partially as a result, the difference in school district quality across a state can be lower than it is between states. A district that ranks as the best in a given state will not necessarily rank favorably among districts in other states. Here is a list of the states with the best and worst schools.\n\nInvesting:What's a bear market and why are stocks about to enter one?\n\nTesla milestone:Elon Musk congratulates electric vehicle manufacturer on making 1 million electric cars\n\n1. Alabama: Mountain Brook Schools\n\n• Location: Jefferson County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $13,303\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 85.1%\n\nAlabama's Mountain Brook School District, located just outside of Birmingham, educates over 4,000 students in grades K-12 in six different schools. While there is no direct link between school spending and outcomes, schools with greater financial resources can often offer students with a broader range of opportunities. Per pupil spending in the Mountain Brook district is over $13,000 per year, the most of any district in Alabama.\n\nChildren in the district are also less likely than most to be disadvantaged outside of the classroom. For example, the stresses associated with living in poverty can hurt academic performance, and in Mountain Brook, just 6.5% of school-age children live below the poverty line, well below the 17% U.S. child poverty rate.\n\n2. Alaska: Juneau School District\n\n• Location: Juneau City and Borough\n\n• Annual per student spending: $16,494\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 39.5%\n\nA child's academic performance tends to increase with parental educational attainment – and in the Juneau School District, parents are more likely to have a college education than parents nationwide. An estimated 39.5% of adults 25 and over in the district have a bachelor's degree, well above the 31.5% national rate.\n\nStudents in the Juneau district are also more likely to be enrolled in Advanced Placement classes than those in any other district in the state. Of the nearly 5,000 students in the district, 7.9% are enrolled in an AP class.\n\n3. Arizona: Catalina Foothills School District 16\n\n• Location: Pima County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $7,070\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 70.1%\n\nThe Catalina Foothills School District 16, located in the northern part of the Tucson metropolitan area, ranks as the best district in Arizona. The district has one of the most affluent populations in the country, as well as one of the most highly educated – approximately 70% of adults have a bachelor's degree. Students who grow up in an affluent household with college-educated parents are more likely to achieve academic success.\n\nThe school district's per student spending per year is lower than many of the school districts on this list, at just over $7,000 per pupil.\n\n4. Arkansas: Valley View Schools\n\n• Location: Craighead County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,692\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 45.3%\n\nValley View School District, located in northeastern Arkansas, enrolls about 3,000 students across four schools. The district's ranking on this list is due in large part to positive educational outcomes, as over 90% of high school freshman graduate in four years.\n\nThe greater likelihood of academic success in the district is partially due to factors outside the classroom. For example, children raised by college-educated parents are more likely than most to do well in school. Across Valley View District, 45.3% of adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, well above the comparable 31.5% share of adults nationwide.\n\n5. California: Palo Alto Unified School District\n\n• Location: Santa Clara County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $19,648\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 83.8%\n\nPublic school spending on a per student basis is nearly $20,000 per year in the Palo Alto School District. The high spending is due in part to high revenue from property taxes as Palo Alto is one of the wealthiest parts of the country with relatively expensive real estate.\n\nWhile high per student spending does not necessarily translate to positive outcomes, the district boasts a near perfect graduation rate. Additionally, over 95% of students who take one or more AP exams pass at least one.\n\n6. Colorado: Aspen School District\n\n• Location: Pitkin County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $16,820\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 69.4%\n\nAs a highly affluent school district, Colorado's Aspen School District 1 relies relatively little on state or federal revenue to fund its schools. In 2017, 83.8% of the district revenue came from local sources, close to double the average among districts nationwide of 45.8%.\n\nLiving in poverty can be a major obstacle for childhood development, and in the district, just 3.4% of children 5 to 17 live in poverty, a lower child poverty rate than the vast majority of school districts nationwide and well below the national child poverty rate of 17%.\n\n7. Connecticut: Darien Public School District\n\n• Location: Fairfield County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $21,648\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 81.3%\n\nDarien is one of the wealthiest school districts in the country, with a median annual household income of over $210,000. Likely partially as a result, per-pupil spending in the district of $21,648 exceeds the national per pupil spending average of $12,201.\n\nThe district ranks sixth out of 130 districts in the state in Niche's ranking of teacher quality. Darien High School, the only high school in the district, has an average SAT score of 1310 and an average ACT score of 30, well above average scores for high school students nationwide.\n\n8. Delaware: Appoquinimink School District\n\n• Location: New Castle County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $12,567\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 37.2%\n\nDelaware's Appoquinimink School District – which is located in the northern part of the state, approximately 20 miles south of Wilmington – ranks as the best in the state. The district's per student spending of $12,567 is in the middle of most of the districts on this list, although still slightly higher than the national per pupil spending figure of $12,201.\n\n9. Florida: St. Johns County School District\n\n• Location: St. Johns County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $8,331\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 43.7%\n\nThe St. Johns County School District is located along Florida's Atlantic coast and covers the city of St. Augustine. The school district's 88.6% graduation rate is the highest in the state and well above the 70.8% average graduation rate across all Florida school districts.\n\nChildren who grow up in financially stable households with college-educated parents are at a considerable advantage academically. In the St. Johns County School District, 43.7% of adults have a bachelor's degree, and just 6.5% of children live below the poverty line – compared to the 29.2% and 18.4% respective state averages.\n\nAcademic achievement:The best public high school in your state\n\nDegrees ahead:Boston, Seattle headline the cities with the most college graduates in every state\n\n10. Georgia: City Schools of Decatur\n\n• Location: DeKalb County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $11,657\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 72.5%\n\nGeorgia's Decatur school district spends $11,657 per student per year, well above the $10,205 statewide average. The greater school spending likely contributes to the smaller class sizes, as the district has about one teacher per 14.2 students – well below the one teacher per 15.2 students across Georgia.\n\nStudents in the Decatur District are far more likely to graduate high school than the typical student in Georgia. About 85.5% of high school students in Decatur graduate within four years, a far larger share than the 69.9% state average.\n\n11. Hawaii: Hawaii Public Schools\n\n• Location: Honolulu County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $14,322\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 32.5%\n\nHawaii is the only state to have a single school district manage every public school. Therefore, the district's ranking on this list is by default only. Still, by several measures, public school students in Hawaii have some advantages over students nationwide. For example, per student spending in the state is $14,322 compared to the national average of $12,201. Higher-spending districts often have smaller class sizes, and in Hawaii, the average student-teacher ratio of 15 to 1 is slightly lower than the 16.1 to 1 national average.\n\n12. Idaho: Moscow School District 281\n\n• Location: Latah County\n\n• Annual per student spending: $9,970\n\n• Adults with a bachelor's degree: 55.3%\n\nIdaho's Moscow School District 281 enrolls about 2,400 students in part of the northwestern section of the state.

Data on per pupil spending in 2017 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of School System Finances and was included in the index. Data on the ratio of students to teachers in the 2017-2018 school year came from the National Center for Education Statistics and was included in the index. The average freshman graduation rate for the 2009-2010 school year also came from the NCES and was included in the index. Data on the percentage of children aged 5 to 17 living in poverty in 2018 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program and was included in the index. Finally, five-year data on the percentage of adults 25 and over with at least a bachelor’s degree by school district in 2018 came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and was included in the index. Only school districts with at least 500 students and four of the five data points included in our index were considered.\n\nData on Advanced Placement enrollment and the percentage of students who took and passed at least one AP exam in the 2015-2016 school year came from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection program and were aggregated from the school level to the district level using only schools with students in grades nine through 12 exclusively.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Sauter\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in August, about half of U.S. school districts planned to reintroduce full-time in-person learning this fall, with the remainder either resuming the virtual learning processes introduced during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak or using a hybrid model.\n\nMany schools throughout the country that have attempted to start the year with full in-person classes have already had to revert to virtual learning. With regional cases high in many parts of the country and the possibility of cases resurging in the future in others, it is unclear how long before normal in-person classes will resume nationwide. Also unclear is the long-term effects that school closure and virtual learning will have on student development.\n\nAlready, the public education system in the United States lags behind the schools of many wealthy nations. According to an annual study conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. trails 24 other countries – Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. among them – in student performance in core subjects.\n\nNationwide, only about 33% of public school students about to enter high school are considered proficient in math, and 32% are considered proficient in reading, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nThese figures offer a grim assessment of the general state of American schools. Encouragingly, however, there are still public schools all over the country that offer a well-rounded and high-quality education, and where student achievement is high.\n\nEateries adapt:As winter weather approaches, restaurants get creative with outdoor dining\n\nStimulus payments:IRS extends deadline, giving millions more time to get Economic Impact Payments\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed rankings for all public schools from school data clearinghouse Niche and identified the best public high school in every state. Niche’s school rating system accounts for a range of factors, including student and parent survey responses, teacher absenteeism, standardized test scores, and other measures of academic performance. A full methodological breakdown is available here.\n\nNearly half of the schools on this list are either charter or magnet schools. Unlike regular public high schools, where place of residence is typically the only factor in enrollment, many of these schools have competitive admissions processes that are designed to select only the most motivated and talented students from both inside and outside of the school district. Unlike normal public high schools, magnet and charter schools often receive additional funding through private sources such as tuition and donations.\n\nIn many non-charter or magnet schools on this list, high student achievement is often due not only to school quality, but also to advantages outside of the classroom. For example, children of better-educated parents are themselves more likely to succeed academically. The vast majority of non-charter or magnet schools on this list are located in school districts where adults and parents are far more likely to have a four-year college education than the typical American adult. These school districts also tend to be relatively wealthy.\n\nAlabama: Loveless Academic Magnet Program High School\n\n• Location: Montgomery\n\n• Number of students: 513\n\n• Student-teacher ratio: 15-to-1\n\n• Avg.
